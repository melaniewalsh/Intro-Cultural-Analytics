   "source": [
    "What is sentiment analysis, exactly? What are we actually measuring with VADER?\n",
    "\n",
    "These are tough and important questions. According to VADER's creators, C.J. Hutto and Eric Gilbert, \"Sentiment analysis, or opinion mining, is an active area of study in the field of natural language processing that analyzes people's **opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, and emotions** via the computational treatment of subjectivity in text\" ([\"VADER\"](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/view/8109/8122)).\n",
    "\n",
    "I would like to emphasize that \"opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, and emotions\" covers a *lot* of ground. These are complex categories of human experience that can be expressed in many different ways, especially in different contexts. In fact, that's why Hutto and Gilbert designed VADER specifically for *social media* texts, because sentiment gets expressed differently in social media posts than in, say, fictional stories or newspaper articles.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to remain critical and self-reflexive about what exactly we are measuring with VADER — especially when we apply VADER to non-social media texts, as we will with \"Little Red-Cap\" below. Too often I have encountered well-meaning students who want to understand complex social or textual phenomena (e.g., mental health, a reader's emotional experience of a story, opinions about climate change) by reducing it only to sentiment analysis scores, without doing more and without thinking more deeply about whether those scores actually capture what they're interested in.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, yes, tools like VADER can be useful, as we will see below, but they are only useful when thoughtfully and deliberately applied."

    "## How VADER Was Built and How It Works\n",
    "\n",
    "VADER, which stands for **V**alence **A**ware **D**ictionary and s**E**ntiment **R**easoner, calculates the sentiment of texts by referring to a lexicon of words that have been assigned sentiment scores as well as by using a handful of simple rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can read more about how VADER was designed in [C.J. Hutto and Eric Gilbert's published paper](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/view/8109/8122), but here's a summary version: VADER's lexicon was created by enlisting 10 different people to rate thousands of words positively or negatively on a scale of -4 to 4 (you can scroll through the [lexicon on GitHub](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/master/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt) and check it out for yourself — each line consists of a word, the mean rating, standard deviation, and 10 individual human ratings).\n",
    "\n",
    "[![](../../images/VADER-fig.png)](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/view/8109/8122)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*This figure shows the interface presented to the 10 raters for rating the sentiment of words. It is taken from [\"VADER: A Parsimonious Rule-based Model for Sentiment Analysis of Social Media Text.\"](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM14/paper/view/8109/8122)* \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can see that the acronym [ROFL](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/d8da3e21374a57201b557a4c91ac4dc411a08fed/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt#L368) (Rolling on the Floor Laughing) has a mean rating of 2.7, the word [*crappy*](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/d8da3e21374a57201b557a4c91ac4dc411a08fed/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt#L1622) has a mean rating of -2.5, and the word [*bliss*](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/d8da3e21374a57201b557a4c91ac4dc411a08fed/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt#L1127) has a mean rating of 2.7. If you look at the 10 individual ratings for each entry, however, you can see interesting discrepancies. One person rated *bliss* as a 4, while another person rated *bliss* as a 1. Just how \"positive\" is the word *bliss*? What do *you* think?\n",
    "\n",
    "What about [*cutesie*](https://github.com/cjhutto/vaderSentiment/blob/d8da3e21374a57201b557a4c91ac4dc411a08fed/vaderSentiment/vader_lexicon.txt#L1721)? It has a mean rating of 1, but two people rated it as a -1, and five people rated as a 2. Is *cutesie* an admiring adjective — \"[She was so cutesie I just had to talk to her](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Cutesie)\" — or a diminutive slight — \"Ugh, her apartment was too cutesie\"?\n",
    "\n",
    "These difficult questions come up repeatedly when you read through the lexicon. Of course, VADER is designed to generalize beyond individual responses and interpretations, and it is not expected to capture the nuances of every single text. At the same time, whenever we use sentiment analysis tools, we want to ask: Does it matter that we're missing out on specific nuances? Is this the best tool for capturing what we're trying to study and understand?\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to its lexicon, VADER also calculates sentiment by considering 5 relatively simple rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 1. If there's punctuation, especially exclamation points, the sentiment intensity should be increased (e.g., \"Mochi ice cream is bliss\" 👍 vs \"Mochi ice cream is bliss!!!\" 👍👍👍 )\n",
    "\n",
    "> 2. If there's capitalization, especially all caps, the sentiment intensity should be increased (e.g., \"Mochi ice cream is bliss\" 👍 vs \"Mochi ice cream is BLISS\" 👍👍👍 )\n",
    "\n",
    "> 3. If there are words like \"extremely\" or \"absolutely\", the sentiment should be increased (\"Mochi ice cream is good\" 👍  vs \"Mochi ice cream is extremely good\" 👍👍👍 )\n",
    "\n",
    "> 4. If there's a \"but\" in a sentence, the polarity of the sentiment should shift, and the sentiment that follows the \"but\" should be prioritized (e.g., \"Mochi ice cream is nice\" 👍 vs \"Mochi ice cream is nice, but it's a little blah\" 👎 )\n",
    "\n",
    "> 5. If there's a negation before an important word, the sentiment polarity should be flipped (\"Mochi ice cream is my favorite\" 👍 vs \"Mochi ice cream is not my favorite\" 👎 )\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Because VADER uses this lexicon and these simple rules, it works very fast and doesn't require any training or set up, unlike more sophisticated machine learning approaches. The simplicity is both its pro and con."

       " 'There was nothing that she would not have given the child!',\n",
       " 'Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would not wear anything else.',\n",
       " 'So she was always called Little Red-Cap.',\n",
       " 'One day, her Mother said to her, “Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine.',\n",
       " 'Take them to your Grandmother.',\n",
       " 'She is ill and weak, and they will do her good.',\n",
       " 'Set out before it gets hot.',\n",
       " 'Walk nicely and quietly.',\n",
       " 'Do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle; then your Grandmother will get nothing!',\n",
       " 'When you go into her room, don’t forget to say ‘Good morning,’ and don’t stop to peep into every corner, before you do it.”  “I’ll take great care,” said Little Red-Cap to her Mother, and gave her hand on it.',\n",
       " 'The Grandmother lived in the wood, half an hour’s distance from the village, and just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a Wolf met her.',\n",
       " 'Red-Cap did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.',\n",
       " '“Good-day, Little Red-Cap,” said he.',\n",
       " '“Thank you kindly, Wolf.”  “Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?”  “To my Grandmother’s.”  “What have you got in your apron?”  “Cake and wine.',\n",
       " 'Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick Grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.”  “Where does your Grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?”  “A good quarter of an hour farther on in the wood.',\n",
       " 'Her house stands under the three large oak-trees; the nut-trees are just below.',\n",
       " 'You surely must know it,” replied Little Red-Cap.',\n",
       " 'The Wolf thought to himself, “What a tender young creature!',\n",
       " 'what a nice plump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman.',\n",
       " 'I must act craftily, so as to catch both.”  He walked for a short time by the side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said, “See, Little Red-Cap, how pretty the flowers are about here--why do you not look round?',\n",
       " 'I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing.',\n",
       " 'You walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else in the wood is merry.”  Little Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought, “Suppose I take Grandmother a fresh nosegay.',\n",
       " 'That would please her too.',\n",
       " 'It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time.”  And so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers.',\n",
       " 'And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and thus got deeper and deeper into the wood.',\n",
       " 'Meanwhile, the Wolf ran straight to the Grandmother’s house and knocked at the door.',\n",
       " '“Who is there?”  “Little Red-Cap,” replied the Wolf.',\n",
       " '“She is bringing cake and wine.',\n",
       " 'Open the door.”  “Lift the latch,” called out the Grandmother, “I am too weak, and cannot get up.”  The Wolf lifted the latch, the door flew open, and without saying a word he went straight to the Grandmother’s bed, and devoured her.',\n",
       " 'Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap, laid himself in bed, and drew the curtains.',\n",
       " 'Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers.',\n",
       " 'When she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her Grandmother, and set out on the way to her.',\n",
       " 'She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open.',\n",
       " 'And when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling, that she said to herself, “Oh dear!',\n",
       " 'how uneasy I feel to-day, and at other times I like being with Grandmother so much.”  She called out, “Good morning,” but received no answer.',\n",
       " 'So she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.',\n",
       " 'There lay her Grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.',\n",
       " '“Oh!',\n",
       " 'Grandmother,” she said, “what big ears you have!”  “The better to hear you with, my Child,” was the reply.',\n",
       " '“But, Grandmother, what big eyes you have!” she said.',\n",
       " '“The better to see you with, my dear.”  “But, Grandmother, what large hands you have!”  “The better to hug you with.”  “Oh!',\n",
       " 'but Grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!”  “The better to eat you with!” And scarcely had the Wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Red-Cap.',\n",
       " 'When the Wolf had satisfied his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud.',\n",
       " 'The huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself, “How the old woman is snoring!',\n",
       " 'I must just see if she wants anything.”  So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw the Wolf lying in it.',\n",
       " '“Do I find thee here, thou old sinner!” said he.',\n",
       " '“I have long sought thee!”  Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the Wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved.',\n",
       " 'So he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping Wolf.',\n",

      "0 LITTLE RED-CAP   Once upon a time, there was a sweet little girl, who was loved by every one who looked at her, and most of all by her Grandmother.\n",
      "1 There was nothing that she would not have given the child!\n",
      "2 Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would not wear anything else.\n",
      "3 So she was always called Little Red-Cap.\n",
      "4 One day, her Mother said to her, “Come, Little Red-Cap, here is a piece of cake and a bottle of wine.\n",
      "5 Take them to your Grandmother.\n",
      "6 She is ill and weak, and they will do her good.\n",
      "7 Set out before it gets hot.\n",
      "8 Walk nicely and quietly.\n",
      "9 Do not run off the path, or you may fall and break the bottle; then your Grandmother will get nothing!\n",
      "10 When you go into her room, don’t forget to say ‘Good morning,’ and don’t stop to peep into every corner, before you do it.”  “I’ll take great care,” said Little Red-Cap to her Mother, and gave her hand on it.\n",
      "11 The Grandmother lived in the wood, half an hour’s distance from the village, and just as Little Red-Cap entered the wood, a Wolf met her.\n",
      "12 Red-Cap did not know what a wicked creature he was, and was not at all afraid of him.\n",
      "13 “Good-day, Little Red-Cap,” said he.\n",
      "14 “Thank you kindly, Wolf.”  “Whither away so early, Little Red-Cap?”  “To my Grandmother’s.”  “What have you got in your apron?”  “Cake and wine.\n",
      "15 Yesterday was baking-day, so poor sick Grandmother is to have something good, to make her stronger.”  “Where does your Grandmother live, Little Red-Cap?”  “A good quarter of an hour farther on in the wood.\n",
      "16 Her house stands under the three large oak-trees; the nut-trees are just below.\n",
      "17 You surely must know it,” replied Little Red-Cap.\n",
      "18 The Wolf thought to himself, “What a tender young creature!\n",
      "19 what a nice plump mouthful--she will be better to eat than the old woman.\n",
      "20 I must act craftily, so as to catch both.”  He walked for a short time by the side of Little Red-Cap, and then he said, “See, Little Red-Cap, how pretty the flowers are about here--why do you not look round?\n",
      "21 I believe, too, that you do not hear how sweetly the little birds are singing.\n",
      "22 You walk gravely along as if you were going to school, while everything else in the wood is merry.”  Little Red-Cap raised her eyes, and when she saw the sunbeams dancing here and there through the trees, and pretty flowers growing everywhere, she thought, “Suppose I take Grandmother a fresh nosegay.\n",
      "23 That would please her too.\n",
      "24 It is so early in the day that I shall still get there in good time.”  And so she ran from the path into the wood to look for flowers.\n",
      "25 And whenever she had picked one, she fancied that she saw a still prettier one farther on, and ran after it, and thus got deeper and deeper into the wood.\n",
      "26 Meanwhile, the Wolf ran straight to the Grandmother’s house and knocked at the door.\n",
      "27 “Who is there?”  “Little Red-Cap,” replied the Wolf.\n",
      "28 “She is bringing cake and wine.\n",
      "29 Open the door.”  “Lift the latch,” called out the Grandmother, “I am too weak, and cannot get up.”  The Wolf lifted the latch, the door flew open, and without saying a word he went straight to the Grandmother’s bed, and devoured her.\n",
      "30 Then he put on her clothes, dressed himself in her cap, laid himself in bed, and drew the curtains.\n",
      "31 Little Red-Cap, however, had been running about picking flowers.\n",
      "32 When she had gathered so many that she could carry no more, she remembered her Grandmother, and set out on the way to her.\n",
      "33 She was surprised to find the cottage-door standing open.\n",
      "34 And when she went into the room, she had such a strange feeling, that she said to herself, “Oh dear!\n",
      "35 how uneasy I feel to-day, and at other times I like being with Grandmother so much.”  She called out, “Good morning,” but received no answer.\n",
      "36 So she went to the bed and drew back the curtains.\n",
      "37 There lay her Grandmother with her cap pulled far over her face, and looking very strange.\n",
      "38 “Oh!\n",
      "39 Grandmother,” she said, “what big ears you have!”  “The better to hear you with, my Child,” was the reply.\n",
      "40 “But, Grandmother, what big eyes you have!” she said.\n",
      "41 “The better to see you with, my dear.”  “But, Grandmother, what large hands you have!”  “The better to hug you with.”  “Oh!\n",
      "42 but Grandmother, what a terrible big mouth you have!”  “The better to eat you with!” And scarcely had the Wolf said this, than with one bound he was out of bed and swallowed up Red-Cap.\n",
      "43 When the Wolf had satisfied his appetite, he lay down again in the bed, fell asleep and began to snore very loud.\n",
      "44 The huntsman was just passing the house, and thought to himself, “How the old woman is snoring!\n",
      "45 I must just see if she wants anything.”  So he went into the room, and when he came to the bed, he saw the Wolf lying in it.\n",
      "46 “Do I find thee here, thou old sinner!” said he.\n",
      "47 “I have long sought thee!”  Then just as he was going to fire at him, it occurred to him that the Wolf might have devoured the grandmother, and that she might still be saved.\n",
      "48 So he did not fire, but took a pair of scissors, and began to cut open the stomach of the sleeping Wolf.\n",
      "49 When he had made two snips, he saw the little Red-Cap shining, and then he made two snips more, and the little girl sprang out, crying, “Ah, how frightened I have been!\n",
      "50 How dark it was inside the Wolf!”  And after that the aged grandmother came out alive also, but scarcely able to breathe.\n",
      "51 Red-Cap then quickly fetched great stones with which they filled the Wolf’s body.\n",
      "52 And when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he tumbled down at once, and fell dead.\n",
      "53 Then all three were delighted.\n",
      "54 The huntsman drew off the Wolf’s skin and went home with it.\n",
      "55 The grandmother ate the cake and drank the wine which Red-Cap had brought, and grew strong again.\n",
      "56 But Red-Cap thought to herself, “As long as I live, I will never leave the path to run into the wood, when my mother has forbidden me to do so.”\n"

    "\n",
    "The story arc begins positively with Little Red-Cap, \"a sweet little girl...loved by every\n",
    "one who looked at her,\" setting off into the woods and picking flowers in the sunshine. Then it dips severely when she gets to her grandmother's home, discovers the wolf in her grandmother's clothing, and gets devoured by the wolf. Finally it picks up again when the huntsman cuts open the wolf's stomach and saves Little Red-Cap and her grandmother, and the wolf ultimately dies.\n",
    "\n",
    "But it should be noted that this is a short and relatively simple story that has very clearly positive and negative words, and VADER does not work as well for all fictional stories.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also some tricky moments in this story that help capture how difficult it is to use technologies like VADER to study plot or emotional arcs in stories. For example, the most negative sentence in the story is the moment when the wolf dies: \"And when he awoke, he wanted to run away, but the stones were so heavy that he tumbled down at once, and fell dead.\" Surely this is a negative moment for the wolf, but is this a negative moment for Little Red-Cap, her grandmother, the huntsman, or the reader? It may actually be one of the most positive and triumphant moments. This contradiction helps demonstrate that fictional texts do not typically express straightforward opinions and attitudes the way a social media post might, and thus students and researchers must be careful, cautious, and deliberate when applying sentiment analysis tools to fiction."
