      "By Charlotte Perkins Gilman\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is very seldom that mere ordinary people like John and myself secure\n",
      "ancestral halls for the summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "A colonial mansion, a hereditary estate, I would say a haunted house, and\n",
      "reach the height of romantic felicity—but that would be asking too\n",
      "much of fate!\n",
      "\n",
      "Still I will proudly declare that there is something queer about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Else, why should it be let so cheaply? And why have stood so long\n",
      "untenanted?\n",
      "\n",
      "John laughs at me, of course, but one expects that in marriage.\n",
      "\n",
      "John is practical in the extreme. He has no patience with faith, an\n",
      "intense horror of superstition, and he scoffs openly at any talk of things\n",
      "not to be felt and seen and put down in figures.\n",
      "\n",
      "John is a physician, and perhaps—(I would not say it to a living\n",
      "soul, of course, but this is dead paper and a great relief to my\n",
      "mind)—perhaps that is one reason I do not get well faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "You see, he does not believe I am sick!\n",
      "\n",
      "And what can one do?\n",
      "\n",
      "If a physician of high standing, and one’s own husband, assures friends\n",
      "and relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but\n",
      "temporary nervous depression—a slight hysterical tendency—what\n",
      "is one to do?\n",
      "\n",
      "My brother is also a physician, and also of high standing, and he says the\n",
      "same thing.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I take phosphates or phosphites—whichever it is, and tonics, and\n",
      "journeys, and air, and exercise, and am absolutely forbidden to “work”\n",
      "until I am well again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personally, I disagree with their ideas.\n",
      "\n",
      "Personally, I believe that congenial work, with excitement and change,\n",
      "would do me good.\n",
      "\n",
      "But what is one to do?\n",
      "\n",
      "I did write for a while in spite of them; but it does exhaust me a good\n",
      "deal—having to be so sly about it, or else meet with heavy\n",
      "opposition.\n",
      "\n",
      "I sometimes fancy that in my condition if I had less opposition and more\n",
      "society and stimulus—but John says the very worst thing I can do is\n",
      "to think about my condition, and I confess it always makes me feel bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "So I will let it alone and talk about the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "The most beautiful place! It is quite alone, standing well back from the\n",
      "road, quite three miles from the village. It makes me think of English\n",
      "places that you read about, for there are hedges and walls and gates that\n",
      "lock, and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners and people.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a delicious garden! I never saw such a garden—large and\n",
      "shady, full of box-bordered paths, and lined with long grape-covered\n",
      "arbors with seats under them.\n",
      "\n",
      "There were greenhouses, too, but they are all broken now.\n",
      "\n",
      "There was some legal trouble, I believe, something about the heirs and\n",
      "co-heirs; anyhow, the place has been empty for years.\n",
      "\n",
      "That spoils my ghostliness, I am afraid; but I don’t care—there is\n",
      "something strange about the house—I can feel it.\n",
      "\n",
      "I even said so to John one moonlight evening, but he said what I felt was\n",
      "a draught, and shut the window.\n",
      "\n",
      "I get unreasonably angry with John sometimes. I’m sure I never used to be\n",
      "so sensitive. I think it is due to this nervous condition.\n",
      "\n",
      "But John says if I feel so I shall neglect proper self-control; so I take\n",
      "pains to control myself,—before him, at least,—and that makes\n",
      "me very tired.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t like our room a bit. I wanted one downstairs that opened on the\n",
      "piazza and had roses all over the window, and such pretty old-fashioned\n",
      "chintz hangings! but John would not hear of it.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said there was only one window and not room for two beds, and no near\n",
      "room for him if he took another.\n",
      "\n",
      "He is very careful and loving, and hardly lets me stir without special\n",
      "direction.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day; he takes all care\n",
      "from me, and so I feel basely ungrateful not to value it more.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said we came here solely on my account, that I was to have perfect rest\n",
      "and all the air I could get. “Your exercise depends on your strength, my\n",
      "dear,” said he, “and your food somewhat on your appetite; but air you\n",
      "can absorb all the time.” So we took the nursery, at the top of the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a big, airy room, the whole floor nearly, with windows that look all\n",
      "ways, and air and sunshine galore. It was nursery first and then\n",
      "playground\n",
      "and gymnasium, I should judge; for the windows are barred for little\n",
      "children, and there are rings and things in the walls.\n",
      "\n",
      "The paint and paper look as if a boys’ school had used it. It is stripped\n",
      "off—the paper—in great patches all around the head of my bed,\n",
      "about as far as I can reach, and in a great place on the other side of the\n",
      "room low down. I never saw a worse paper in my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of those sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic sin.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is dull enough to confuse the eye in following, pronounced enough to\n",
      "constantly irritate, and provoke study, and when you follow the lame,\n",
      "uncertain curves for a little distance they suddenly commit suicide—plunge\n",
      "off at outrageous angles, destroy themselves in unheard-of contradictions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The color is repellant, almost revolting; a smouldering, unclean yellow,\n",
      "strangely faded by the slow-turning sunlight.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is a dull yet lurid orange in some places, a sickly sulphur tint in\n",
      "others.\n",
      "\n",
      "No wonder the children hated it! I should hate it myself if I had to live\n",
      "in this room long.\n",
      "\n",
      "There comes John, and I must put this away,—he hates to have me\n",
      "write a word.\n",
      "\n",
      "We have been here two weeks, and I haven’t felt like writing before, since\n",
      "that first day.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am sitting by the window now, up in this atrocious nursery, and there is\n",
      "nothing to hinder my writing as much as I please, save lack of strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "John is away all day, and even some nights when his cases are serious.\n",
      "\n",
      "I am glad my case is not serious!\n",
      "\n",
      "But these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing.\n",
      "\n",
      "John does not know how much I really suffer. He knows there is no reason\n",
      "to suffer, and that satisfies him.\n",
      "\n",
      "Of course it is only nervousness. It does weigh on me so not to do my duty\n",
      "in any way!\n",
      "\n",
      "I meant to be such a help to John, such a real rest and comfort, and here\n",
      "I am a comparative burden already!\n",
      "\n",
      "Nobody would believe what an effort it is to do what little I am able—to\n",
      "dress and entertain, and order things.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is fortunate Mary is so good with the baby. Such a dear baby!\n",
      "\n",
      "And yet I cannot be with him, it makes me so nervous.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose John never was nervous in his life. He laughs at me so about\n",
      "this wallpaper!\n",
      "\n",
      "At first he meant to repaper the room, but afterwards he said that I was\n",
      "letting it get the better of me, and that nothing was worse for a nervous\n",
      "patient than to give way to such fancies.\n",
      "\n",
      "He said that after the wallpaper was changed it would be the heavy\n",
      "bedstead, and then the barred windows, and then that gate at the head of\n",
      "the stairs, and so on.\n",
      "\n",
      "“You know the place is doing you good,” he said, “and really, dear, I\n",
      "don’t care to renovate the house just for a three months’ rental.”\n",
      "\n",
      "“Then do let us go downstairs,” I said, “there are such pretty rooms\n",
      "there.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Then he took me in his arms and called me a blessed little goose, and said\n",
      "he would go down cellar if I wished, and have it whitewashed into\n",
      "the bargain.\n",
      "\n",
      "But he is right enough about the beds and windows and things.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is as airy and comfortable a room as any one need wish, and, of course,\n",
      "I\n",
      "would not be so silly as to make him uncomfortable just for a whim.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m really getting quite fond of the big room, all but that horrid paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of one window I can see the garden, those mysterious deep-shaded\n",
      "arbors, the riotous old-fashioned flowers, and bushes and gnarly trees.\n",
      "\n",
      "Out of another I get a lovely view of the bay and a little private wharf\n",
      "belonging to the estate. There is a beautiful shaded lane that runs down\n",
      "there from the house. I always fancy I see people walking in these\n",
      "numerous paths and arbors, but John has cautioned me not to give way to\n",
      "fancy in the least. He says that with my imaginative power and habit of\n",
      "story-making a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to all manner\n",
      "of excited fancies, and that I ought to use my will and good sense to\n",
      "check the tendency. So I try.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think sometimes that if I were only well enough to write a little it\n",
      "would relieve the press of ideas and rest me.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I find I get pretty tired when I try.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about my\n",
      "work. When I get really well John says we will ask Cousin Henry and Julia\n",
      "down for a long visit; but he says he would as soon put fire-works in my\n",
      "pillow-case as to let me have those stimulating people about now.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wish I could get well faster.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I must not think about that. This paper looks to me as if it knew what\n",
      "a vicious influence it had!\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a recurrent spot where the pattern lolls like a broken neck and\n",
      "two bulbous eyes stare at you upside-down.\n",
      "\n",
      "I get positively angry with the impertinence of it and the\n",
      "everlastingness. Up and down and sideways they crawl, and those absurd,\n",
      "unblinking eyes are everywhere. There is one place where two breadths\n",
      "didn’t match, and the eyes go all up and down the line, one a little\n",
      "higher than the other.\n",
      "\n",
      "I never saw so much expression in an inanimate thing before, and we all\n",
      "know how much expression they have! I used to lie awake as a child and get\n",
      "more entertainment and terror out of blank walls and plain furniture than\n",
      "most children could find in a toy-store.\n",
      "\n",
      "I remember what a kindly wink the knobs of our big old bureau used to\n",
      "have, and there was one chair that always seemed like a strong friend.\n",
      "\n",
      "I used to feel that if any of the other things looked too fierce I could\n",
      "always hop into that chair and be safe.\n",
      "\n",
      "The furniture in this room is no worse than inharmonious, however, for we\n",
      "had to bring it all from downstairs. I suppose when this was used as a\n",
      "playroom they had to take the nursery things out, and no wonder! I never\n",
      "saw such ravages as the children have made here.\n",
      "\n",
      "The wallpaper, as I said before, is torn off in spots, and it sticketh\n",
      "closer than a brother—they must have had perseverance as well as\n",
      "hatred.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the floor is scratched and gouged and splintered, the plaster itself\n",
      "is dug out here and there, and this great heavy bed, which is all we found\n",
      "in the room, looks as if it had been through the wars.\n",
      "\n",
      "But I don’t mind it a bit—only the paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "There comes John’s sister. Such a dear girl as she is, and so careful of\n",
      "me! I must not let her find me writing.\n",
      "\n",
      "She is a perfect, and enthusiastic housekeeper, and hopes for no better\n",
      "profession. I verily believe she thinks it is the writing which made me\n",
      "sick!\n",
      "\n",
      "But I can write when she is out, and see her a long way off from these\n",
      "windows.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is one that commands the road, a lovely, shaded, winding road, and\n",
      "one\n",
      "that just looks off over the country. A lovely country, too, full of great\n",
      "elms and velvet meadows.\n",
      "\n",
      "This wallpaper has a kind of sub-pattern in a different shade, a\n",
      "particularly irritating one, for you can only see it in certain lights,\n",
      "and not clearly then.\n",
      "\n",
      "But in the places where it isn’t faded, and where the sun is just so, I\n",
      "can see a strange, provoking, formless sort of figure, that seems to sulk\n",
      "about behind that silly and conspicuous front design.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "When the sun shoots in through the east window—I always watch for\n",

      "By moonlight—the moon shines in all night when there is a moon—I\n",

      "\n",
      "At night in any kind of light, in twilight, candlelight, lamplight, and\n",

      "\n",

      "I lie down ever so much now. John says it is good for me, and to sleep all\n",
      "I can.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, he started the habit by making me lie down for an hour after each\n",

      "\n",
      "It is a very bad habit, I am convinced, for, you see, I don’t sleep.\n",

      "It strikes me occasionally, just as a scientific hypothesis, that\n",
      "perhaps it is the paper!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have watched John when he did not know I was looking, and come into the\n",
      "room suddenly on the most innocent excuses, and I’ve caught him several\n",
      "times looking at the paper! And Jennie too. I caught Jennie with her hand\n",
      "on it once.\n",
      "\n",
      "She didn’t know I was in the room, and when I asked her in a quiet, a very\n",
      "quiet voice, with the most restrained manner possible, what she was doing\n",
      "with the paper she turned around as if she had been caught stealing,\n",
      "and looked quite angry—asked me why I should frighten her so!\n",
      "\n",
      "Then she said that the paper stained everything it touched, that she had\n",
      "found yellow smooches on all my clothes and John’s, and she wished we\n",
      "would be more careful!\n",
      "\n",
      "Did not that sound innocent? But I know she was studying that pattern, and\n",
      "I am determined that nobody shall find it out but myself!\n",
      "\n",
      "Life is very much more exciting now than it used to be. You see I have\n",
      "something more to expect, to look forward to, to watch. I really do eat\n",
      "better, and am more quiet than I was.\n",
      "\n",
      "John is so pleased to see me improve! He laughed a little the other day,\n",
      "and said I seemed to be flourishing in spite of my wallpaper.\n",
      "\n",
      "I turned it off with a laugh. I had no intention of telling him it was\n",
      "because of the wallpaper—he would make fun of me. He might even\n",
      "want to take me away.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t want to leave now until I have found it out. There is a week more,\n",
      "and I think that will be enough.\n",
      "\n",
      "I’m feeling ever so much better! I don’t sleep much at night, for it is so\n",
      "interesting to watch developments; but I sleep a good deal in the daytime.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the daytime it is tiresome and perplexing.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are always new shoots on the fungus, and new shades of yellow all\n",
      "over it. I cannot keep count of them, though I have tried conscientiously.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the strangest yellow, that wallpaper! It makes me think of all the\n",
      "yellow things I ever saw—not beautiful ones like buttercups, but old\n",
      "foul, bad yellow things.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is something else about that paper—the smell! I noticed it\n",
      "the moment we came into the room, but with so much air and sun it was not\n",
      "bad. Now we have had a week of fog and rain, and whether the windows are\n",
      "open or not, the smell is here.\n",
      "\n",
      "It creeps all over the house.\n",
      "\n",
      "I find it hovering in the dining-room, skulking in the parlor, hiding in\n",
      "the hall, lying in wait for me on the stairs.\n",
      "\n",
      "It gets into my hair.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even when I go to ride, if I turn my head suddenly and surprise it—there\n",
      "is that smell!\n",
      "\n",
      "Such a peculiar odor, too! I have spent hours in trying to analyze it, to\n",
      "find what it smelled like.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not bad—at first, and very gentle, but quite the subtlest,\n",
      "most enduring odor I ever met.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this damp weather it is awful. I wake up in the night and find it\n",
      "hanging over me.\n",
      "\n",
      "It used to disturb me at first. I thought seriously of burning the\n",
      "house—to\n",
      "reach the smell.\n",
      "\n",
      "But now I am used to it. The only thing I can think of that it is like is\n",
      "the color of the paper! A yellow smell.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a very funny mark on this wall, low down, near the mopboard. A\n",
      "streak that runs round the room. It goes behind every piece of furniture,\n",
      "except the bed, a long, straight, even smooch, as if it had been rubbed\n",
      "over and over.\n",
      "\n",
      "I wonder how it was done and who did it, and what they did it for. Round\n",
      "and round and round—round and round and round—it makes me\n",
      "dizzy!\n",
      "\n",
      "I really have discovered something at last.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through watching so much at night, when it changes so, I have finally\n",
      "found out.\n",
      "\n",
      "The front pattern does move—and no wonder! The woman behind shakes\n",
      "it!\n",
      "\n",
      "Sometimes I think there are a great many women behind, and sometimes only\n",
      "one, and she crawls around fast, and her crawling shakes it all over.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then in the very bright spots she keeps still, and in the very shady spots\n",
      "she just takes hold of the bars and shakes them hard.\n",
      "\n",
      "And she is all the time trying to climb through. But nobody could climb\n",
      "through that pattern—it strangles so; I think that is why it has so\n",
      "many heads.\n",
      "\n",
      "They get through, and then the pattern strangles them off and turns them\n",
      "upside-down, and makes their eyes white!\n",
      "\n",
      "If those heads were covered or taken off it would not be half so bad.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think that woman gets out in the daytime!\n",
      "\n",
      "And I’ll tell you why—privately—I’ve seen her!\n",
      "\n",
      "I can see her out of every one of my windows!\n",
      "\n",
      "It is the same woman, I know, for she is always creeping, and most women\n",
      "do not creep by daylight.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see her on that long shaded lane, creeping up and down. I see her in\n",
      "those\n",
      "dark grape arbors, creeping all around the garden.\n",
      "\n",
      "I see her on that long road under the trees, creeping along, and when a\n",
      "carriage comes she hides under the blackberry vines.\n",
      "\n",
      "I don’t blame her a bit. It must be very humiliating to be caught creeping\n",
      "by daylight!\n",
      "\n",
      "I always lock the door when I creep by daylight. I can’t do it at night,\n",
      "for I know John would suspect something at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "And John is so queer now, that I don’t want to irritate him. I wish he\n",
      "would take another room! Besides, I don’t want anybody to get that woman\n",
      "out at night but myself.\n",
      "\n",
      "I often wonder if I could see her out of all the windows at once.\n",
      "\n",
      "But, turn as fast as I can, I can only see out of one at one time.\n",
      "\n",
      "And though I always see her she may be able to creep faster than I can\n",
      "turn!\n",
      "\n",
      "I have watched her sometimes away off in the open country, creeping as\n",
      "fast as a cloud shadow in a high wind.\n",
      "\n",
      "If only that top pattern could be gotten off from the under one! I mean to\n",
      "try it, little by little.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have found out another funny thing, but I shan’t tell it this time! It\n",
      "does not do to trust people too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are only two more days to get this paper off, and I believe John is\n",
      "beginning to notice. I don’t like the look in his eyes.\n",
      "\n",
      "And I heard him ask Jennie a lot of professional questions about me. She\n",
      "had a very good report to give.\n",
      "\n",
      "She said I slept a good deal in the daytime.\n",
      "\n",
      "John knows I don’t sleep very well at night, for all I’m so quiet!\n",
      "\n",
      "He asked me all sorts of questions, too, and pretended to be very loving\n",
      "and kind.\n",
      "\n",
      "As if I couldn’t see through him!\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, I don’t wonder he acts so, sleeping under this paper for three\n",
      "months.\n",
      "\n",
