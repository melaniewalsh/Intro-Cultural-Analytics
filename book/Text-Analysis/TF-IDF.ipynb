    "In the next lessons, we're going to learn about a text analysis method called *term frequency–inverse document frequency*, often abbreviated *tf-idf*.\n",
    "\n",
    "While calculating the most frequent words in a text can be useful, the most frequent words in a text usually aren't the most interesting words in a text, even if we get rid of stop words (\"the, \"and,\" \"to,\" etc.). Tf-idf is a method that builds off word frequency but it more specifically tries to identify the most distinctively frequent and significant words. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you already have a collection of plain text (.txt) files that you'd like to analyze, one of the easiest ways to calculate tf-idf scores is to use the Python library scikit-learn. It has a quick and nifty module called [TfidfVectorizer](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.TfidfVectorizer.html), which does all the math for you behind the scenes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also cover how to calculate tf-idf scores for in-copyright texts using extracted features from the [HathiTrust Digital Library](https://www.hathitrust.org/), which contains digitized books from Google Books as well as many university libraries."
