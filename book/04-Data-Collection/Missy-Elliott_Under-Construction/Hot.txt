(Missy)
This is an old school Missy exclusive

Look!
I ain't on no ra-ra shit
You dont wanna test how far Miss get
Me and Timothy cars got kits
But we don't drive around trying to prove you shit
Everyone tryna be that bitch
But there can only be one bitch make hits
I know I must make y'all sick
Cuz after I spit, you beg to quit
I used to drive a six
And then I bought a Murciélago to sit
On the plush leather seats, forget
Am I on my own clit?
Yes I must admit
And my ass is it
Misdemeanor have you seen her?  I'm the best it get
And those who try to test this chick
Where they at right now?  In peace resting in

If you broke
Just say you broke
Cuz' all you blowin' up ya ass is some smoke
Cuz rich folks, we buy boats
And you's a bum broke nigga that's for sure
I know you broke, just say you broke
Cuz' all you blowin' up ya ass is some smoke
Cuz rich folks, we buy boats
And you's a bum broke liar that's for sure

Yeah boo you know you a joke
Wear a fake Rolex, call it a Ro
Act like you down with so and so
Ya whack on wax, bows I came to throw
I might just let you mop my flow
For my autograph take this flick to go
(CHEESE)
Miss don't say no mo'
Cuz you know what I do
And you know what I know
And I don't think so
You don't wanna lose a arm or elbow
If ya broke then just say so
Cuz the Bentley that you renting
Yo it's got to go
Back to the black man store
Along with ya weave cop a new afro
Why you wanna make Miss stoop so low
But if you try to test me I just check ya slow
(Chorus)
If you broke
Just say you broke
Cuz' all you blowin' up ya ass is some smoke
Cuz rich folks, we buy boats
And you's a bum broke nigga that's for sure
I know you broke, just say you broke
Cuz' all you blowin' up ya ass is some smoke
Cuz rich folks, we buy boats
And you's a bum broke liar that's for sure

In old school we used to call out names
But I ain't tryin' to give ya no fame
My credit card gonna bring ya pain
To know ya account just hold change
No need to wreck ya brains
Trying to see who Missy gon' slain
I roll solo not with a gang
I don't carry guns kick ass wit a chain
Don't let me say it again
I don't carry guns kick ass with a chain
(WHASSSSA)
Like a Chinese man
Reverse it
(ti esrever)
Know what I'm saying
(Chorus)
If you broke
Just say you broke
Cuz' all you blowin' up ya ass is some smoke
Cuz rich folks, we buy boats
And you's a bum broke nigga that's for sure
I know you broke, just say you broke
Cuz' all you blowin' up ya ass is some smoke
Cuz rich folks, we buy boats
And you's a bum broke liar that's for sure
