PREFACE TO REVISED EDITION.


       *       *       *       *       *

Like millions of my race, my mother and father were born slaves, but
were not contented to live and die so. My father purchased himself in
early manhood by hard toil. Mother saw no way for herself and children
to escape the horrors of bondage but by flight. Bravely, with her four
little ones, with firm faith in God and an ardent desire to be free, she
forsook the prison-house, and succeeded, through the aid of my father,
to reach a free State. Here life had to be begun anew. The old familiar
slave names had to be changed, and others, for prudential reasons, had
to be found. This was not hard work. However, hardly months had passed
ere the keen scent of the slave-hunters had trailed them to where they
had fancied themselves secure. In those days all power was in the hands
of the oppressor, and the capture of a slave mother and her children was
attended with no great difficulty other than the crushing of freedom in
the breast of the victims. Without judge or jury, all were hurried back
to wear the yoke again. But back this mother was resolved never to stay.
She only wanted another opportunity to again strike for freedom. In a
few months after being carried back, with only two of her little ones,
she took her heart in her hand and her babes in her arms, and this trial
was a success. Freedom was gained, although not without the sad loss of
her two older children, whom she had to leave behind. Mother and father
were again reunited in freedom, while two of their little boys were in
slavery. What to do for them other than weep and pray, were questions
unanswerable. For over forty years the mother's heart never knew what it
was to be free from anxiety about her lost boys. But no tidings came in
answer to her many prayers, until one of them, to the great astonishment
of his relatives, turned up in Philadelphia, nearly fifty years of age,
seeking his long-lost parents. Being directed to the Anti-Slavery Office
for instructions as to the best plan to adopt to find out the
whereabouts of his parents, fortunately he fell into the hands of his
own brother, the writer, whom he had never heard of before, much less
seen or known. And here began revelations connected with this marvellous
coincidence, which influenced me, for years previous to Emancipation, to
preserve the matter found in the pages of this humble volume.

And in looking back now over these strange and eventful Providences, in
the light of the wonderful changes wrought by Emancipation, I am more
and more constrained to believe that the reasons, which years ago led me
to aid the bondman and preserve the records of his sufferings, are
to-day quite as potent in convincing me that the necessity of the times
requires this testimony.

And since the first advent of my book, wherever reviewed or read by
leading friends of freedom, the press, or the race more deeply
represented by it, the expressions of approval and encouragement have
been hearty and unanimous, and the thousands of volumes which have been
sold by me, on the subscription plan, with hardly any facilities for the
work, makes it obvious that it would, in the hands of a competent
publisher, have a wide circulation.

And here I may frankly state, that but for the hope I have always
cherished that this work would encourage the race in efforts for
self-elevation, its publication never would have been undertaken by me.

I believe no more strongly at this moment than I have believed ever
since the Proclamation of Emancipation was made by Abraham Lincoln, that
as a class, in this country, no small exertion will have to be put forth
before the blessings of freedom and knowledge can be fairly enjoyed by
this people; and until colored men manage by dint of hard acquisition to
enter the ranks of skilled industry, very little substantial respect
will be shown them, even with the ballot-box and musket in their hands.

Well-conducted shops and stores; lands acquired and good farms managed
in a manner to compete with any other; valuable books produced and
published on interesting and important subjects--these are some of the
fruits which the race are expected to exhibit from their newly gained
privileges.

If it is asked "how?" I answer, "through extraordinary determination and
endeavor," such as are demonstrated in hundreds of cases in the pages of
this book, in the struggles of men and women to obtain their freedom,
education and property.

These facts must never be lost sight of.

The race must not forget the rock from whence they were hewn, nor the
pit from whence, they were digged.

Like other races, this newly emancipated people will need all the
knowledge of their past condition which they can get.

The bondage and deliverance of the children of Israel will never be
allowed to sink into oblivion while the world stands.

Those scenes of suffering and martyrdom millions of Christians were
called upon to pass through in the days of the Inquisition are still
subjects of study, and have unabated interest for all enlightened minds.

The same is true of the history of this country. The struggles of the
pioneer fathers are preserved, produced and re-produced, and cherished
with undying interest by all Americans, and the day will not arrive
while the Republic exists, when these histories will not be found in
every library.

While the grand little army of abolitionists was waging its untiring
warfare for freedom, prior to the rebellion, no agency encouraged them
like the heroism of fugitives. The pulse of the four millions of slaves
and their desire for freedom, were better felt through "The Underground
Railroad," than through any other channel.

Frederick Douglass, Henry Bibb, Wm. Wells Brown, Rev. J.W. Logan, and
others, gave unmistakable evidence that the race had no more eloquent
advocates than its own self-emancipated champions.

Every step they took to rid themselves of their fetters, or to gain
education, or in pleading the cause of their fellow-bondmen in the
lecture-room, or with their pens, met with applause on every hand, and
the very argument needed was thus furnished in large measure. In those
dark days previous to emancipation, such testimony was indispensable.

The free colored men are as imperatively required now to furnish the
same manly testimony in support of the ability of the race to surmount
the remaining obstacles growing out of oppression, ignorance, and
poverty.

In the political struggles, the hopes of the race have been sadly
disappointed. From this direction no great advantage is likely to arise
very soon.

Only as desert can be proved by the acquisition of knowledge and the
exhibition of high moral character, in examples of economy and a
disposition to encourage industrial enterprises, conducted by men of
their own ranks, will it be possible to make political progress in the
face of the present public sentiment.

Here, therefore, in my judgment is the best possible reason for
vigorously pushing the circulation of this humble volume--that it may
testify for thousands and tens of thousands, as no other work can do.

SETH CONCKLIN.


In the long list of names who have suffered and died in the cause of
freedom, not one, perhaps, could be found whose efforts to redeem a poor
family of slaves were more Christlike than Seth Concklin's, whose noble
and daring spirit has been so long completely shrouded in mystery.
Except John Brown, it is a question, whether his rival could be found
with respect to boldness, disinterestedness and willingness to be
sacrificed for the deliverance of the oppressed.

By chance one day he came across a copy of the Pennsylvania Freeman,
containing the story of Peter Still, "the Kidnapped and the
Ransomed,"--how he had been torn away from his mother, when a little boy
six years old; how, for forty years and more, he had been compelled to
serve under the yoke, totally destitute as to any knowledge of his
parents' whereabouts; how the intense love of liberty and desire to get
back to his mother had unceasingly absorbed his mind through all these
years of bondage; how, amid the most appalling discouragements, prompted
alone by his undying determination to be free and be reunited with those
from whom he had been sold away, he contrived to buy himself; how, by
extreme economy, from doing over-work, he saved up five hundred dollars,
the amount of money required for his ransom, which, with his freedom,
he, from necessity, placed unreservedly in the confidential keeping of a
Jew, named Joseph Friedman, whom he had known for a long time and could
venture to trust,--how he had further toiled to save up money to defray
his expenses on an expedition in search of his mother and kindred; how,
when this end was accomplished, with an earnest purpose he took his
carpet-bag in his hand, and his heart throbbing for his old home and
people, he turned his mind very privately towards Philadelphia, where he
hoped, by having notices read in the colored churches to the effect that
"forty-one or forty-two years before two little boys[A] were kidnapped
and carried South"--that the memory of some of the older members might
recall the circumstances, and in this way he would be aided in his
ardent efforts to become restored to them.

[Footnote A: Sons of Levin and Sidney--the last names of his parents he
was too young to remember.]

And, furthermore, Seth Concklin had read how, on arriving in
Philadelphia, after traveling sixteen hundred miles, that almost the
first man whom Peter Still sought advice from was his own unknown
brother (whom he had never seen or heard of), who made the discovery
that he was the long-lost boy, whose history and fate had been enveloped
in sadness so long, and for whom his mother had shed so many tears and
offered so many prayers, during the long years of their separation; and,
finally, how this self-ransomed and restored captive, notwithstanding
his great success, was destined to suffer the keenest pangs of sorrow
for his wife and children, whom he had left in Alabama bondage.

Seth Concklin was naturally too singularly sympathetic and humane not to
feel now for Peter, and especially for his wife and children left in
bonds as bound with them. Hence, as Seth was a man who seemed wholly
insensible to fear, and to know no other law of humanity and right, than
whenever the claims of the suffering and the wronged appealed to him, to
respond unreservedly, whether those thus injured were amongst his
nearest kin or the greatest strangers,--it mattered not to what race or
clime they might belong,--he, in the spirit of the good Samaritan,
owning all such as his neighbors, volunteered his services, without pay
or reward, to go and rescue the wife and three children of Peter Still.

The magnitude of this offer can hardly be appreciated. It was literally
laying his life on the altar of freedom for the despised and oppressed
whom he had never seen, whose kins-folk even he was not acquainted with.
At this juncture even Peter was not prepared to accept this proposal. He
wanted to secure the freedom of his wife and children as earnestly as he
had ever desired to see his mother, yet he could not, at first, hearken
to the idea of having them rescued in the way suggested by Concklin,
fearing a failure.

To J.M. McKim and the writer, the bold scheme for the deliverance of
Peter's family was alone confided. It was never submitted to the
Vigilance Committee, for the reason, that it was not considered a matter
belonging thereto. On first reflection, the very idea of such an
undertaking seemed perfectly appalling. Frankly was he told of the great
dangers and difficulties to be encountered through hundreds of miles of
slave territory. Seth was told of those who, in attempting to aid slaves
to escape had fallen victims to the relentless Slave Power, and had
either lost their lives, or been incarcerated for long years in
penitentiaries, where no friendly aid could be afforded them; in short,
he was plainly told, that without a very great chance, the undertaking
would cost him his life. The occasion of this interview and
conversation, the seriousness of Concklin and the utter failure in
presenting the various obstacles to his plan, to create the slightest
apparent misgiving in his mind, or to produce the slightest sense of
fear or hesitancy, can never be effaced from the memory of the writer.
The plan was, however, allowed to rest for a time.

In the meanwhile, Peter's mind was continually vacillating between
Alabama, with his wife and children, and his new-found relatives in the
North. Said a brother, "If you cannot get your family, what will you do?
Will you come North and live with your relatives?" "I would as soon go
out of the world, as not to go back and do all I can for them," was the
prompt reply of Peter.

The problem of buying them was seriously considered, but here obstacles
quite formidable lay in the way. Alabama laws utterly denied the right
of a slave to buy himself, much less his wife and children. The right of
slave masters to free their slaves, either by sale or emancipation, was
positively prohibited by law. With these reflections weighing upon his
mind, having stayed away from his wife as long as he could content
himself to do, he took his carpet-bag in his hand, and turned his face
toward Alabama, to embrace his family in the prison-house of bondage.

His approach home could only be made stealthily, not daring to breathe
to a living soul, save his own family, his nominal Jew master, and one
other friend--a slave--where he had been, the prize he had found, or
anything in relation to his travels. To his wife and children his return
was unspeakably joyous. The situation of his family concerned him with
tenfold more weight than ever before,

As the time drew near to make the offer to his wife's master to purchase
her with his children, his heart failed him through fear of awakening
the ire of slaveholders against him, as he knew that the law and public
sentiment were alike deadly opposed to the spirit of freedom in the
slave. Indeed, as innocent as a step in this direction might appear, in
those days a man would have stood about as good a chance for his life in
entering a lair of hungry hyenas, as a slave or free colored man would,
in talking about freedom.

He concluded, therefore, to say nothing about buying. The plan proposed
by Seth Concklin was told to Vina, his wife; also what he had heard from
his brother about the Underground Rail Road,--how, that many who could
not get their freedom in any other way, by being aided a little, were
daily escaping to Canada. Although the wife and children had never
tasted the pleasures of freedom for a single hour in their lives, they
hated slavery heartily, and being about to be far separated from husband
and father, they were ready to assent to any proposition that looked
like deliverance.

So Peter proposed to Vina, that she should give him certain small
articles, consisting of a cape, etc., which he would carry with him as
memorials, and, in case Concklin or any one else should ever come for
her from him, as an unmistakable sign that all was right, he would send
back, by whoever was to befriend them, the cape, so that she and the
children might not doubt but have faith in the man, when he gave her the
sign, (cape).

Again Peter returned to Philadelphia, and was now willing to accept the
offer of Concklin. Ere long, the opportunity of an interview was had,
and Peter gave Seth a very full description of the country and of his
family, and made known to him, that he had very carefully gone over with
his wife and children the matter of their freedom. This interview
interested Concklin most deeply. If his own wife and children had been
in bondage, scarcely could he have manifested greater sympathy for them.

For the hazardous work before him he was at once prepared to make a
start. True he had two sisters in Philadelphia for whom he had always
cherished the warmest affection, but he conferred not with them on this
momentous mission. For full well did he know that it was not in human
nature for them to acquiesce in this perilous undertaking, though one of
these sisters, Mrs. Supplee, was a most faithful abolitionist.

Having once laid his hand to the plough he was not the man to look
back,--not even to bid his sisters good-bye, but he actually left them
as though he expected to be home to his dinner as usual. What had become
of him during those many weeks of his perilous labors in Alabama to
rescue this family was to none a greater mystery than to his sisters. On
leaving home he simply took two or three small articles in the way of
apparel with one hundred dollars to defray his expenses for a time; this
sum he considered ample to start with. Of course he had very safely
concealed about him Vina's cape and one or two other articles which he
was to use for his identification in meeting her and the children on the
plantation.

His first thought was, on reaching his destination, after becoming
acquainted with the family, being familiar with Southern manners, to
have them all prepared at a given hour for the starting of the steamboat
for Cincinnati, and to join him at the wharf, when he would boldly
assume the part of a slaveholder, and the family naturally that of
slaves, and in this way he hoped to reach Cincinnati direct, before
their owner had fairly discovered their escape.

But alas for Southern irregularity, two or three days' delay after being
advertised to start, was no uncommon circumstance with steamers; hence
this plan was abandoned. What this heroic man endured from severe
struggles and unyielding exertions, in traveling thousands of miles on
water and on foot, hungry and fatigued, rowing his living freight for
seven days and seven nights in a skiff, is hardly to be paralleled in
the annals of the Underground Rail Road.

The following interesting letters penned by the hand of Concklin convey
minutely his last struggles and characteristically represent the
singleness of heart which impelled him to sacrifice his life for the
slave--

EASTPORT, MISS., FEB. 3, 1851.

To Wm. Still:--Our friends in Cincinnati have failed finding anybody to
assist me on my return. Searching the country opposite Paducah, I find
that the whole country fifty miles round is inhabited only by Christian
wolves. It is customary, when a strange negro is seen, for any white man
to seize the negro and convey such negro through and out of the State of
Illinois to Paducah, Ky., and lodge such stranger in Paducah jail, and
there claim such reward as may be offered by the master.

There is no regularity by the steamboats on the Tennessee River. I was
four days getting to Florence from Paducah. Sometimes they are four days
starting, from the time appointed, which alone puts to rest the plan for
returning by steamboat. The distance from the mouth of the river to
Florence, is from between three hundred and five to three hundred and
forty-five miles by the river; by land, two hundred and fifty, or more.

I arrived at the shoe shop on the plantation, one o'clock, Tuesday,
28th. William and two boys were making shoes. I immediately gave the
first signal, anxiously waiting thirty minutes for an opportunity to
give the second and main signal, during which time I was very sociable.
It was rainy and muddy--my pants were rolled up to the knees. I was in
the character of a man seeking employment in this country. End of thirty
minutes gave the second signal.

William appeared unmoved; soon sent out the boys; instantly sociable;
Peter and Levin at the Island; one of the young masters with them; not
safe to undertake to see them till Saturday night, when they would be at
home; appointed a place to see Vina, in an open field, that night; they
to bring me something to eat; our interview only four minutes; I left;
appeared by night; dark and cloudy; at ten o'clock appeared William;
exchanged signals; led me a few rods to where stood Vina; gave her the
signal sent by Peter; our interview ten minutes; she did not call me
"master," nor did she say "sir," by which I knew she had confidence in
me.

Our situation being dangerous, we decided that I meet Peter and Levin on
the bank of the river early dawn of day, Sunday, to establish the laws.
During our interview, William prostrated on his knees, and face to the
ground; arms sprawling; head cocked back, watching for wolves, by which
position a man can see better in the dark. No house to go to safely,
traveled round till morning, eating hoe cake which William had given me
for supper; next day going around to get employment. I thought of
William, who is a Christian preacher, and of the Christian preachers in
Pennsylvania. One watching for wolves by night, to rescue Vina and her
three children from Christian licentiousness; the other standing erect
in open day, seeking the praise of men.

During the four days waiting for the important Sunday morning, I
thoroughly surveyed the rocks and shoals of the river from Florence
seven miles up, where will be my place of departure. General notice was
taken of me as being a stranger, lurking around. Fortunately there are
several small grist mills within ten miles around. No taverns here, as
in the North; any planter's house entertains travelers occasionally.

One night I stayed at a medical gentleman's, who is not a large planter;
another night at an ex-magistrate's house in South Florence--a Virginian
by birth--one of the late census takers; told me that many more persons
cannot read and write than is reported; one fact, amongst many others,
that many persons who do not know the letters of the alphabet, have
learned to write their own names; such are generally reported readers
and writers.

It being customary for a stranger not to leave the house early in the
morning where he has lodged, I was under the necessity of staying out
all night Saturday, to be able to meet Peter and Levin, which was
accomplished in due time. When we approached, I gave my signal first;
immediately they gave theirs. I talked freely. Levin's voice, at first,
evidently trembled. No wonder, for my presence universally attracted
attention by the lords of the land. Our interview was less than one
hour; the laws were written. I to go to Cincinnati to get a rowing boat
and provisions; a first class clipper boat to go with speed. To depart
from the place where the laws were written, on Saturday night of the
first of March. I to meet one of them at the same place Thursday night,
previous to the fourth Saturday from the night previous to the Sunday
when the laws were written. We to go down the Tennessee river to some
place up the Ohio, not yet decided on, in our row boat. Peter and Levin
are good oarsmen. So am I. Telegraph station at Tuscumbia, twelve miles
from the plantation, also at Paducah.

Came from Florence to here Sunday night by steamboat. Eastport is in
Mississippi. Waiting here for a steamboat to go down; paying one dollar
a day for board. Like other taverns here, the wretchedness is
indescribable; no pen, ink, paper or newspaper to be had; only one room
for everybody, except the gambling rooms. It is difficult for me to
write. Vina intends to get a pass for Catharine and herself for the
first Sunday in March.

The bank of the river where I met Peter and Levin is two miles from the
plantation. I have avoided saying I am from Philadelphia. Also avoided
talking about negroes. I never talked so much about milling before. I
consider most of the trouble over, till I arrive in a free State with my
crew, the first week in March; then will I have to be wiser than
Christian serpents, and more cautious than doves. I do not consider it
safe to keep this letter in my possession, yet I dare not put it in the
post-office here; there is so little business in these post-offices that
notice might be taken.

I am evidently watched; everybody knows me to be a miller. I may write
again when I get to Cincinnati, if I should have time. The
ex-magistrate, with whom I stayed in South Florence, held three hours'
talk with me, exclusive of our morning talk. Is a man of good general
information; he was exceedingly inquisitive. "I am from Cincinnati,
formerly from the _State of New York_." I had no opportunity to get
anything to eat from seven o'clock Tuesday morning till six o'clock
Wednesday evening, except the hoe cake, and no sleep.

Florence is the head of navigation for small steamboats. Seven miles,
all the way up to my place of departure, is swift water, and rocky.
Eight hundred miles to Cincinnati. I found all things here as Peter told
me, except the distance of the river. South Florence contains twenty
white families, three warehouses of considerable business, a
post-office, but no school. McKiernon is here waiting for a steamboat to
go to New Orleans, so we are in company.

PRINCETON, GIBSON COUNTY, INDIANA, FEB. 18, 1851.

To Wm. Still:--The plan is to go to Canada, on the Wabash, opposite
Detroit. There are four routes to Canada. One through Illinois,
commencing above and below Alton; one through to North Indiana, and the
Cincinnati route, being the largest route in the United States.

I intended to have gone through Pennsylvania, but the risk going up the
Ohio river has caused me to go to Canada. Steamboat traveling is
universally condemned, though many go in boats, consequently many get
lost. Going in a skiff is new, and is approved of in my case. After I
arrive at the mouth of the Tennessee river, I will go up the Ohio
seventy-five miles, to the mouth of the Wabash, then up the Wabash,
forty-four miles to New Harmony, where I shall go ashore by night, and
go thirteen miles east, to Charles Grier, a farmer, (colored man), who
will entertain us, and next night convey us sixteen miles to David
Stormon, near Princeton, who will take the command, and I be released.

David Stormon estimates the expenses from his house to Canada, at forty
dollars, without which, no sure protection will be given. They might be
instructed concerning the course, and beg their way through without
money. If you wish to do what should be done, you will send me fifty
dollars, in a letter, to Princeton, Gibson county, Inda., so as to
arrive there by the 8th of March. Eight days should be estimated for a
letter to arrive from Philadelphia.

The money to be State Bank of Ohio, or State Bank, or Northern Bank of
Kentucky, or any other Eastern bank. Send no notes larger than twenty
dollars.

Levi Coffin had no money for me. I paid twenty dollars for the skiff. No
money to get back to Philadelphia. It was not understood that I would
have to be at any expense seeking aid.

One half of my time has been used in trying to find persons to assist,
when I may arrive on the Ohio river, in which I have failed, except
Stormon.

Having no letter of introduction to Stormon from any source, on which I
could fully rely, I traveled two hundred miles around, to find out his
stability. I have found many Abolitionists, nearly all who have made
propositions, which themselves would not comply with, and nobody else
would. Already I have traveled over three thousand miles. Two thousand
and four hundred by steamboat, two hundred by railroad, one hundred by
stage, four hundred on foot, forty-eight in a skiff.

I have yet five hundred miles to go to the plantation, to commence
operations. I have been two weeks on the decks of steamboats, three
nights out, two of which I got perfectly wet. If I had had paper money,
as McKim desired, it would have been destroyed. I have not been
entertained gratis at any place except Stormon's. I had one hundred and
twenty-six dollars when I left Philadelphia, one hundred from you,
twenty-six mine.

Telegraphed to station at Evansville, thirty-three miles from Stormon's,
and at Vinclure's, twenty-five miles from Stormon's. The Wabash route is
considered the safest route. No one has ever been lost from Stormon's to
Canada. Some have been lost between Stormon's and the Ohio. The wolves
have never suspected Stormon. Your asking aid in money for a case
properly belonging east of Ohio, is detested. If you have sent money to
Cincinnati, you should recall it. I will have no opportunity to use it.

Seth Concklin, Princeton, Gibson county, Ind.

P.S. First of April, will be about the time Peter's family will arrive
opposite Detroit. You should inform yourself how to find them there. I
may have no opportunity.

I will look promptly for your letter at Princeton, till the 10th of
March, and longer if there should have been any delay by the mails.

In March, as contemplated, Concklin arrived in Indiana, at the place
designated, with Peter's wife and three children, and sent a thrilling
letter to the writer, portraying in the most vivid light his adventurous
flight from the hour they left Alabama until their arrival in Indiana.
In this report he stated, that instead of starting early in the morning,
owing to some unforeseen delay on the part of the family, they did not
reach the designated place till towards day, which greatly exposed them
in passing a certain town which he had hoped to avoid.

But as his brave heart was bent on prosecuting his journey without
further delay, he concluded to start at all hazards, notwithstanding the
dangers he apprehended from passing said town by daylight. For safety he
endeavored to hide his freight by having them all lie flat down on the
bottom of the skiff; covered them with blankets, concealing them from
the effulgent beams of the early morning sun, or rather from the
"Christian Wolves" who might perchance espy him from the shore in
passing the town.

The wind blew fearfully. Concklin was rowing heroically when loud voices
from the shore hailed him, but he was utterly deaf to the sound.
Immediately one or two guns were fired in the direction of the skiff,
but he heeded not this significant call; consequently here ended this
difficulty. He supposed, as the wind was blowing so hard, those on shore
who hailed him must have concluded that he did not hear them and that he
meant no disrespect in treating them with seeming indifference. Whilst
many straits and great dangers had to be passed, this was the greatest
before reaching their destination.

But suffice it to say that the glad tidings which this letter contained
filled the breast of Peter with unutterable delight and his friends and
relations with wonder beyond degree.[A] No fond wife had ever waited
with more longing desire for the return of her husband than Peter had
for this blessed news. All doubts had disappeared, and a well grounded
hope was cherished that within a few short days Peter and his fond wife
and children would be reunited in Freedom on the Canada side, and that
Concklin and the friends would be rejoicing with joy unspeakable over
this great triumph. But alas, before the few days had expired the
subjoined brief paragraph of news was discovered in the morning Ledger.

[Footnote A: In some unaccountable manner this the last letter Concklin
ever penned, perhaps, has been unfortunately lost.]


    RUNAWAY NEGROES CAUGHT.--At Vincennes, Indiana, on Saturday
    last, a white man and four negroes were arrested. The negroes
    belong to B. McKiernon, of South Florence, Alabama, and the man
    who was running them off calls himself John H. Miller. The
    prisoners were taken charge of by the Marshall of
    Evansville.--_April 9th_.


How suddenly these sad tidings turned into mourning and gloom the hope
and joy of Peter and his relatives no pen could possibly describe; at
least the writer will not attempt it here, but will at once introduce a
witness who met the noble Concklin and the panting fugitives in Indiana
and proffered them sympathy and advice. And it may safely be said from a
truer and more devoted friend of the slave they could not have received
counsel.


    EVANSVILLE, INDIANA, MARCH 31st, 1851.

    WM. STILL: _Dear Sir_ ,--On last Tuesday I mailed a letter to
    you, written by Seth Concklin. I presume you have received that
    letter. It gave an account of his rescue of the family of your
    brother. If that is the last news you have had from them, I have
    very painful intelligence for you. They passed on from near
    Princeton, where I saw them and had a lengthy interview with
    them, up north, I think twenty-three miles above Vincennes,
    Ind., where they were seized by a party of men, and lodged in
    jail. Telegraphic dispatches were sent all through the South. I
    have since learned that the Marshall of Evansville received a
    dispatch from Tuscumbia, to look out for them. By some means, he
    and the master, so says report, went to Vincennes and claimed
    the fugitives, chained Mr. Concklin and hurried all off. Mr.
    Concklin wrote to Mr. David Stormon, Princeton, as soon as he
    was cast into prison, to find bail. So soon as we got the letter
    and could get off, two of us were about setting off to render
    all possible aid, when we were told they all had passed, a few
    hours before, through Princeton, Mr. Concklin in chains. What
    kind of process was had, if any, I know not. I immediately came
    down to this place, and learned that they had been put on a boat
    at 3 P.M. I did not arrive until 6. Now all hopes of their
    recovery are gone. No case ever so enlisted my sympathies. I had
    seen Mr. Concklin in Cincinnati. I had given him aid and
    counsel. I happened to see them after they landed in Indiana. I
    heard Peter and Levin tell their tale of suffering, shed tears
    of sorrow for them all; but now, since they have fallen a prey
    to the unmerciful blood-hounds of this state, and have again
    been dragged back to unrelenting bondage, I am entirely
    unmanned. And poor Concklin! I fear for him. When he is dragged
    back to Alabama, I fear they will go far beyond the utmost rigor
    of the law, and vent their savage cruelty upon him. It is with
    pain I have to communicate these things. But you may not hear
    them from him. I could not get to see him or them, as Vincennes
    is about thirty miles from Princeton, where I was when I heard
    of the capture.

    I take pleasure in stating that, according to the letter he
    (Concklin) wrote to Mr. D. Stewart, Mr. Concklin did not abandon
    them, but risked his own liberty to save them. He was not with
    them when they were taken; but went afterwards to take them out
    of jail upon a writ of Habeas Corpus, when they seized him too
    and lodged him in prison.

    I write in much haste. If I can learn any more facts of
    importance, I may write you. If you desire to hear from me
    again, or if you should learn any thing specific from Mr.
    Concklin, be pleased to write me at Cincinnati, where I expect
    to be in a short time. If curious to know your correspondent, I
    may say I was formerly Editor of the "New Concord Free Press,"
    Ohio. I only add that every case of this kind only tends to make
    me abhor my (no!) _this_ country more and more. It is the
    Devil's Government, and God will destroy it.

    Yours for the slave, N.R. JOHNSTON.

    P.S. I broke open this letter to write you some more. The
    foregoing pages were written at night. I expected to mail it
    next morning before leaving Evansville; but the boat for which I
    was waiting came down about three in the morning; so I had to
    hurry on board, bringing the letter along. As it now is I am not
    sorry, for coming down, on my way to St. Louis, as far as
    Paducah, there I learned from a colored man at the wharf that,
    that same day, in the morning, the master and the family of
    fugitives arrived off the boat, and had then gone on their
    journey to Tuscumbia, but that the "white man" (Mr. Concklin)
    had "got away from them," about twelve miles up the river. It
    seems he got off the boat some way, near or at Smithland, Ky., a
    town at the mouth of the Cumberland River. I presume the report
    is true, and hope he will finally escape, though I was also told
    that they were in pursuit of him. Would that the others had also
    escaped. Peter and Levin could have done so, I think, if they
    had had resolution. One of them rode a horse, he not tied
    either, behind the coach in which the others were. He followed
    apparently "contented and happy." From report, they told their
    master, and even their pursuers, before the master came, that
    Concklin had decoyed them away, they coming unwillingly. I write
    on a very unsteady boat.

    Yours, N.R. JOHNSTON.


A report found its way into the papers to the effect that "Miller," the
white man arrested in connection with the capture of the family, was
found drowned, with his hands and feet in chains and his skull
fractured. It proved, as his friends feared, to be Seth Concklin. And in
irons, upon the river bank, there is no doubt he was buried.

In this dreadful hour one sad duty still remained to be performed. Up to
this moment the two sisters were totally ignorant of their brother's
whereabouts. Not the first whisper of his death had reached them. But
they must now be made acquainted with all the facts in the case.
Accordingly an interview was arranged for a meeting, and the duty of
conveying this painful intelligence to one of the sisters, Mrs. Supplee,
devolved upon Mr. McKim. And most tenderly and considerately did he
perform his mournful task.

Although a woman of nerve, and a true friend to the slave, an earnest
worker and a liberal giver in the Female Anti-Slavery Society, for a
time she was overwhelmed by the intelligence of her brother's death. As
soon as possible, however, through very great effort, she controlled her
emotions, and calmly expressed herself as being fully resigned to the
awful event. Not a word of complaint had she to make because she had not
been apprised of his movements; but said repeatedly, that, had she known
ever so much of his intentions, she would have been totally powerless in
opposing him if she had felt so disposed, and as an illustration of the
true character of the man, from his boyhood up to the day he died for
his fellow-man, she related his eventful career, and recalled a number
of instances of his heroic and daring deeds for others, sacrificing his
time and often periling his life in the cause of those who he considered
were suffering gross wrongs and oppression. Hence, she concluded, that
it was only natural for him in this case to have taken the steps he did.
Now and then overflowing tears would obstruct this deeply thrilling and
most remarkable story she was telling of her brother, but her memory
seemed quickened by the sadness of the occasion, and she was enabled to
recall vividly the chief events connected with his past history. Thus
his agency in this movement, which cost him his life, could readily
enough be accounted for, and the individuals who listened attentively to
the story were prepared to fully appreciate his character, for, prior to
offering his services in this mission, he had been a stranger to them.

The following extract, taken from a letter of a subsequent date, in
addition to the above letter, throws still further light upon the
heart-rending affair, and shows Mr. Johnston's deep sympathy with the
sufferers and the oppressed generally--



EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM REV. N.R. JOHNSTON.



    My heart bleeds when I think of those poor, hunted and
    heart-broken fugitives, though a most interesting family, taken
    back to bondage ten-fold worse than Egyptian. And then poor
    Concklin! How my heart expanded in love to him, as he told me
    his adventures, his trials, his toils, his fears and his hopes!
    After hearing all, and then seeing and communing with the
    family, now joyful in hopes of soon seeing their husband and
    father in the land of freedom; now in terror lest the human
    blood-hounds should be at their heels, I felt as though I could
    lay down my life in the cause of the oppressed. In that hour or
    two of intercourse with Peter's family, my heart warmed with
    love to them. I never saw more interesting young men. They would
    make Remonds or Douglasses, if they had the same opportunities.

    While I was with them, I was elated with joy at their escape,
    and yet, when I heard their tale of woe, especially that of the
    mother, I could not suppress tears of deepest emotion.

    My joy was short-lived. Soon I heard of their capture. The
    telegraph had been the means of their being claimed. I could
    have torn down all the telegraph wires in the land. It was a
    strange dispensation of Providence.

    On Saturday the sad news of their capture came to my ears. We
    had resolved to go to their aid on Monday, as the trial was set
    for Thursday. On Sabbath, I spoke from Psalm xii. 5. "For the
    oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I
    arise," saith the Lord: "I will set him in safety from him that
    puffeth at (from them that would enslave) him." When on Monday
    morning I learned that the fugitives had passed through the
    place on Sabbath, and Concklin in chains, probably at the very
    time I was speaking on the subject referred to, my heart sank
    within me. And even yet, I cannot but exclaim, when I think of
    it--O, Father! how long ere Thou wilt arise to avenge the wrongs
    of the poor slave! Indeed, my dear brother, His ways are very
    mysterious. We have the consolation, however, to know that all
    is for the best. Our Redeemer does all things well. When He hung
    upon the cross, His poor broken hearted disciples could not
    understand the providence; it was a dark time to them; and yet
    that was an event that was fraught with more joy to the world
    than any that has occurred or could occur. Let us stand at our
    post and wait God's time. Let us have on the whole armor of God,
    and fight for the right, knowing, that though we may fall in
    battle, the victory will be ours, sooner or later.


           *       *       *       *       *


    May God lead you into all truth, and sustain you in your labors,
    and fulfill your prayers and hopes. Adieu.

    N.R. JOHNSTON.




LETTERS FROM LEVI COFFIN.


The following letters on the subject were received from the untiring and
devoted friend of the slave, Levi Coffin, who for many years had
occupied in Cincinnati a similar position to that of Thomas Garrett in
Delaware, a sentinel and watchman commissioned of God to succor the
fleeing bondman--


    CINCINNATI, 4TH MO., 10TH, 1851.

    FRIEND WM. STILL:--We have sorrowful news from our friend
    Concklin, through the papers and otherwise. I received a letter
    a few days ago from a friend near Princeton, Ind., stating that
    Concklin and the four slaves are in prison in Vincennes, and
    that their trial would come on in a few days. He states that
    they rowed seven days and nights in the skiff, and got safe to
    Harmony, Ind., on the Wabash river, thence to Princeton, and
    were conveyed to Vincennes by friends, where they were taken.
    The papers state, that they were all given up to the Marshal of
    Evansville, Indiana.

    We have telegraphed to different points, to try to get some
    information concerning them, but failed. The last information is
    published in the _Times_ of yesterday, though quite incorrect in
    the particulars of the case. Inclosed is the slip containing it.
    I fear all is over in regard to the freedom of the slaves. If
    the last account be true, we have some hope that Concklin will
    escape from those bloody tyrants. I cannot describe my feelings
    on hearing this sad intelligence. I feel ashamed to own my
    country. Oh! what shall I say. Surely a God of justice will
    avenge the wrongs of the oppressed.

    Thine for the poor slave,

    LEVI COFFIN.

    N.B.--If thou hast any information, please write me forthwith.





    CINCINNATI, 5TH MO., 11TH, 1851.

    WM. STILL:--_Dear Friend_--Thy letter of 1st inst., came duly to
    hand, but not being able to give any further information
    concerning our friend, Concklin, I thought best to wait a little
    before I wrote, still hoping to learn something more definite
    concerning him.

    We that became acquainted with Seth Concklin and his hazardous
    enterprises (here at Cincinnati), who were very few, have felt
    intense and inexpressible anxiety about them. And particularly
    about poor Seth, since we heard of his falling into the hands of
    the tyrants. I fear that he has fallen a victim to their inhuman
    thirst for blood.

    I seriously doubt the rumor, that he had made his escape. I fear
    that he was sacrificed.

    Language would fail to express my feelings; the intense and deep
    anxiety I felt about them for weeks before I heard of their
    capture in Indiana, and then it seemed too much to bear. O! my
    heart almost bleeds when I think of it. The hopes of the dear
    family all blasted by the wretched blood-hounds in human shape.
    And poor Seth, after all his toil, and dangerous, shrewd and
    wise management, and almost unheard of adventures, the many
    narrow and almost miraculous escapes. Then to be given up to
    Indianians, to these fiendish tyrants, to be sacrificed. O!
    Shame, Shame!!

    My heart aches, my eyes fill with tears, I cannot write more. I
    cannot dwell longer on this painful subject now. If you get any
    intelligence, please inform me. Friend N.R. Johnston, who took
    so much interest in them, and saw them just before they were
    taken, has just returned to the city. He is a minister of the
    Covenanter order. He is truly a lovely man, and his heart is
    full of the milk of humanity; one of our best Anti-Slavery
    spirits. I spent last evening with him. He related the whole
    story to me as he had it from friend Concklin and the mother and
    children, and then the story of their capture. We wept together.
    He found thy letter when he got here.

    He said he would write the whole history to thee in a few days,
    as far as he could. He can tell it much better than I can.

    Concklin left his carpet sack and clothes here with me, except a
    shirt or two he took with him. What shall I do with them? For if
    we do not hear from him soon, we must conclude that he is lost,
    and the report of his escape all a hoax.

    Truly thy friend,

    LEVI COFFIN.


Stunning and discouraging as this horrible ending was to all concerned,
and serious as the matter looked in the eyes of Peter's friends with
regard to Peter's family, he could not for a moment abandon the idea of
rescuing them from the jaws of the destroyer. But most formidable
difficulties stood in the way of opening correspondence with reliable
persons in Alabama. Indeed it seemed impossible to find a merchant,
lawyer, doctor, planter or minister, who was not too completely
interlinked with slavery to be relied upon to manage a negotiation of
this nature. Whilst waiting and hoping for something favorable to turn
up, the subjoined letter from the owner of Peter's family was received
and is here inserted precisely as it was written, spelled and
punctuated--

WM. STILL'S ANSWER.



    PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 16th, 1851.

    To B. McKIERNON, ESQ.: _Sir_--I have received your letter from
    South Florence, Ala., under date of the 6th inst. To say that it
    took me by surprise, as well as afforded me pleasure, for which
    I feel to be very much indebted to you, is no more than true. In
    regard to your informants of myself--Mr. Thornton, of Ala., and
    Mr. Samuel Lewis, of Cincinnati--to them both I am a stranger.
    However, I am the brother of Peter, referred to, and with the
    fact of his having a wife and three children in your service I
    am also familiar. This brother, Peter, I have only had the
    pleasure of knowing for the brief space of one year and thirteen
    days, although he is now past forty and I twenty-nine years of
    age. Time will not allow me at present, or I should give you a
    detailed account of how Peter became a slave, the forty long
    years which intervened between the time he was kidnapped, when a
    boy, being only six years of age, and his arrival in this city,
    from Alabama, one year and fourteen days ago, when he was
    re-united to his mother, five brothers and three sisters.

    None but a father's heart can fathom the anguish and sorrows
    felt by Peter during the many vicissitudes through which he has
    passed. He looked back to his boyhood and saw himself snatched
    from the tender embraces of his parents and home to be made a
    slave for life.

    During all his prime days he was in the faithful and constant
    service of those who had no just claim upon him. In the
    meanwhile he married a wife, who bore him eleven children, the
    greater part of whom were emancipated from the troubles of life
    by death, and three only survived. To them and his wife he was
    devoted. Indeed I have never seen attachment between parents and
    children, or husband and wife, more entire than was manifested
    in the case of Peter.

    Through these many years of servitude, Peter was sold and
    resold, from one State to another, from one owner to another,
    till he reached the forty-ninth year of his age, when, in a good
    Providence, through the kindness of a friend and the sweat of
    his brow, he regained the God-given blessings of liberty. He
    eagerly sought his parents and home with all possible speed and
    pains, when, to his heart's joy, he found his relatives.

    Your present humble correspondent is the youngest of Peter's
    brothers, and the first one of the family he saw after arriving
    in this part of the country. I think you could not fail to be
    interested in hearing how we became known to each other, and the
    proof of our being brothers, etc., all of which I should be most
    glad to relate, but time will not permit me to do so. The news
    of this wonderful occurrence, of Peter finding his kindred, was
    published quite extensively, shortly afterwards, in various
    newspapers, in this quarter, which may account for the fact of
    "Miller's" knowledge of the whereabouts of the "fugitives." Let
    me say, it is my firm conviction that no one had any hand in
    persuading "Miller" to go down from Cincinnati, or any other
    place, after the family. As glad as I should be, and as much as
    I would do for the liberation of Peter's family (now no longer
    young), and his three "likely" children, in whom he prides
    himself--how much, if you are a father, you can imagine; yet I
    would not, and could not, think of persuading any friend to
    peril his life, as would be the case, in an errand of that kind.

    As regards the price fixed upon by you for the family, I must
    say I do not think it possible to raise half that amount, though
    Peter authorized me to say he would give you twenty-five hundred
    for them. Probably he is not as well aware as I am, how
    difficult it is to raise so large a sum of money from the
    public. The applications for such objects are so frequent among
    us in the North, and have always been so liberally met, that it
    is no wonder if many get tired of being called upon. To be sure
    some of us brothers own some property, but no great amount;
    certainly not enough to enable us to bear so great a burden.
    Mother owns a small farm in New Jersey, on which she has lived
    for nearly forty years, from which she derives her support in
    her old age. This small farm contains between forty and fifty
    acres, and is the fruit of my father's toil. Two of my brothers
    own small places also, but they have young families, and
    consequently consume nearly as much as they make, with the
    exception of adding some improvements to their places.

    For my own part, I am employed as a clerk for a living, but my
    salary is quite too limited to enable me to contribute any great
    amount towards so large a sum as is demanded. Thus you see how
    we are situated financially. We have plenty of friends, but
    little money. Now, sir, allow me to make an appeal to your
    humanity, although we are aware of your power to hold as
    property those poor slaves, mother, daughter and two sons,--that
    in no part of the United States could they escape and be secure
    from your claim--nevertheless, would your understanding, your
    heart, or your conscience reprove you, should you restore to
    them, without price, that dear freedom, which is theirs by right
    of nature, or would you not feel a satisfaction in so doing
    which all the wealth of the world could not equal? At all
    events, could you not so reduce the price as to place it in the
    power of Peter's relatives and friends to raise the means for
    their purchase? At first, I doubt not, but that you will think
    my appeal very unreasonable; but, sir, serious reflection will
    decide, whether the money demanded by you, after all, will be of
    as great a benefit to you, as the satisfaction you would find in
    bestowing so great a favor upon those whose entire happiness in
    this life depends mainly upon your decision in the matter. If
    the entire family cannot be purchased or freed, what can Vina
    and her daughter be purchased for? Hoping, sir, to hear from
    you, at your earliest convenience, I subscribe myself,

    Your obedient servant, WM. STILL.

    To B. McKiernon, Esq.


No reply to this letter was ever received from McKiernon. The cause of
his reticence can be as well conjectured by the reader as the writer.

Time will not admit of further details kindred to this narrative. The
life, struggles, and success of Peter and his family were ably brought
before the public in the "Kidnapped and the Ransomed," being the
personal recollections of Peter Still and his wife "Vina," after forty
years of slavery, by Mrs. Kate E.R. Pickard; with an introduction by
Rev. Samuel J. May, and an appendix by William H. Furness, D.D., in
1856. But, of course it was not prudent or safe, in the days of Slavery,
to publish such facts as are now brought to light; all such had to be
kept concealed in the breasts of the fugitives and their friends.

THE SEPARATION.


With regard to Peter's separation from his mother, when a little boy, in
few words, the facts were these: His parents, Levin and Sidney, were
both slaves on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. "I will die before I
submit to the yoke," was the declaration of his father to his young
master before either was twenty-one years of age. Consequently he was
allowed to buy himself at a very low figure, and he paid the required
sum and obtained his "free papers" when quite a young man--the young
wife and mother remaining in slavery under Saunders Griffin, as also her
children, the latter having increased to the number of four, two little
boys and two little girls. But to escape from chains, stripes, and
bondage, she took her four little children and fled to a place near
Greenwich, New Jersey. Not a great while, however, did she remain there
in a state of freedom before the slave-hunters pursued her, and one
night they pounced upon the whole family, and, without judge or jury,
hurried them all back to slavery. Whether this was kidnapping or not is
for the reader to decide for himself.

Safe back in the hands of her owner, to prevent her from escaping a
second time, every night for about three months she was cautiously "kept
locked up in the garret," until, as they supposed, she was fully "cured
of the desire to do so again." But she was incurable. She had been a
witness to the fact that her own father's brains had been blown out by
the discharge of a heavily loaded gun, deliberately aimed at his head by
his drunken master. She only needed half a chance to make still greater
struggles than ever for freedom.

She had great faith in God, and found much solace in singing some of the
good old Methodist tunes, by day and night. Her owner, observing this
apparently tranquil state of mind, indicating that she "seemed better
contented than ever," concluded that it was safe to let the garret door
remain unlocked at night. Not many weeks were allowed to pass before she
resolved to again make a bold strike for freedom. This time she had to
leave the two little boys, Levin and Peter, behind.

On the night she started she went to the bed where they were sleeping,
kissed them, and, consigning them into the hands of God, bade her mother
good-bye, and with her two little girls wended her way again to
Burlington County, New Jersey, but to a different neighborhood from that
where she had been seized. She changed her name to Charity, and
succeeded in again joining her husband, but, alas, with the
heart-breaking thought that she had been compelled to leave her two
little boys in slavery and one of the little girls on the road for the
father to go back after. Thus she began life in freedom anew.

Levin and Peter, eight and six years of age respectively, were now left
at the mercy of the enraged owner, and were soon hurried off to a
Southern market and sold, while their mother, for whom they were daily
weeping, was they knew not where. They were too young to know that they
were slaves, or to understand the nature of the afflicting separation.
Sixteen years before Peter's return, his older brother (Levin) died a
slave in the State of Alabama, and was buried by his surviving brother,
Peter.

No idea other than that they had been "kidnapped" from their mother ever
entered their minds; nor had they any knowledge of the State from whence
they supposed they had been taken, the last names of their mother and
father, or where they were born. On the other hand, the mother was aware
that the safety of herself and her rescued children depended on keeping
the whole transaction a strict family secret. During the forty years of
separation, except two or three Quaker friends, including the devoted
friend of the slave, Benjamin Lundy, it is doubtful whether any other
individuals were let into the secret of her slave life. And when the
account given of Peter's return, etc., was published in 1850, it led
some of the family to apprehend serious danger from the partial
revelation of the early condition of the mother, especially as it was
about the time that the Fugitive Slave law was passed.

Hence, the author of "The Kidnapped and the Ransomed" was compelled to
omit these dangerous facts, and had to confine herself strictly to the
"personal recollections of Peter Still" with regard to his being
"kidnapped." Likewise, in the sketch of Seth Concklin's eventful life,
written by Dr. W.H. Furness, for similar reasons he felt obliged to make
but bare reference to his wonderful agency in relation to Peter's
family, although he was fully aware of all the facts in the case.



UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD LETTERS.


Here are introduced a few out of a very large number of interesting
letters, designed for other parts of the book as occasion may require.
All letters will be given precisely as they were written by their
respective authors, so that there may be no apparent room for charging
the writer with partial colorings in any instance. Indeed, the
originals, however ungrammatically written or erroneously spelt, in
their native simplicity possess such beauty and force as corrections and
additions could not possibly enhance--



LETTER FROM THOMAS GARRETT (U.G.R.R. DEPOT).


WILMINGTON, 3mo. 23d, 1856.

DEAR FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--Since I wrote thee this morning informing
thee of the safe arrival of the Eight from Norfolk, Harry Craige has
informed me, that he has a man from Delaware that he proposes to take
along, who arrived since noon. He will take the man, woman and two
children from here with him, and the four men will get in at Marcus
Hook. Thee may take Harry Craige by the hand as a brother, true to the
cause; he is one of our most efficient aids on the Rail Road, and worthy
of full confidence. May they all be favored to get on safe. The woman
and three children are no common stock. I assure thee finer specimens of
humanity are seldom met with. I hope herself and children may be enabled
to find her husband, who has been absent some years, and the rest of
their days be happy together.

I am, as ever, thy friend,

THOS. GARRETT.



LETTER FROM MISS G.A. LEWIS (U.G.R.R. DEPOT).


KIMBERTON, October 28th, 1855.

ESTEEMED FRIEND;--This evening a company of eleven friends reached here,
having left their homes on the night of the 26th inst. They came into
Wilmington, about ten o'clock on the morning of the 27th, and left
there, in the town, their two carriages, drawn by two horses. They went
to Thomas Garrett's by open day-light and from thence were sent hastily
onward for fear of pursuit. They reached Longwood meeting-house in the
evening, at which place a Fair Circle had convened, and stayed a while
in the meeting, then, after remaining all night with one of the Kennet
friends, they were brought to Downingtown early in the morning, and from
thence, by daylight, to within a short distance of this place.

They come from New Chestertown, within five miles of the place from
which the nine lately forwarded came, and left behind them a colored
woman who knew of their intended flight and of their intention of
passing through Wilmington and leaving their horses and carriages there.

I have been thus particular in my statement, because the case seems to
us one of unusual danger. We have separated the company for the present,
sending a mother and five children, two of them quite small, in one
direction, and a husband and wife and three lads in another, until I
could write to you and get advice if you have any to give, as to the
best method of forwarding them, and assistance pecuniarily, in getting
them to Canada. The mother and children we have sent off of the usual
route, and to a place where I do not think they can remain many days.

We shall await hearing from you. H. Kimber will be in the city on third
day, the 30th, and any thing left at 408 Green Street directed to his
care, will meet with prompt attention.

Please give me again the direction of Hiram Wilson and the friend in
Elmira, Mr. Jones, I think. If you have heard from any of the nine since
their safe arrival, please let us know when you write.

Very Respectfully,

G.A. LEWIS.

_2d day morning, 29th_.--The person who took the husband and wife and
three lads to E.F. Pennypecker, and Peart, has returned and reports that
L. Peart sent three on to Norristown. We fear that there they will fall
into the hands of an ignorant colored man Daniel Ross, and that he may
not understand the necessity of caution. Will you please write to some
careful person there? The woman and children detained in this
neighborhood are a very helpless set. Our plan was to assist them as
much as possible, and when we get things into the proper train for
sending them on, to get the assistance of the husband and wife, who have
no children, but are uncle and aunt to the woman with five, in taking
with them one of the younger children, leaving fewer for the mother. Of
the lads, or young men, there is also one whom we thought capable of
accompanying one of the older girls--one to whom he is paying attention,
they told us. Would it not be the best way to get those in Norristown
under your own care? It seems to me their being sent on could then be
better arranged. This, however, is only a suggestion,

Hastily yours,

G.A. LEWIS.



LETTER FROM E.L. STEVENS, ESQ. _(The reader will interpret for
himself_.)


WASHINGTON, D.C., July 11th, 1858.

MY DEAR SIR:--Susan Bell left here yesterday with the child of her
relative, and since leaving I have thought, perhaps, you had not the
address of the gentleman in Syracuse where the child is to be taken for
medical treatment, etc. His name is Dr. H.B. Wilbur. A woman living with
him is a most excellent nurse and will take a deep interest in the
child, which, no doubt, will under Providence be the means of its
complete restoration to health. Be kind enough to inform me whether
Susan is with you, and if she is give her the proper direction. _Ten
packages_ were sent to your address last evening, one of them belongs to
Susan, and she had better remain with you till she gets it, as it may
not have come to hand. Susan thought she would go to Harrisburg when she
left here and stay over Sunday, if so, she would not get to Philadelphia
till Monday or Tuesday. Please acknowledge the receipt of this, and
inform me of her arrival, also when the packages came safe to hand,
inform me especially if Susan's came safely.

Truly Yours,

E.L. STEVENS.



LETTER FROM S.H. GAY, ESQ., EX-EDITOR OF THE ANTI-SLAVERY STANDARD AND
NEW YORK TRIBUNE.


FRIEND STILL:--The two women, Laura and Lizzy, arrived this morning. I
shall forward them to Syracuse this afternoon.

The two men came safely yesterday, but went to Gibbs'. He has friends on
board the boat who are on the lookout for fugitives, and send them, when
found, to his house. Those whom you wish to be particularly under my
charge, must have careful directions to this office.

There is now no other sure place, but the office, or Gibbs', that I
could advise you to send such persons. Those to me, therefore, must come
in office hours. In a few days, however, Napoleon will have a room down
town, and at odd times they can be sent there. I am not willing to put
any more with the family where I have hitherto sometimes sent them.

When it is possible I wish you would advise me two days before a
shipment of your intention, as Napoleon is not always on hand to look
out for them at short notice. In special cases you might advise me by
Telegraph, thus: "One M. (or one F.) this morning. W.S." By which I
shall understand that one Male, or one Female, as the case may be, has
left Phila. by the 6 _o'clock train_--one or more, also, as the case may
be.

Aug. 17th, 1855.

Truly Yours, S.H. GAY.



LETTER FROM JOHN H. HILL, A FUGITIVE, APPEALING IN BEHALF OF A POOR
SLAVE IN PETERSBURG, VA.


HAMILTON, Sept. 15th, 1856.

DEAR FRIEND STILL:--I write to inform you that Miss Mary Wever arrived
safe in this city. You may imagine the happiness manifested on the part
of the two lovers, Mr. H. and Miss W. I think they will be married as
soon as they can get ready. I presume Mrs. Hill will commence to make up
the articles to-morrow. Kind Sir, as all of us is concerned about the
welfare of our enslaved brethren at the South, particularly our friends,
we appeal to your sympathy to do whatever is in your power to save poor
Willis Johnson from the hands of his cruel master. It is not for me to
tell you of his case, because Miss Wever has related the matter fully to
you. All I wish to say is this, I wish you to write to my uncle, at
Petersburg, by our friend, the Capt. Tell my uncle to go to Richmond and
ask my mother whereabouts this man is. The best for him is to make his
way to Petersburg; that is, if you can get the Capt. to bring him. He
have not much money. But I hope the friends of humanity will not
withhold their aid on the account of money. However we will raise all
the money that is wanting to pay for his safe delivery. You will please
communicate this to the friends as soon as possible.

Yours truly,

JOHN H. HILL.



LETTER FROM J. BIGELOW, ESQ.


WASHINGTON, D.C., June 22d, 1854.

MR. WILLIAM STILL:--_Sir_--I have just received a letter from my friend,
Wm. Wright, of York Sulphur Springs, Pa., in which he says, that by
writing to you, I may get some information about the transportation of
some _property_ from this neighborhood to your city or vicinity.

A person who signs himself Wm. Penn, lately wrote to Mr. Wright, saying
he would pay $300 to have this service performed. It is for the
conveyance of _only one_ SMALL package; but it has been discovered
since, that the removal cannot be so safely effected without taking _two
larger_ packages with it. I understand that the _three_ are to be
brought to this city and stored in safety, as soon as the forwarding
merchant in Philadelphia shall say he is ready to send on. The storage,
etc., here, will cost a trifle, but the $300 will be promptly paid for
the whole service. I think Mr. Wright's daughter, Hannah, has also seen
you. I am also known to Prof. C.D. Cleveland, of your city. If you
answer this promptly, you will soon hear from Wm. Penn himself.

Very truly yours,

J. BIGELOW.



LETTER FROM HAM & EGGS, SLAVE (U.G.R.R. AG'T).


PETERSBURG, VA., Oct. 17th, 1860.

MR. W. STILL:--_Dear Sir_--I am happy to think, that the time has come
when we no doubt can open our correspondence with one another again.
Also I am in hopes, that these few lines may find you and family well
and in the enjoyment of good health, as it leaves me and family the
same. I want you to know, that I feel as much determined to work in this
glorious cause, as ever I did in all of my life, and I have some very
good hams on hand that I would like very much for you to have. I have
nothing of interest to write about just now, only that the politics of
the day is in a high rage, and I don't know of the result, therefore, I
want you to be one of those wide-a-wakes as is mentioned from your
section of country now-a-days, &c. Also, if you wish to write to me, Mr.
J. Brown will inform you how to direct a letter to me.

No more at present, until I hear from you; but I want you to be a
wide-a-wake.

Yours in haste,

HAM & EGGS.



LETTER FROM REV H. WILSON (U.G.R.R. AG'T).


ST. CATHARINE, C.W., July 2d, 1855.

MY DEAR FRIEND, WM. STILL:--Mr. Elias Jasper and Miss Lucy Bell having
arrived here safely on Saturday last, and found their "companions in
tribulation," who had arrived before them, I am induced to write and let
you know the fact. They are a cheerful, happy company, and very grateful
for their freedom. I have done the best I could for their comfort, but
they are about to proceed across the lake to Toronto, thinking they can
do better there than here, which is not unlikely. They all remember you
as their friend and benefactor, and return to you their sincere thanks.
My means of support are so scanty, that I am obliged to write without
paying postage, or not write at all. I hope you are not moneyless, as I
am. In attending to the wants of numerous strangers, I am much of the
time perplexed from lack of means; but send on as many as you can and I
will divide with them to the last crumb.

Yours truly,

HIRAM WILSON.

LETTER FROM JOS. C. BUSTILL (U.G.R.R. DEPOT).


HARRISBURG, March 24, '56.

FRIEND STILL:--I suppose ere this you have seen those five large and
three small packages I sent by way of Reading, consisting of three men
and women and children. They arrived here this morning at 8-1/2 o'clock
and left twenty minutes past three. You will please send me any
information likely to prove interesting in relation to them.

Lately we have formed a Society here, called the Fugitive Aid Society.
This is our first case, and I hope it will prove entirely successful.

When you write, please inform me what signs or symbols you make use of
in your despatches, and any other information in relation to operations
of the Underground Rail Road.

Our reason for sending by the Reading Road, was to gain time; it is
expected the owners will be in town this afternoon, and by this Road we
gained five hours' time, which is a matter of much importance, and we
may have occasion to use it sometimes in future. In great haste,

Yours with great respect,

my uncle a few lines in regard to the bundle that is for John H. Hill,
who lives in Hamilton, C.W. Sir, if this should reach you, be assured
that it comes from the same poor individual that you have heard of
before; the person who was so unlucky, and deceived also. If you write,
address your letter John M. Hill, care of Box No. 250. I am speaking of
a person who lives in P.va. I hope, sir, you will understand this is
from a poor individual.



LETTER FROM G.S. NELSON (U.G.R.R. DEPOT).


MR. STILL:--_My Dear Sir_--I suppose you are somewhat uneasy because the
goods did not come safe to hand on Monday evening, as you
expected--consigned from Harrisburg to you. The train only was from
Harrisburg to Reading, and as it happened, the goods had to stay all
night with us, and as some excitement exists here about goods of the
kind, we thought it expedient and wise to detain them until we could
hear from you. There are two small boxes and two large ones; we have
them all secure; what had better be done? Let us know. Also, as we can
learn, there are three more boxes still in Harrisburg. Answer your
communication at Harrisburg. Also, fail not to answer this by the return
of mail, as things are rather critical, and you will oblige us.

G.S. NELSON.

_Reading, May 27, '57_.

We knew not that these goods were to come, consequently we were all
taken by surprise. When you answer, use the word, goods. The reason of
the excitement, is: some three weeks ago a big box was consigned to us
by J. Bustill, of Harrisburg. We received it, and forwarded it on to J.
Jones, Elmira, and the next day they were on the fresh hunt of said box;
it got safe to Elmira, as I have had a letter from Jones, and all is
safe.

LETTER FROM "WM. PENN" (OF THE BAR).


WASHINGTON, D.C., Dec. 9th, 1856.

DEAR SIR:--I was unavoidably prevented yesterday, from replying to yours
of 6th instant, and although I have made inquiries, I am unable
_to-day_, to answer your questions satisfactorily. Although I know some
of the residents of Loudon county, and have often visited there, still I
have not practiced much in the Courts of that county. There are several
of my acquaintances here, who have lived in that county, and _possibly_,
through my assistance, your commissions might be executed. If a better
way shall not suggest itself to you, and you see fit to give me the
_facts_ in the case, I can better judge of my ability to help you; _but
I know not the man resident there, whom I would trust with an important
suit_. I think it is now some four or five weeks since, that some
packages left this vicinity, said to be from fifteen to twenty in
number, and as I suppose, went through your hands. It was at a time of
uncommon vigilance here, and to me it was a matter of extreme wonder,
_how and through whom_, such a work was accomplished. Can you tell me?
It is _needful_ that I should know! Not for curiosity merely, but for
the good of others. An enclosed slip contains the _marks_ of one of the
packages, which you will read and then _immediately burn_.

If you can give me any light that will _benefit others_, I am sure you
will do so.

A traveler here, _very reliable_, and who knows his business, has
determined not to leave home again till spring, at least not without
extraordinary temptations.

I think, however, he or others, might be tempted to travel in Virginia.

Yours,

WM. P.



LETTER FROM MISS THEODOCIA GILBERT.



    SKANEATELES (GLEN HAVEN) CHUY., 1851.

    WILLIAM STILL:--_Dear Friend and Brother_--A thousand thanks for
    your good, generous letter!

    It was so kind of you to have in mind my intense interest and
    anxiety in the success and fate of poor Concklin! That he
    desired and intended to hazard an attempt of the kind, I well
    understood; but what particular one, or that he had actually
    embarked in the enterprise, I had not been able to learn.

    His memory will ever be among the sacredly cherished with me. He
    certainly displayed more real disinterestedness, more earnest,
    unassuming devotedness, than those who _claim_ to be the
    sincerest friends of the slave can often boast. What more
    _Saviour_-like than the _willing_ sacrifice he has rendered!

    Never shall I forget that night of our extremest peril (as we
    supposed), when he came and so heartily proffered his services
    at the hazard of his liberty, of life even, in behalf of William
    L. Chaplin.

    _Such_ generosity! at _such_ a moment! The emotions it awakened
    no words can bespeak! They are to be sought but in the inner
    chambers of one's own soul! He as earnestly devised the means,
    as calmly counted the cost, and as unshrinkingly turned him to
    the task, as if it were his own freedom he would have won.

    Through his homely features, and humble garb, the intrepidity of
    soul came out in all its lustre! Heroism, in its native majesty,
    _commanded_ one's admiration and love!

    Most truly can I enter into your sorrows, and painfully
    appreciate the pang of disappointment which must have followed
    this sad intelligence. But so inadequate are words to the
    consoling of such griefs, it were almost cruel to attempt to
    syllable one's sympathies.

    I cannot bear to believe, that Concklin has been actually
    murdered, and yet I hardly dare hope it is otherwise.

    And the poor slaves, for whom he periled so much, into what
    depths of hopelessness and woe are they again plunged! But the
    deeper and blacker for the loss of their dearly sought and
    new-found freedom. How long must wrongs like these go
    unredressed? "_How long, O God, how long_?"

WILLIAM PEEL, ALIAS WILLIAM BOX PEEL JONES.


ARRIVED PER ERRICSON LINE OF STEAMERS, WRAPPED IN STRAW AND BOXED UP,


APRIL, 1859.


William is twenty-five years of age, unmistakably colored, good-looking,
rather under the medium size, and of pleasing manners. William had
himself boxed up by a near relative and forwarded by the Erricson line
of steamers. He gave the slip to Robert H. Carr, his owner (a grocer and
commission merchant), after this wise, and for the following reasons:
For some time previous his master had been selling off his slaves every
now and then, the same as other groceries, and this admonished William
that he was liable to be in the market any day; consequently, he
preferred the box to the auction-block.

He did not complain of having been treated very badly by Carr, but felt
that no man was safe while owned by another. In fact, he "hated the very
name of slaveholder." The limit of the box not admitting of
straightening himself out he was taken with the cramp on the road,
suffered indescribable misery, and had his faith taxed to the
utmost,--indeed was brought to the very verge of "screaming aloud" ere
relief came. However, he controlled himself, though only for a short
season, for before a great while an excessive faintness came over him.
Here nature became quite exhausted. He thought he must "die;" but his
time had not yet come. After a severe struggle he revived, but only to
encounter a third ordeal no less painful than the one through which he
had just passed. Next a very "cold chill" came over him, which seemed
almost to freeze the very blood in his veins and gave him intense agony,
from which he only found relief on awaking, having actually fallen
asleep in that condition. Finally, however, he arrived at Philadelphia,
on a steamer, Sabbath morning. A devoted friend of his, expecting him,
engaged a carriage and repaired to the wharf for the box. The bill of
lading and the receipt he had with him, and likewise knew where the box
was located on the boat. Although he well knew freight was not usually
delivered on Sunday, yet his deep solicitude for the safety of his
friend determined him to do all that lay in his power to rescue him from
his perilous situation. Handing his bill of lading to the proper officer
of the boat, he asked if he could get the freight that it called for.
The officer looked at the bill and said, "No, we do not deliver freight
on Sunday;" but, noticing the anxiety of the man, he asked him if he
would know it if he were to see it. Slowly--fearing that too much
interest manifested might excite suspicion--he replied: "I think I
should." Deliberately looking around amongst all the "freight," he
discovered the box, and said, "I think that is it there." Said officer
stepped to it, looked at the directions on it, then at the bill of
lading, and said, "That is right, take it along." Here the interest in
these two bosoms was thrilling in the highest degree. But the size of
the box was too large for the carriage, and the driver refused to take
it. Nearly an hour and a half was spent in looking for a furniture car.
Finally one was procured, and again the box was laid hold of by the
occupant's particular friend, when, to his dread alarm, the poor fellow
within gave a sudden cough. At this startling circumstance he dropped
the box; equally as quick, although dreadfully frightened, and, as if
helped by some invisible agency, he commenced singing, "Hush, my babe,
lie still and slumber," with the most apparent indifference, at the same
time slowly making his way from the box. Soon his fears subsided, and it
was presumed that no one was any the wiser on account of the accident,
or coughing. Thus, after summoning courage, he laid hold of the box a
third time, and the Rubicon was passed. The car driver, totally ignorant
of the contents of the box, drove to the number to which he was directed
to take it--left it and went about his business. Now is a moment of
intense interest--now of inexpressible delight. The box is opened, the
straw removed, and the poor fellow is loosed; and is rejoicing, I will
venture to say, as mortal never did rejoice, who had not been in similar
peril. This particular friend was scarcely less overjoyed, however, and
their joy did not abate for several hours; nor was it confined to
themselves, for two invited members of the Vigilance Committee also
partook of a full share. This box man was named Wm. Jones. He was boxed
up in Baltimore by the friend who received him at the wharf, who did not
come in the boat with him, but came in the cars and met him at the
wharf.

The trial in the box lasted just seventeen hours before victory was
achieved. Jones was well cared for by the Vigilance Committee and sent
on his way rejoicing, feeling that Resolution, Underground Rail Road,
and Liberty were invaluable.

On his way to Canada, he stopped at Albany, and the subjoined letter
gives his view of things from that stand-point--

His good friend returned to Baltimore the same day the box man started
for the North, and immediately dispatched through the post the following
brief letter, worded in Underground Rail Road parables:

WESLEY HARRIS,[A] ALIAS ROBERT JACKSON, AND THE MATTERSON BROTHERS.

[Footnote A: Shot by slave-hunters.]

In setting out for freedom, Wesley was the leader of this party. After
two nights of fatiguing travel at a distance of about sixty miles from
home, the young aspirants for liberty were betrayed, and in an attempt
made to capture them a most bloody conflict ensued. Both fugitives and
pursuers were the recipients of severe wounds from gun shots, and other
weapons used in the contest.

Wesley bravely used his fire arms until almost fatally wounded by one of
the pursuers, who with a heavily loaded gun discharged the contents with
deadly aim in his left arm, which raked the flesh from the bone for a
space of about six inches in length. One of Wesley's companions also
fought heroically and only yielded when badly wounded and quite
overpowered. The two younger (brothers of C. Matterson) it seemed made
no resistance.

In order to recall the adventures of this struggle, and the success of
Wesley Harris, it is only necessary to copy the report as then penned
from the lips of this young hero, while on the Underground Rail Road,
even then in a very critical state. Most fearful indeed was his
condition when he was brought to the Vigilance Committee in this City.

UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD RECORD.

_November 2d_, 1853.--Arrived: Robert Jackson (shot man), _alias_ Wesley
Harris; age twenty-two years; dark color; medium height, and of slender
stature.

Robert was born in Martinsburg, Va., and was owned by Philip Pendleton.
From a boy he had always been hired out. At the first of this year he
commenced services with Mrs. Carroll, proprietress of the United States
Hotel at Harper's Ferry. Of Mrs. Carroll he speaks in very grateful
terms, saying that she was kind to him and all the servants, and
promised them their freedom at her death. She excused herself for not
giving them their freedom on the ground that her husband died insolvent,
leaving her the responsibility of settling his debts.

But while Mrs. Carroll was very kind to her servants, her manager was
equally as cruel. About a month before Wesley left, the overseer, for
some trifling cause, attempted to flog him, but was resisted, and
himself flogged. This resistance of the slave was regarded by the
overseer as an unpardonable offence; consequently he communicated the
intelligence to his owner, which had the desired effect on his mind as
appeared from his answer to the overseer, which was nothing less than
instructions that if he should again attempt to correct Wesley and he
should repel the wholesome treatment, the overseer was to put him in
prison and sell him. Whether he offended again or not, the following
Christmas he was to be sold without fail.

Wesley's mistress was kind enough to apprise him of the intention of his
owner and the overseer, and told him that if he could help himself he
had better do so. So from that time Wesley began to contemplate how he
should escape the doom which had been planned for him.

"A friend," says he, "by the name of C. Matterson, told me that he was
going off. Then I told him of my master's writing to Mrs. Carroll
concerning selling, etc., and that I was going off too. We then
concluded to go together. There were two others--brothers of
Matterson--who were told of our plan to escape, and readily joined with
us in the undertaking. So one Saturday night, at twelve o'clock, we set
out for the North. After traveling upwards of two days and over sixty
miles, we found ourselves unexpectedly in Terrytown, Md. There we were
informed by a friendly colored man of the danger we were in and of the
bad character of the place towards colored people, especially those who
were escaping to freedom; and he advised us to hide as quickly as we
could. We at once went to the woods and hid. Soon after we had secreted
ourselves a man came near by and commenced splitting wood, or rails,
which alarmed us. We then moved to another hiding-place in a thicket
near a farmer's barn, where we were soon startled again by a dog
approaching and barking at us. The attention of the owner of the dog was
drawn to his barking and to where we were. The owner of the dog was a
farmer. He asked us where we were going. We replied to Gettysburg--to
visit some relatives, etc. He told us that we were running off. He then
offered friendly advice, talked like a Quaker, and urged us to go with
him to his barn for protection. After much persuasion, we consented to
go with him.

"Soon after putting us in his barn, himself and daughter prepared us a
nice breakfast, which cheered our spirits, as we were hungry. For this
kindness we paid him one dollar. He next told us to hide on the mow till
eve, when he would safely direct us on our road to Gettysburg. All, very
much fatigued from traveling, fell asleep, excepting myself; I could not
sleep; I felt as if all was not right.

"About noon men were heard talking around the barn. I woke my companions
up and told them that that man had betrayed us. At first they did not
believe me. In a moment afterwards the barn door was opened, and in came
the men, eight in number. One of the men asked the owner of the barn if
he had any long straw. 'Yes,' was the answer. So up on the mow came
three of the men, when, to their great surprise, as they pretended, we
were discovered. The question was then asked the owner of the barn by
one of the men, if he harbored runaway negroes in his barn? He answered,
'No,' and pretended to be entirely ignorant of their being in his barn.
One of the men replied that four negroes were on the mow, and he knew of
it. The men then asked us where we were, going. We told them to
Gettysburg, that we had aunts and a mother there. Also we spoke of a Mr.
Houghman, a gentleman we happened to have some knowledge of, having seen
him in Virginia. We were next asked for our passes. We told them that we
hadn't any, that we had not been required to carry them where we came
from. They then said that we would have to go before a magistrate, and
if he allowed us to go on, well and good. The men all being armed and
furnished with ropes, we were ordered to be tied. I told them if they
took me they would have to take me dead or crippled. At that instant one
of my friends cried out--'Where is the man that betrayed us?' Spying him
at the same moment, he shot him (badly wounding him). Then the conflict
fairly began. The constable seized me by the collar, or rather behind my
shoulder. I at once shot him with my pistol, but in consequence of his
throwing up his arm, which hit mine as I fired, the effect of the load
of my pistol was much turned aside; his face, however, was badly burned,
besides his shoulder being wounded. I again fired on the pursuers, but
do not know whether I hit anybody or not. I then drew a sword, I had
brought with me, and was about cutting my way to the door, when I was
shot by one of the men, receiving the entire contents of one load of a
double barreled gun in my left arm, that being the arm with which I was
defending myself. The load brought me to the ground, and I was unable to
make further struggle for myself. I was then badly beaten with guns, &c.
In the meantime, my friend Craven, who was defending himself, was shot
badly in the face, and most violently beaten until he was conquered and
tied. The two young brothers of Craven stood still, without making the
least resistance. After we were fairly captured, we were taken to
Terrytown, which was in sight of where we were betrayed. By this time I
had lost so much blood from my wounds, that they concluded my situation
was too dangerous to admit of being taken further; so I was made a
prisoner at a tavern, kept by a man named Fisher. There my wounds were
dressed, and thirty-two shot were taken from my arm. For three days I
was crazy, and they thought I would die. During the first two weeks,
while I was a prisoner at the tavern, I raised a great deal of blood,
and was considered in a very dangerous condition--so much so that
persons desiring to see me were not permitted. Afterwards I began to get
better, and was then kept privately--was strictly watched day and night.
Occasionally, however, the cook, a colored woman (Mrs. Smith), would
manage to get to see me. Also James Matthews succeeded in getting to see
me; consequently, as my wounds healed, and my senses came to me, I began
to plan how to make another effort to escape. I asked one of the
friends, alluded to above, to get me a rope. He got it. I kept it about
me four days in my pocket; in the meantime I procured three nails. On
Friday night, October 14th, I fastened my nails in under the window
sill; tied my rope to the nails, threw my shoes out of the window, put
the rope in my mouth, then took hold of it with my well hand, clambered
into the window, very weak, but I managed to let myself down to the
ground. I was so weak, that I could scarcely walk, but I managed to
hobble off to a place three quarters of a mile from the tavern, where a
friend had fixed upon for me to go, if I succeeded in making my escape.
There I was found by my friend, who kept me secure till Saturday eve,
when a swift horse was furnished by James Rogers, and a colored man
found to conduct me to Gettysburg. Instead of going direct to
Gettysburg, we took a different road, in order to shun our pursuers, as
the news of my escape had created general excitement. My three other
companions, who were captured, were sent to Westminster jail, where they
were kept three weeks, and afterwards sent to Baltimore and sold for
twelve hundred dollars a piece, as I was informed while at the tavern in
Terrytown."

[Illustration: DESPERATE CONFLICT IN A BARN.]

The Vigilance Committee procured good medical attention and afforded the
fugitive time for recuperation, furnished him with clothing and a free
ticket, and sent him on his way greatly improved in health, and strong
in the faith that, "He who would be free, himself must strike the blow."
His safe arrival in Canada, with his thanks, were duly announced. And
some time after becoming naturalized, in one of his letters, he wrote
that he was a brakesman on the Great Western R.R., (in Canada--promoted
from the U.G.R.R.,) the result of being under the protection of the
British Lion.

DEATH OF ROMULUS HALL--NEW NAME GEORGE WEEMS.


In March, 1857, Abram Harris fled from John Henry Suthern, who lived
near Benedict, Charles county, Md., where he was engaged in the farming
business, and was the owner of about seventy head of slaves. He kept an
overseer, and usually had flogging administered daily, on males and
females, old and young. Abram becoming very sick of this treatment,
resolved, about the first of March, to seek out the Underground Rail
Road. But for his strong attachment to his wife (who was owned by Samuel
Adams, but was "pretty well treated"), he never would have consented to
suffer as he did.

Here no hope of comfort for the future seemed to remain. So Abram
consulted with a fellow-servant, by the name of Romulus Hall, alias
George Weems, and being very warm friends, concluded to start together.
Both had wives to "tear themselves from," and each was equally ignorant
of the distance they had to travel, and the dangers and sufferings to be
endured. But they "trusted in God" and kept the North Star in view. For
nine days and nights, without a guide, they traveled at a very
exhausting rate, especially as they had to go fasting for three days,
and to endure very cold weather. Abram's companion, being about fifty
years of age, felt obliged to succumb, both from hunger and cold, and
had to be left on the way. Abram was a man of medium size, tall, dark
chestnut color, and could read and write a little and was quite
intelligent; "was a member of the Mount Zion Church," and occasionally
officiated as an "exhorter," and really appeared to be a man of genuine
faith in the Almighty, and equally as much in freedom.

In substance, Abram gave the following information concerning his
knowledge of affairs on the farm under his master--

"Master and mistress very frequently visited the Protestant Church, but
were not members. Mistress was very bad. About three weeks before I
left, the overseer, in a violent fit of bad temper, shot and badly
wounded a young slave man by the name of Henry Waters, but no sooner
than he got well enough he escaped, and had not been heard of up to the
time Abram left. About three years before this happened, an overseer of
my master was found shot dead on the road. At once some of the slaves
were suspected, and were all taken to the Court House, at Serentown, St.
Mary's county; but all came off clear. After this occurrence a new
overseer, by the name of John Decket, was employed. Although his
predecessor had been dead three years, Decket, nevertheless, concluded
that it was not 'too late' to flog the secret out of some of the slaves.
Accordingly, he selected a young slave man for his victim, and flogged
him so cruelly that he could scarcely walk or stand, and to keep from
being actually killed, the boy told an untruth, and confessed that he
and his Uncle Henry killed Webster, the overseer; whereupon the poor
fellow was sent to jail to be tried for his life."

But Abram did not wait to hear the verdict. He reached the Committee
safely in this city, in advance of his companion, and was furnished with
a free ticket and other needed assistance, and was sent on his way
rejoicing. After reaching his destination, he wrote back to know how his
friend and companion (George) was getting along; but in less than three
weeks after he had passed, the following brief story reveals the sad
fate of poor _Romulus Hall_, who had journeyed with him till exhausted
from hunger and badly frost-bitten.

A few days after his younger companion had passed on North, Romulus was
brought by a pitying stranger to the Vigilance Committee, in a most
shocking condition. The frost had made sad havoc with his feet and legs,
so much so that all sense of feeling had departed therefrom.

[Illustration: DEATH OF ROMULUS HALL.]

How he ever reached this city is a marvel. On his arrival medical
attention and other necessary comforts were provided by the Committee,
who hoped with himself, that he would be restored with the loss of his
toes alone. For one week he seemed to be improving; at the expiration of
this time, however, his symptoms changed, indicating not only the end of
slavery, but also the end of all his earthly troubles.

Lockjaw and mortification set in in the most malignant form, and for
nearly thirty-six hours the unfortunate victim suffered in extreme
agony, though not a murmur escaped him for having brought upon himself
in seeking his liberty this painful infliction and death. It was
wonderful to see how resignedly he endured his fate.

Being anxious to get his testimony relative to his escape, etc., the
Chairman of the Committee took his pencil and expressed to him his
wishes in the matter. Amongst other questions, he was asked: "Do you
regret having attempted to escape from slavery?" After a severe spasm he
said, as his friend was about to turn to leave the room, hopeless of
being gratified in his purpose: "Don't go; I have not answered your
question. I am glad I escaped from slavery!" He then gave his name, and
tried to tell the name of his master, but was so weak he could not be
understood.

At his bedside, day and night, Slavery looked more heinous than it had
ever done before. Only think how this poor man, in an enlightened
Christian land, for the bare hope of freedom, in a strange land amongst
strangers, was obliged not only to bear the sacrifice of his wife and
kindred, but also of his own life.

Nothing ever appeared more sad than seeing him in a dying posture, and
instead of reaching his much coveted destination in Canada, going to
that "bourne whence no traveler returns." Of course it was expedient,
even after his death, that only a few friends should follow him to his
grave. Nevertheless, he was decently buried in the beautiful Lebanon
Cemetery.

In his purse was found one single five cent piece, his whole pecuniary
dependence.

This was the first instance of death on the Underground Rail Road in
this region.

The Committee were indebted to the medical services of the well-known
friends of the fugitive, Drs. J.L. Griscom and H.T. Childs, whose
faithful services were freely given; and likewise to Mrs. H.S. Duterte
and Mrs. Williams, who generously performed the offices of charity and
friendship at his burial.

From his companion, who passed on Canada-ward without delay, we received
a letter, from which, as an item of interest, we make the following
extract:


    "I am enjoying good health, and hope when this reaches you, you
    may be enjoying the same blessing. Give my love to Mr. ----, and
    family, and tell them I am in a land of liberty! I am a man
    among men!" (The above was addressed to the deceased.)


The subjoined letter, from Rev. L.D. Mansfield, expressed on behalf of
Romulus' companion, his sad feelings on hearing of his friend's death.
And here it may not be inappropriate to add, that clearly enough is it
to be seen, that Rev. Mansfield was one of the rare order of ministers,
who believed it right "to do unto others as one would be done by" in
practice, not in theory merely, and who felt that they could no more be
excused for "falling down," in obedience to the Fugitive Slave Law under
President Fillmore, than could Daniel for worshiping the "golden image"
under Nebuchadnezzar.


    AUBURN, NEW YORK, MAY 4TH, 1857.

    DEAR BR. STILL:--Henry Lemmon wishes me to write to you in reply
    to your kind letter, conveying the intelligence of the death of
    your fugitive guest, Geo. Weems. He was deeply affected at the
    intelligence, for he was most devotedly attached to him and had
    been for many years. Mr. Lemmon now expects his sister to come
    on, and wishes you to aid her in any way in your power--as he
    knows you will.

    He wishes you to send the coat and cap of Weems by his sister
    when she comes. And when you write out the history of Weems'
    escape, and it is published, that you would send him a copy of
    the papers. He has not been very successful in getting work yet.

    Mr. and Mrs. Harris left for Canada last week. The friends made
    them a purse of $15 or $20, and we hope they will do well.

    Mr. Lemmon sends his respects to you and Mrs. Still. Give my
    kind regards to her and accept also yourself,

    Yours very truly,

    L.D. MANSFIELD.

JAMES MERCER, WM. H. GILLIAM, AND JOHN CLAYTON.


STOWED AWAY IN A HOT BERTH.


This arrival came by Steamer. But they neither came in State-room nor as
Cabin, Steerage, or Deck passengers.

A certain space, not far from the boiler, where the heat and coal dust
were almost intolerable,--the colored steward on the boat in answer to
an appeal from these unhappy bondmen, could point to no other place for
concealment but this. Nor was he at all certain that they could endure
the intense heat of that place. It admitted of no other posture than
lying flat down, wholly shut out from the light, and nearly in the same
predicament in regard to the air. Here, however, was a chance of
throwing off the yoke, even if it cost them their lives. They considered
and resolved to try it at all hazards.

Henry Box Brown's sufferings were nothing, compared to what these men
submitted to during the entire journey.

They reached the house of one of the Committee about three o'clock, A.M.

All the way from the wharf the cold rain poured down in torrents and
they got completely drenched, but their hearts were swelling with joy
and gladness unutterable. From the thick coating of coal dust, and the
effect of the rain added thereto, all traces of natural appearance were
entirely obliterated, and they looked frightful in the extreme. But they
had placed their lives in mortal peril for freedom.

Every step of their critical journey was reviewed and commented on, with
matchless natural eloquence,--how, when almost on the eve of suffocating
in their warm berths, in order to catch a breath of air, they were
compelled to crawl, one at a time, to a small aperture; but scarcely
would one poor fellow pass three minutes being thus refreshed, ere the
others would insist that he should "go back to his hole." Air was
precious, but for the time being they valued their liberty at still
greater price.

After they had talked to their hearts' content, and after they had been
thoroughly cleansed and changed in apparel, their physical appearance
could be easily discerned, which made it less a wonder whence such
outbursts of eloquence had emanated. They bore every mark of determined
manhood.

The date of this arrival was February 26, 1854, and the following
description was then recorded--

Arrived, by Steamer Pennsylvania, James Mercer, William H. Gilliam and
John Clayton, from Richmond.

James was owned by the widow, Mrs. T.E. White. He is thirty-two years of
age, of dark complexion, well made, good-looking, reads and writes, is
very fluent in speech, and remarkably intelligent. From a boy, he had
been hired out. The last place he had the honor to fill before escaping,
was with Messrs. Williams and Brother, wholesale commission merchants.
For his services in this store the widow had been drawing one hundred
and twenty-five dollars per annum, clear of all expenses.

He did not complain of bad treatment from his mistress, indeed, he spoke
rather favorably of her. But he could not close his eyes to the fact,
that at one time Mrs. White had been in possession of thirty head of
slaves, although at the time he was counting the cost of escaping, two
only remained--himself and William, (save a little boy) and on himself a
mortgage for seven hundred and fifty dollars was then resting. He could,
therefore, with his remarkably quick intellect, calculate about how long
it would be before he reached the auction block.

He had a wife but no child. She was owned by Mr. Henry W. Quarles. So
out of that Sodom he felt he would have to escape, even at the cost of
leaving his wife behind. Of course he felt hopeful that the way would
open by which she could escape at a future time, and so it did, as will
appear by and by. His aged mother he had to leave also.

Wm. Henry Gilliam likewise belonged to the Widow White, and he had been
hired to Messrs. White and Brother to drive their bread wagon. William
was a baker by trade. For his services his mistress had received one
hundred and thirty-five dollars per year. He thought his mistress quite
as good, if not a little better than most slave-holders. But he had
never felt persuaded to believe that she was good enough for him to
remain a slave for her support.

Indeed, he had made several unsuccessful attempts before this time to
escape from slavery and its horrors. He was fully posted from A to Z,
but in his own person he had been smart enough to escape most of the
more brutal outrages. He knew how to read and write, and in readiness of
speech and general natural ability was far above the average of slaves.

He was twenty-five years of age, well made, of light complexion, and
might be put down as a valuable piece of property.

This loss fell with crushing weight upon the kind-hearted mistress, as
will be seen in a letter subjoined which she wrote to the unfaithful
William, some time after he had fled.



LETTER FROM MRS. L.E. WHITE.



    RICHMOND, 16th, 1854.

    DEAR HENRY:--Your mother and myself received your letter; she is
    much distressed at your conduct; she is remaining just as you
    left her, she says, and she will never be reconciled to your
    conduct.

    I think Henry, you have acted most dishonorably; had you have
    made a confidant of me I would have been better off; and you as
    you are. I am badly situated, living with Mrs. Palmer, and
    having to put up with everything--your mother is also
    dissatisfied--I am miserably poor, do not get a cent of your
    hire or James', besides losing you both, but if you can
    _reconcile_ so do. By renting a cheap house, I might have lived,
    now it seems starvation is before me. Martha and the Doctor are
    living in Portsmouth, it is not in her power to do much for me.
    I know you will repent it. I heard six weeks before you went,
    that you were trying to persuade him off--but we all liked you,
    and I was unwilling to believe it--however, I leave it in God's
    hands He will know what to do. Your mother says that I must tell
    you servant Jones is _dead_ and old _Mrs. Galt_. Kit is well,
    but we are very uneasy, losing your and _James' hire_, I fear
    poor little fellow, that he will be obliged to go, as I am
    compelled to live, and it will be your fault. I am quite unwell,
    but of course, you don't care.

    Yours,

    L.E. WHITE.

    If you choose to come back you could. I would do a very good
    part by you, Toler and Cooke has none.


This touching epistle was given by the disobedient William to a member
of the Vigilant Committee, when on a visit to Canada, in 1855, and it
was thought to be of too much value to be lost. It was put away with
other valuable U.G.R.R. documents for future reference. Touching the
"rascality" of William and James and the unfortunate predicament in
which it placed the kind-hearted widow, Mrs. Louisa White, the following
editorial clipped from the wide-awake Richmond Despatch, was also highly
appreciated, and preserved as conclusive testimony to the successful
working of the U.G.R.R. in the Old Dominion. It reads thus--

"RASCALITY SOMEWHERE.--We called attention yesterday to the
advertisement of two negroes belonging to Mrs. Louisa White, by Toler &
Cook, and in the call we expressed the opinion that they were still
lurking about the city, preparatory to going off. Mr. Toler, we find, is
of a different opinion. He believes that they have already cleared
themselves--have escaped to a Free State, and we think it extremely
probable that he is in the right. They were both of them uncommonly
intelligent negroes. One of them, the one hired to Mr. White, was a
tip-top baker. He had been all about the country, and had been in the
habit of supplying the U.S. Pennsylvania with bread; Mr. W. having the
contract. In his visits for this purpose, of course, he formed
acquaintances with all sorts of sea-faring characters; and there is
every reason to believe that he has been assisted to get off in that
way, along with the other boy, hired to the Messrs. Williams. That the
two acted in concert, can admit of no doubt. The question is now to find
out how they got off. They must undoubtedly have had white men in the
secret. Have we then a nest of Abolition scoundrels among us? There
ought to be a law to put a police officer on board every vessel as soon
as she lands at the wharf. There is one, we believe for inspecting
vessels before they leave. If there is not there ought to be one.

"These negroes belong to a widow lady and constitute all the property
she has on earth. They have both been raised with the greatest
indulgence. Had it been otherwise, they would never have had an
opportunity to escape, as they have done. Their flight has left her
penniless. Either of them would readily have sold for $1200; and Mr.
Toler advised their owner to sell them at the commencement of the year,
probably anticipating the very thing that has happened. She refused to
do so, because she felt too much attachment to them. They have made a
fine return, truly."

No comment is necessary on the above editorial except simply to express
the hope that the editor and his friends who seemed to be utterly
befogged as to how these "uncommonly intelligent negroes" made their
escape, will find the problem satisfactorily solved in this book.

However, in order to do even-handed justice to all concerned, it seems
but proper that William and James should be heard from, and hence a
letter from each is here appended for what they are worth. True they
were intended only for private use, but since the "True light" (Freedom)
has come, all things may be made manifest.

"Our friend Minkins," in whose behalf William asks the united prayers of
his friends, was one of the "scoundrels" who assisted him and his two
companions to escape on the steamer. Being suspected of "rascality" in
this direction, he was arrested and put in jail, but as no evidence
could be found against him he was soon released.

    for a letter from you for Several days as the last was very
    interesting to me, please to write Right away.

    JOHN H. HILL.


Instead of weeping over the sad situation of his "penniless" mistress
and showing any signs of contrition for having wronged the man who held
the mortgage of seven hundred and fifty dollars on him, James actually
"feels rejoiced in the Lord for his liberty," and is "very much pleased
with Toronto;" but is not satisfied yet, he is even concocting a plan by
which his wife might be run off from Richmond, which would be the cause
of her owner (Henry W. Quarles, Esq.) losing at least one thousand
dollars,


    ST. CATHARINE, CANADA, JUNE 8th, 1854.

    MR. STILL, DEAR FRIEND:--I received a letter from the poor old
    widow, Mrs. L.E. White, and she says I may come back if I choose
    and she will do a good part by me. Yes, yes I am choosing the
    western side of the South for my home. She is smart, but cannot
    bung my eye, so she shall have to die in the poor house at last,
    so she says, and Mercer and myself will be the cause of it. That
    is all right. I am getting even with her now for I was in the
    poor house for twenty-five years and have just got out. And she
    said she knew I was coming away six weeks before I started, so
    you may know my chance was slim. But Mr. John Wright said I came
    off like a gentleman and he did not blame me for coming for I
    was a great boy. Yes I here him enough he is all gas. I am in
    Canada, and they cannot help themselves.

    About that subject I will not say anything more. You must write
    to me as soon as you can and let me here the news and how the
    Family is and yourself. Let me know how the times is with the
    U.G.R.R. Co. Is it doing good business? Mr. Dykes sends his
    respects to you. Give mine to your family.

    Your true friend,

    W.H. GILLIAM.


John Clayton, the companion in tribulation of William and James, must
not be lost sight of any longer. He was owned by the Widow Clayton, and
was white enough to have been nearly related to her, being a mulatto. He
was about thirty-five years of age, a man of fine appearance, and quite
intelligent. Several years previous he had made an attempt to escape,
but failed. Prior to escaping in this instance, he had been laboring in
a tobacco factory at $150 a year. It is needless to say that he did not
approve of the "peculiar institution." He left a wife and one child
behind to mourn after him. Of his views of Canada and Freedom, the
following frank and sensible letter, penned shortly after his arrival,
speaks for itself--


    TORONTO, March 6th, 1854.

    DEAR MR. STILL:--I take this method of informing you that I am
    well both in health and mind. You may rest assured that I fells
    myself a free man and do not fell as I did when I was in
    Virginia thanks be to God I have no master into Canada but I am
    my own man. I arrived safe into Canada on friday last. I must
    request of you to write a few lines to my wife and jest state to
    her that her friend arrived safe into this glorious land of
    liberty and I am well and she will make very short her time in
    Virginia. tell her that I likes here very well and hopes to like
    it better when I gets to work I don't meane for you to write the
    same words that are written above but I wish you give her a
    clear understanding where I am and Shall Remain here untel She
    comes or I hears from her.

    Nothing more at present but remain yours most respectfully,

    JOHN CLAYTON.

    You will please to direct the to Petersburg Luenena Johns or
    Clayton John is best.




CLARISSA DAVIS.


ARRIVED DRESSED IN MALE ATTIRE.


Clarissa fled from Portsmouth, Va., in May, 1854, with two of her
brothers. Two months and a half before she succeeded in getting off,
Clarissa had made a desperate effort, but failed. The brothers
succeeded, but she was left. She had not given up all hope of escape,
however, and therefore sought "a safe hiding-place until an opportunity
might offer," by which she could follow her brothers on the U.G.R.R.
Clarissa was owned by Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Burkley, of Portsmouth, under
whom she had always served.

Of them she spoke favorably, saying that she "had not been used as hard
as many others were." At this period, Clarissa was about twenty-two
years of age, of a bright brown complexion, with handsome features,
exceedingly respectful and modest, and possessed all the characteristics
of a well-bred young lady. For one so little acquainted with books as
she was, the correctness of her speech was perfectly astonishing.

For Clarissa and her two brothers a "reward of one thousand dollars" was
kept standing in the papers for a length of time, as these (articles)
were considered very rare and valuable; the best that could be produced
in Virginia.

In the meanwhile the brothers had passed safely on to New Bedford, but
Clarissa remained secluded, "waiting for the storm to subside." Keeping
up courage day by day, for seventy-five days, with the fear of being
detected and severely punished, and then sold, after all her hopes and
struggles, required the faith of a martyr. Time after time, when she
hoped to succeed in making her escape, ill luck seemed to disappoint
her, and nothing but intense suffering appeared to be in store. Like
many others, under the crushing weight of oppression, she thought she
"should have to die" ere she tasted liberty. In this state of mind, one
day, word was conveyed to her that the steamship, City of Richmond, had
arrived from Philadelphia, and that the steward on board (with whom she
was acquainted), had consented to secrete her this trip, if she could
manage to reach the ship safely, which was to start the next day. This
news to Clarissa was both cheering and painful. She had been "praying
all the time while waiting," but now she felt "that if it would only
rain right hard the next morning about three o'clock, to drive the
police officers off the street, then she could safely make her way to
the boat." Therefore she prayed anxiously all that day that it would
rain, "but no sign of rain appeared till towards midnight." The prospect
looked horribly discouraging; but she prayed on, and at the appointed
hour (three o'clock--before day), the rain descended in torrents.
Dressed in male attire, Clarissa left the miserable coop where she had
been almost without light or air for two and a half months, and
unmolested, reached the boat safely, and was secreted in a box by Wm.
Bagnal, a clever young man who sincerely sympathized with the slave,
having a wife in slavery himself; and by him she was safely delivered
into the hands of the Vigilance Committee.

Clarissa Davis here, by advice of the Committee, dropped her old name,
and was straightway christened "Mary D. Armstead." Desiring to join her
brothers and sister in New Bedford, she was duly furnished with her
U.G.R.R. passport and directed thitherward. Her father, who was left
behind when she got off, soon after made his way on North, and joined
his children. He was too old and infirm probably to be worth anything,
and had been allowed to go free, or to purchase himself for a mere
nominal sum. Slaveholders would, on some such occasions, show wonderful
liberality in letting their old slaves go free, when they could work no
more. After reaching New Bedford, Clarissa manifested her gratitude in
writing to her friends in Philadelphia repeatedly, and evinced a very
lively interest in the U.G.R.R. The appended letter indicates her
sincere feelings of gratitude and deep interest in the cause--


    NEW BEDFORD, August 26, 1855.

    MR. STILL:--I avail my self to write you thes few lines hopeing
    they may find you and your family well as they leaves me very
    well and all the family well except my father he seams to be
    improveing with his shoulder he has been able to work a little I
    received the papers I was highly delighted to receive them I was
    very glad to hear from you in the wheler case I was very glad to
    hear that the persons ware safe I was very sory to hear that mr
    Williamson was put in prison but I know if the praying part of
    the people will pray for him and if he will put his trust in the
    lord he will bring him out more than conquer please remember my
    Dear old farther and sisters and brothers to your family kiss
    the children for me I hear that the yellow fever is very bad
    down south now if the underground railroad could have free
    course the emergrant would cross the river of gordan rapidly I
    hope it may continue to run and I hope the wheels of the car may
    be greesed with more substantial greese so they may run over
    swiftly I would have wrote before but circumstances would not
    permit me  Miss Sanders and all the friends desired to be
    remembered to you and your family I shall be pleased to hear
    from the underground rail road often.

ANTHONY BLOW, ALIAS HENRY LEVISON.


SECRETED TEN MONTHS BEFORE STARTING--EIGHT DAYS STOWED AWAY ON A STEAMER
BOUND FOR PHILADELPHIA.


Arrived from Norfolk, about the 1st of November, 1854. Ten months before
starting, Anthony had been closely concealed. He belonged to the estate
of Mrs. Peters, a widow, who had been dead about one year before his
concealment.

On the settlement of his old mistress' estate, which was to take place
one year after her death, Anthony was to be transferred to Mrs. Lewis, a
daughter of Mrs. Peters (the wife of James Lewis, Esq.). Anthony felt
well satisfied that he was not the slave to please the "tyrannical
whims" of his anticipated master, young Lewis, and of course he hated
the idea of having to come under his yoke. And what made it still more
unpleasant for Anthony was that Mr. Lewis would frequently remind him
that it was his intention to "sell him as soon as he got possession--the
first day of January." "I can get fifteen hundred dollars for you
easily, and I will do it." This contemptuous threat had caused Anthony's
blood to boil time and again. But Anthony had to take the matter as
calmly as possible, which, however, he was not always able to do.

At any rate, Anthony concluded that his "young master had counted the
chickens before they were hatched." Indeed here Anthony began to be a
deep thinker. He thought, for instance, that he had already been shot
three times, at the instance of slave-holders. The first time he was
shot was for refusing a flogging when only eighteen years of age. The
second time, he was shot in the head with squirrel shot by the sheriff,
who was attempting to arrest him for having resisted three "young white
ruffians," who wished to have the pleasure of beating him, but got
beaten themselves. And in addition to being shot this time, Anthony was
still further "broke in" by a terrible flogging from the Sheriff. The
third time Anthony was shot he was about twenty-one years of age. In
this instance he was punished for his old offence--he "would not be
whipped."

This time his injury from being shot was light, compared with the two
preceding attacks. Also in connection with these murderous conflicts, he
could not forget that he had been sold on the auction block. But he had
still deeper thinking to do yet. He determined that his young master
should never get "fifteen hundred dollars for him on the 1st of
January," unless he got them while he (Anthony) was running. For Anthony
had fully made up his mind that when the last day of December ended, his
bondage should end also, even if he should have to accept death as a
substitute. He then began to think of the Underground Rail Road and of
Canada; but who the agents were, or how to find the depot, was a serious
puzzle to him. But his time was getting so short he was convinced that
whatever he did would have to be done quickly. In this frame of mind he
found a man who professed to know something about the Underground Rail
Road, and for "thirty dollars" promised to aid him in the matter.

The thirty dollars were raised by the hardest effort and passed over to
the pretended friend, with the expectation that it would avail greatly
in the emergency. But Anthony found himself sold for thirty dollars, as
nothing was done for him. However, the 1st day of January arrived, but
Anthony was not to be found to answer to his name at roll call. He had
"took out" very early in the morning. Daily he prayed in his place of
concealment how to find the U.G.R.R. Ten months passed away, during
which time he suffered almost death, but persuaded himself to believe
that even that was better than slavery. With Anthony, as it has been
with thousands of others similarly situated, just as everything was
looking the most hopeless, word came to him in his place of concealment
that a friend named Minkins, employed on the steamship City of Richmond,
would undertake to conceal him on the boat, if he could be crowded in a
certain place, which was about the only spot that would be perfectly
safe. This was glorious news to Anthony; but it was well for him that he
was ignorant of the situation that awaited him on the boat, or his heart
might have failed him. He was willing, however, to risk his life for
freedom, and, therefore, went joyfully.

The hiding-place was small and he was large. A sitting attitude was the
only way he could possibly occupy it. He was contented. This place was
"near the range, directly over the boiler," and of course, was very
warm. Nevertheless, Anthony felt that he would not murmur, as he knew
what suffering was pretty well, and especially as he took it for granted
that he would be free in about a day and a half--the usual time it took
the steamer to make her trip. At the appointed hour the steamer left
Norfolk for Philadelphia, with Anthony sitting flat down in his U.G.R.R.
berth, thoughtful and hopeful. But before the steamer had made half her
distance the storm was tossing the ship hither and thither fearfully.
Head winds blew terribly, and for a number of days the elements seemed
perfectly mad. In addition to the extraordinary state of the weather,
when the storm subsided the fog took its place and held the mastery of
the ship with equal despotism until the end of over seven days, when
finally the storm, wind, and fog all disappeared, and on the eighth day
of her boisterous passage the steamship City of Richmond landed at the
wharf of Philadelphia, with this giant and hero on board who had
suffered for ten months in his concealment on land and for eight days on
the ship.

Anthony was of very powerful physical proportions, being six feet three
inches in height, quite black, very intelligent, and of a temperament
that would not submit to slavery. For some years his master, Col.
Cunnagan, had hired him out in Washington, where he was accused of being
in the schooner Pearl, with Capt. Drayton's memorable "seventy fugitives
on board, bound for Canada." At this time he was stoker in a machine
shop, and was at work on an anchor weighing "ten thousand pounds." In
the excitement over the attempt to escape in the Pearl, many were
arrested, and the officers with irons visited Anthony at the machine
shop to arrest him, but he declined to let them put the hand-cuffs on
him, but consented to go with them, if permitted to do so without being
ironed. The officers yielded, and Anthony went willingly to the jail.
Passing unnoticed other interesting conflicts in his hard life, suffice
it to say, he left his wife, Ann, and three children, Benjamin, John and
Alfred, all owned by Col. Cunnagan. In this brave-hearted man, the
Committee felt a deep interest, and accorded him their usual
hospitalities.



PERRY JOHNSON, OF ELKTON, MARYLAND.


EYE KNOCKED OUT, ETC.


Perry's exit was in November, 1853. He was owned by Charles Johnson, who
lived at Elkton. The infliction of a severe "flogging" from the hand of
his master awakened Perry to consider the importance of the U.G.R.R.
Perry had the misfortune to let a "load of fodder upset," about which
his master became exasperated, and in his agitated state of mind he
succeeded in affixing a number of very ugly stationary marks on Perry's
back. However, this was no new thing. Indeed he had suffered at the
hands of his mistress even far more keenly than from these "ugly marks."
He had but one eye; the other he had been deprived of by a terrible
stroke with a cowhide in the "hand of his mistress." This lady he
pronounced to be a "perfect savage," and added that "she was in the
habit of cowhiding any of her slaves whenever she felt like it, which
was quite often." Perry was about twenty-eight years of age and a man of
promise. The Committee attended to his wants and forwarded him on North.

ISAAC FORMAN, WILLIAM DAVIS, AND WILLIS REDICK.


HEARTS FULL OF JOY FOR FREEDOM--VERY ANXIOUS FOR WIVES IN SLAVERY.




These passengers all arrived together, concealed, per steamship City of
Richmond, December, 1853. Isaac Forman, the youngest of the
party--twenty-three years of age and a dark mulatto--would be considered
by a Southerner capable of judging as "very likely." He fled from a
widow by the name of Mrs. Sanders, who had been in the habit of hiring
him out for "one hundred and twenty dollars a year." She belonged in
Norfolk, Va.; so did Isaac. For four years Isaac had served in the
capacity of steward on the steamship Augusta. He stated that he had a
wife living in Richmond, and that she was confined the morning he took
the U.G.R.R. Of course he could not see her. The privilege of living in
Richmond with his wife "had been denied him." Thus, fearing to render
her unhappy, he was obliged to conceal from her his intention to escape.
"Once or twice in the year was all the privilege allowed" him to visit
her. This only added "insult to injury," in Isaac's opinion; wherefore
he concluded that he would make one less to have to suffer thus, and
common sense said he was wise in the matter. No particular charges are
found recorded on the U.G.R.R. books against the mistress. He went to
Canada.

In the subjoined letters (about his wife) is clearly revealed the
sincere gratitude he felt towards those who aided him: at the same time
it may be seen how the thought of his wife being in bondage grieved his
heart. It would have required men with stone hearts to have turned deaf

EXTRACT OF LETTER FROM ISAAC FORMAN.



    TORONTO, Feb. 20th, 1854.

    MR. WILLIAM STILL:--_Sir_--Your kind letter arrived safe at hand
    on the 18th, and I was very happy to receive it. I now feel that
    I should return you some thanks for your kindness. Dear sir I do
    pray from the bottom of my heart, that the high heavens may
    bless you for your kindness; give my love to Mr. Bagnel and Mr.
    Minkins, ask them if they have heard anything from my brother,
    tell Mr. Bagnel to give my love to my sister-in-law and mother
    and all the family. I am now living at Russell's Hotel; it is
    the first situation I have had since I have been here and I like
    it very well. Sir you would oblige me by letting me know if Mr.
    Minkins has seen my wife; you will please let me know as soon as
    possible. I wonder if Mr. Minkins has thought of any way that he
    can get my wife away. I should like to know in a few days.

    Your well wisher,

    ISAAC FORMAN.


Another letter from Isaac. He is very gloomy and his heart is almost
breaking about his wife.



SECOND LETTER.



    TORONTO, May 7,1854.

    MR. W. STILL:--_Dear Sir_--I take this opportunity of writing
    you these few lines and hope when they reach you they will find
    you well. I would have written you before, but I was waiting to
    hear from my friend, Mr. Brown. I judge his business has been of
    importance as the occasion why he has not written before. Dear
    sir, nothing would have prevented me from writing, in a case of
    this kind, except death.

    My soul is vexed, my troubles are inexpressible. I often feel as
    if I were willing to die. I must see my wife in short, if not, I
    will die. What would I not give no tongue can utter. Just to
    gaze on her sweet lips one moment I would be willing to die the
    next. I am determined to see her some time or other. The thought
    of being a slave again is miserable. I hope heaven will smile
    upon me again, before I am one again. I will leave Canada again
    shortly, but I don't name the place that I go, it may be in the
    bottom of the ocean. If I had known as much before I left, as I
    do now, I would never have left until I could have found means
    to have brought her with me. You have never suffered from being
    absent from a wife, as I have. I consider that to be nearly
    superior to death, and hope you will do all you can for me, and
    inquire from your friends if nothing can be done for me. Please
    write to me immediately on receipt of this, and say something
    that will cheer up my drooping spirits. You will oblige me by
    seeing Mr. Brown and ask him if he would oblige me by going to
    Richmond and see my wife, and see what arrangements he could
    make with her, and I would be willing to pay all his expenses
    there and back. Please to see both Mr. Bagnel and Mr. Minkins,
    and ask them if they have seen my wife. I am determined to see
    her, if I die the next moment. I can say I was once happy, but
    never will be again, until I see her; because what is freedom to
    me, when I know that my wife is in slavery? Those persons that
    you shipped a few weeks ago, remained at St. Catherine, instead
    of coming over to Toronto. I sent you two letters last week and
    I hope you will please attend to them. The post-office is shut,
    so I enclose the money to pay the post, and please write me in
    haste.

    I remain evermore your obedient servant,

    I. FORMAN.




WILLIS REDICK.


He was owned by S.J. Wilson, a merchant, living in Portsmouth, Va.
Willis was of a very dark hue, thick set, thirty-two years of age, and
possessed of a fair share of mind. The owner had been accustomed to hire
Willis out for "one hundred dollars a year." Willis thought his lot
"pretty hard," and his master rather increased this notion by his
severity, and especially by "threatening" to sell him. He had enjoyed,
as far as it was expected for a slave to do, "five months of married
life," but he loved slavery no less on this account. In fact he had just
begun to consider what it was to have a wife and children that he "could
not own or protect," and who were claimed as another's property.
Consequently he became quite restive under these reflections and his
master's ill-usage, and concluded to "look out," without consulting
either the master or the young wife.

This step looked exceedingly hard, but what else could the poor fellow
do? Slavery existed expressly for the purpose of crushing souls and
breaking tender hearts.

WILLIAM DAVIS.


William might be described as a good-looking mulatto, thirty-one years
of age, and capable of thinking for himself. He made no grave complaints
of ill-usage under his master, "Joseph Reynolds," who lived at Newton,
Portsmouth, Va. However, his owner had occasionally "threatened to sell
him." As this was too much for William's sensitive feelings, he took
umbrage at it and made a hasty and hazardous move, which resulted in
finding himself on the U.G.R.R. The most serious regret William had to
report to the Committee was, that he was compelled to "leave" his
"wife," Catharine, and his little daughter, Louisa, two years and one
month, and an infant son seven months old. He evidently loved them very
tenderly, but saw no way by which he could aid them, as long as he was
daily liable to be put on the auction block and sold far South. This
argument was regarded by the Committee as logical and unanswerable;
consequently they readily endorsed his course, while they deeply
sympathized with his poor wife and little ones. "Before escaping," he
"dared not" even apprise his wife and child, whom he had to leave behind
in the prison house.

JOSEPH HENRY CAMP.


THE AUCTION BLOCK IS DEFEATED AND A SLAVE TRADER LOSES FOURTEEN HUNDRED
DOLLARS.


In November, 1853, in the twentieth year of his age, Camp was held to
"service or labor" in the City of Richmond, Va., by Dr. K. Clark. Being
uncommonly smart and quite good-looking at the same time, he was a
saleable piece of merchandise. Without consulting his view of the matter
or making the least intimation of any change, the master one day struck
up a bargain with a trader for Joseph, and received _Fourteen Hundred
Dollars cash_ in consideration thereof. Mr. Robert Parrett, of Parson &
King's Express office, happened to have a knowledge of what had
transpired, and thinking pretty well of Joseph, confidentially put him
in full possession of all the facts in the case. For reflection he
hardly had five minutes. But he at once resolved to strike that day for
freedom--not to go home that evening to be delivered into the hands of
his new master. In putting into execution his bold resolve, he secreted
himself, and so remained for three weeks. In the meantime his mother,
who was a slave, resolved to escape also, but after one week's gloomy
foreboding, she became "faint-hearted and gave the struggle over." But
Joseph did not know what surrender meant. His sole thought was to
procure a ticket on the U.G.R.R. for Canada, which by persistent effort
he succeeded in doing. He hid himself in a steamer, and by this way
reached Philadelphia, where he received every accommodation at the usual
depot, was provided with a free ticket, and sent off rejoicing for
Canada. The unfortunate mother was "detected and sold South."

SHERIDAN FORD.


SECRETED IN THE WOODS--ESCAPES IN A STEAMER.


About the twenty-ninth of January, 1855, Sheridan arrived from the Old
Dominion and a life of bondage, and was welcomed cordially by the
Vigilance Committee. Miss Elizabeth Brown of Portsmouth, Va. claimed
Sheridan as her property. He spoke rather kindly of her, and felt that
he "had not been used very hard" as a general thing, although, he wisely
added, "the best usage was bad enough." Sheridan had nearly reached his
twenty-eighth year, was tall and well made, and possessed of a
considerable share of intelligence.

Not a great while before making up his mind to escape, for some trifling
offence he had been "stretched up with a rope by his hands," and
"whipped unmercifully." In addition to this he had "got wind of the
fact," that he was to be auctioneered off; soon these things brought
serious reflections to Sheridan's mind, and among other questions, he
began to ponder how he could get a ticket on the U.G.R.R., and get out
of this "place of torment," to where he might have the benefit of his
own labor. In this state of mind, about the fourteenth day of November,
he took his first and daring step. He went not, however, to learned
lawyers or able ministers of the Gospel in his distress and trouble, but
wended his way "directly to the woods," where he felt that he would be
safer with the wild animals and reptiles, in solitude, than with the
barbarous civilization that existed in Portsmouth.

The first day in the woods he passed in prayer incessantly, all alone.
In this particular place of seclusion he remained "four days and
nights," "two days suffered severely from hunger, cold and thirst."
However, one who was a "friend" to him, and knew of his whereabouts,
managed to get some food to him and consoling words; but at the end of
the four days this friend got into some difficulty and thus Sheridan was
left to "wade through deep waters and head winds" in an almost hopeless
state. There he could not consent to stay and starve to death.
Accordingly he left and found another place of seclusion--with a friend
in the town--for a pecuniary consideration. A secret passage was
procured for him on one of the steamers running between Philadelphia and
Richmond, Va. When he left his poor wife, Julia, she was then "lying in
prison to be sold," on the simple charge of having been suspected of
conniving at her husband's escape. As a woman she had known something of
the "barbarism of slavery", from every-day experience, which the large
scars about her head indicated--according to Sheridan's testimony. She
was the mother of two children, but had never been allowed to have the
care of either of them. The husband, utterly powerless to offer her the
least sympathy in word or deed, left this dark habitation of cruelty, as
above referred to, with no hope of ever seeing wife or child again in
this world.

The Committee afforded him the usual aid and comfort, and passed him on
to the next station, with his face set towards Boston. He had heard the
slaveholders "curse" Boston so much, that he concluded it must be a
pretty safe place for the fugitive.

JOSEPH KNEELAND, ALIAS JOSEPH HULSON.


Joseph Kneeland arrived November 25, 1853. He was a prepossessing man of
twenty-six, dark complexion, and intelligent. At the time of Joseph's
escape, he was owned by Jacob Kneeland, who had fallen heir to him as a
part of his father's estate. Joseph spoke of his old master as having
treated him "pretty well," but he had an idea that his young master had
a very "malignant spirit;" for even before the death of his old master,
the heir wanted him, "Joe," sold, and after the old man died, matters
appeared to be coming to a crisis very fast. Even as early as November,
the young despot had distinctly given "Joe" to understand, that he was
not to be hired out another year, intimating that he was to "go
somewhere," but as to particulars, it was time enough for Joe to know
them.

Of course "Joe" looked at his master "right good" and saw right through
him, and at the same time, saw the U.G.R.R., "darkly." Daily slavery
grew awfully mean, but on the other hand, Canada was looked upon as a
very desirable country to emigrate to, and he concluded to make his way
there, as speedily as the U.G.R.R. could safely convey him. Accordingly
he soon carried his design into practice, and on his arrival, the
Committee regarded him as a very good subject for her British Majesty's
possessions in Canada.

EX-PRESIDENT TYLER'S HOUSEHOLD LOSES AN ARISTOCRATIC "ARTICLE."


James Hambleton Christian is a remarkable specimen of the "well fed,
&c." In talking with him relative to his life as a slave, he said very
promptly, "I have always been treated well; if I only have half as good
times in the North as I have had in the South, I shall be perfectly
satisfied. Any time I desired spending money, five or ten dollars were
no object." At times, James had borrowed of his master, one, two, and
three hundred dollars, to loan out to some of his friends. With regard
to apparel and jewelry, he had worn the best, as an every-day adornment.
With regard to food also, he had fared as well as heart could wish, with
abundance of leisure time at his command. His deportment was certainly
very refined and gentlemanly. About fifty per cent. of Anglo-Saxon blood
was visible in his features and his hair, which gave him no
inconsiderable claim to sympathy and care. He had been to William and
Mary's College in his younger days, to wait on young master James B.C.,
where, through the kindness of some of the students he had picked up a
trifling amount of book learning. To be brief, this man was born the
slave of old Major Christian, on the Glen Plantation, Charles City
county, Va. The Christians were wealthy and owned many slaves, and
belonged in reality to the F.F.V's. On the death of the old Major, James
fell into the hands of his son, Judge Christian, who was executor to his
father's estate. Subsequently he fell into the hands of one of the
Judge's sisters, Mrs. John Tyler (wife of Ex-President Tyler), and then
he became a member of the President's domestic household, was at the
White House, under the President, from 1841 to 1845. Though but very
young at that time, James was only fit for training in the arts,
science, and mystery of waiting, in which profession, much pains were
taken to qualify him completely for his calling.

After a lapse of time; his mistress died. According to her request,
after this event, James and his old mother were handed over to her
nephew, William H. Christian, Esq., a merchant of Richmond. From this
gentleman, James had the folly to flee.

Passing hurriedly over interesting details, received from him respecting
his remarkable history, two or three more incidents too good to omit
must suffice.

"How did you like Mr. Tyler?" said an inquisitive member of the
Vigilance Committee. "I didn't like Mr. Tyler much," was the reply.
"Why?" again inquired the member of the Committee. "Because Mr. Tyler
was a poor man. I never did like poor people. I didn't like his marrying
into our family, who were considered very far Tyler's superiors." "On
the plantation," he said, "Tyler was a very cross man, and treated the
servants very cruelly; but the house servants were treated much better,
owing to their having belonged to his wife, who protected them from
persecution, as they had been favorite servants in her father's family."
James estimated that "Tyler got about thirty-five thousand dollars and
twenty-nine slaves, young and old, by his wife."

What prompted James to leave such pleasant quarters? It was this: He had
become enamored of a young and respectable free girl in Richmond, with
whom he could not be united in marriage solely because he was a slave,
and did not own himself. The frequent sad separations of such married
couples (where one or the other was a slave) could not be overlooked;
consequently, the poor fellow concluded that he would stand a better
chance of gaining his object in Canada than by remaining in Virginia. So
he began to feel that he might himself be sold some day, and thus the
resolution came home to him very forcibly to make tracks for Canada.

In speaking of the good treatment he had always met with, a member of
the Committee remarked, "You must be akin to some one of your master's
family?" To which he replied, "I am Christian's son." Unquestionably
this passenger was one of that happy class so commonly referred to by
apologists for the "Patriarchal Institution." The Committee, feeling a
deep interest in his story, and desiring great success to him in his
Underground efforts to get rid of slavery, and at the same time possess
himself of his affianced, made him heartily welcome, feeling assured
that the struggles and hardships he had submitted to in escaping, as
well as the luxuries he was leaving behind, were nothing to be compared
with the blessings of liberty and a free wife in Canada.

    "TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS REWARD.--The above Reward will be paid for
    the apprehension of two blacks, who escaped on Sunday last. It
    is supposed they have made their way to Pennsylvania. $500 will
    be paid for the apprehension of either, so that we can get them

    them address Elizabeth Brown, Sandy Hook P.O., or of Thomas
    Johnson, Abingdon P.O., Harford county, Md.

    "ELIZABETH BROWN.

    "THOMAS JOHNSON."




FROM THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD RECORDS.


The following memorandum is made, which, if not too late, may afford
some light to "Elizabeth Brown and Thomas Johnson," if they have not
already gone the way of the "lost cause"--

_June_ 4, 1857.--Edward is a hardy and firm-looking young man of
twenty-four years of age, chestnut color, medium size, and
"likely,"--would doubtless bring $1,400 in the market. He had been held
as the property of the widow, "Betsy Brown," who resided near Mill Green
P.O., in Harford county, Md. "She was a very bad woman; would go to
church every Sunday, come home and go to fighting amongst the colored
people; was never satisfied; she treated my mother very hard, (said
Ed.); would beat her with a walking-stick, &c. She was an old woman and
belonged to the Catholic Church. Over her slaves she kept an overseer,
who was a very wicked man; very bad on colored people; his name was
'Bill Eddy;' Elizabeth Brown owned twelve head."

Henry is of a brown skin, a good-looking young man, only nineteen years
of age, whose prepossessing appearance would insure a high price for him
in the market--perhaps $1,700. With Edward, he testifies to the meanness
of Mrs. Betsy Brown, as well as to his own longing desire for freedom.
Being a fellow-servant with Edward, Henry was a party to the plan of
escape. In slavery he left his mother and three sisters, owned by the
"old woman" from whom he escaped.

James is about twenty-one years of age, full black, and medium size. As
he had been worked hard on poor fare, he concluded to leave, in company
with his brother and two cousins, leaving his parents in slavery, owned
by the "Widow Pyle," who was also the owner of himself. "She was upwards
of eighty, very passionate and ill-natured, although a member of the
Presbyterian Church." James may be worth $1,400.

Stephen is a brother of James', and is about the same size, though a
year older. His experience differed in no material respect from his
brother's; was owned by the same woman, whom he "hated for her bad
treatment" of him. Would bring $1,400, perhaps.

In substance, and to a considerable extent in the exact words, these
facts are given as they came from the lips of the passengers, who,
though having been kept in ignorance and bondage, seemed to have their
eyes fully open to the wrongs that had been heaped upon them, and were
singularly determined to reach free soil at all hazards. The Committee
willingly attended to their financial and other wants, and cheered them
on with encouraging advice.

They were indebted to "The Baltimore Sun" for the advertisement
information. And here it may be further added, that the "Sun" was quite
famous for this kind of U.G.R.R. literature, and on that account alone
the Committee subscribed for it daily, and never failed to scan closely
certain columns, illustrated with a black man running away with a bundle
on his back. Many of these popular illustrations and advertisements were
preserved, many others were sent away to friends at a distance, who took
a special interest in the U.G.R.R. matters. Friends and stockholders in
England used to take a great interest in seeing how the fine arts, in
these particulars, were encouraged in the South ("the land of
chivalry").

HENRY PREDO.


BROKE JAIL, JUMPED OUT OF THE WINDOW AND MADE HIS ESCAPE.


Henry fled from Buckstown, Dorchester Co., Md., March, 1857. Physically
he is a giant. About 27 years of age, stout and well-made, quite black,
and no fool, as will appear presently. Only a short time before he
escaped, his master threatened to sell him south. To avoid that fate,
therefore, he concluded to try his luck on the Underground Rail Road,
and, in company with seven others--two of them females--he started for
Canada. For two or three days and nights they managed to outgeneral all
their adversaries, and succeeded bravely in making the best of their way
to a Free State.

In the meantime, however, a reward of $3,000 was offered for their
arrest. This temptation was too great to be resisted, even by the man
who had been intrusted with the care of them, and who had faithfully
promised to pilot them to a safe place. One night, through the treachery
of their pretended conductor, they were all taken into Dover Jail, where
the Sheriff and several others, who had been notified beforehand by the
betrayer, were in readiness to receive them. Up stairs they were taken,
the betrayer remarking as they were going up, that they were "cold, but
would soon have a good warming." On a light being lit they discovered
the iron bars and the fact that they had been betrayed. Their
liberty-loving spirits and purposes, however, did not quail. Though
resisted brutally by the sheriff with revolver in hand, they made their
way down one flight of stairs, and in the moment of excitement, as good
luck would have it, plunged into the sheriff's private apartment, where
his wife and children were sleeping. The wife cried murder lustily. A
shovel full of fire, to the great danger of burning the premises, was
scattered over the room; out of the window jumped two of the female
fugitives. Our hero Henry, seizing a heavy andiron, smashed out the
window entire, through which the others leaped a distance of twelve
feet. The railing or wall around the jail, though at first it looked
forbidding, was soon surmounted by a desperate effort.

At this stage of the proceedings, Henry found himself without the walls,
and also lost sight of his comrades at the same time. The last enemy he
spied was the sheriff in his stockings without his shoes. He snapped his
pistol at him, but it did not go off. Six of the others, however,
marvellously got off safely together; where the eighth went, or how he
got off, was not known.

DANIEL HUGHES.


Daniel fled from Buckstown, Dorchester Co., also. His owner's name was
Richard Meredith, a farmer. Daniel is one of the eight alluded to above.
In features he is well made, dark chestnut color, and intelligent,
possessing an ardent thirst for liberty. The cause of his escape was:
"Worked hard in all sorts of weather--in rain and snow," so he thought
he would "go where colored men are free." His master was considered the
hardest man around. His mistress was "eighty-three years of age," "drank
hard," was "very stormy," and a "member of the Methodist Church" (Airy's
meeting-house). He left brothers and sisters, and uncles and aunts
behind. In the combat at the prison he played his part manfully.

THOMAS ELLIOTT.


Thomas is also one of the brave eight who broke out of Dover Jail. He
was about twenty-three years of age, well made, wide awake, and of a
superb black complexion. He too had been owned by Richard Meredith.
Against the betrayer, who was a black man, he had vengeance in store if
the opportunity should ever offer. Thomas left only one brother living;
his "father and mother were dead."

The excitement over the escape spread very rapidly next morning, and
desperate efforts were made to recapture the fugitives, but a few
friends there were who had sympathy and immediately rendered them the
needed assistance.

The appended note from the faithful Garrett to Samuel Rhoads, may throw
light upon the occurrence to some extent.


    WILMINGTON, 3d mo. 13th, 1857.

    DEAR COUSIN, SAMUEL RHOADS:--I have a letter this day from an
    agent of the Underground Rail Road, near Dover, in this state,
    saying I must be on the look out for six brothers and two
    sisters, they were decoyed and betrayed, he says by a colored
    man named Thomas Otwell, who pretended to be their friend, and
    sent a _white scamp_ ahead to wait for them at Dover till they
    arrived; they were arrested and put in Jail there, with Tom's
    assistance, and some officers. On third day morning about four
    o'clock, they broke jail; six of them are secreted in the
    neighborhood, and the writer has not known what became of the
    other two. The six were to start last night for this place. I
    hear that their owners have persons stationed at several places
    on the road watching. I fear they will be taken. If they could
    lay quiet for ten days or two weeks, they might then get up
    safe. I shall have two men sent this evening some four or five
    miles below to keep them away from this town, and send them (if
    found to Chester County). Thee may show this to Still and McKim,
    and oblige thy cousin,

    THOMAS GARRETT.


Further light about this exciting contest, may be gathered from a
colored conductor on the Road, in Delaware, who wrote as follows to a
member of the Vigilance Committee at Philadelphia.

The balance of these brave fugitives, although not named in this
connection, succeeded in getting off safely. But how the betrayer,
sheriff and hunters got out of their dilemma, the Committee was never
fully posted.

The Committee found great pleasure in assisting these passengers, for
they had the true grit. Such were always doubly welcome.

MARY EPPS, ALIAS EMMA BROWN--JOSEPH AND ROBERT ROBINSON.


A SLAVE MOTHER LOSES HER SPEECH AT THE SALE OF HER CHILD--BOB ESCAPES
FROM HIS MASTER, A TRADER, WITH $1500 IN NORTH CAROLINA MONEY.


Mary fled from Petersburg and the Robinsons from Richmond. A fugitive
slave law-breaking captain by the name of B., who owned a schooner, and
would bring any kind of freight that would pay the most, was the
conductor in this instance. Quite a number of passengers at different
times availed themselves of his accommodations and thus succeeded in
reaching Canada.

His risk was very great. On this account he claimed, as did certain
others, that it was no more than fair to charge for his services--indeed
he did not profess to bring persons for nothing, except in rare
instances. In this matter the Committee did not feel disposed to
interfere directly in any way, further than to suggest that whatever
understanding was agreed upon by the parties themselves should be
faithfully adhered to.

Many slaves in cities could raise, "by hook or by crook," fifty or one
hundred dollars to pay for a passage, providing they could find one who
was willing to risk aiding them. Thus, while the Vigilance Committee of
Philadelphia especially neither charged nor accepted anything for their
services, it was not to be expected that any of the Southern agents
could afford to do likewise.

The husband of Mary had for a long time wanted his own freedom, but did
not feel that he could go without his wife; in fact, he resolved to get
her off first, then to try and escape himself, if possible. The first
essential step towards success, he considered, was to save his money and
make it an object to the captain to help him. So when he had managed to
lay by one hundred dollars, he willingly offered this sum to Captain B.,
if he would engage to deliver his wife into the hands of the Vigilance
Committee of Philadelphia. The captain agreed to the terms and fulfilled
his engagement to the letter. About the 1st of March, 1855, Mary was
presented to the Vigilance Committee. She was of agreeable manners,
about forty-five years of age, dark complexion, round built, and
intelligent. She had been the mother of fifteen children, four of whom
had been sold away from her; one was still held in slavery in
Petersburg; the others were all dead.

At the sale of one of her children she was so affected with grief that
she was thrown into violent convulsions, which caused the loss of her
speech for one entire month. But this little episode was not a matter to
excite sympathy in the breasts of the highly refined and tender-hearted
Christian mothers of Petersburg. In the mercy of Providence, however,
her reason and strength returned.

She had formerly belonged to the late Littleton Reeves, whom she
represented as having been "kind" to her, much more so than her mistress
(Mrs. Reeves). Said Mary, "She being of a jealous disposition, caused me
to be hired out with a hard family, where I was much abused, frequently
flogged, and stinted for food," etc.

But the sweets of freedom in the care of the Vigilance Committee now
delighted her mind, and the hope that her husband would soon follow her
to Canada, inspired her with expectations that she would one day "sit
under her own vine and fig tree where none dared to molest or make her
afraid."

The Committee rendered her the usual assistance, and in due time,
forwarded her on to Queen Victoria's free land in Canada. On her arrival
she wrote back as follows--


    TORONTO, March 14th, 1855.

    DEAR MR. STILL:--I take this opportunity of addressing you with
    these few lines to inform you that I arrived here to-day, and
    hope that this may find yourself and Mrs. Still well, as this
    leaves me at the present. I will also say to you, that I had no
    difficulty in getting along. the two young men that was with me
    left me at Suspension Bridge. they went another way.

    I cannot say much about the place as I have ben here but a short
    time but so far as I have seen I like very well. you will give
    my Respect to your lady, & Mr & Mrs Brown. If you have not
    written to Petersburg you will please to write as soon as can I
    have nothing More to Write at present but yours Respectfully

    EMMA BROWN (old name MARY EPPS).


Now, Joseph and Robert (Mary's associate passengers from Richmond) must
here be noticed. Joseph was of a dark orange color, medium size, very
active and intelligent, and doubtless, well understood the art of
behaving himself. He was well acquainted with the auction block--having
been sold three times, and had had the misfortune to fall into the hands
of a cruel master each time. Under these circumstances he had had but
few privileges. Sundays and week days alike he was kept pretty severely
bent down to duty. He had been beaten and knocked around shamefully. He
had a wife, and spoke of her in most endearing language, although, on
leaving, he did not feel at liberty to apprise her of his movements,
"fearing that it would not be safe so to do." His four little children,
to whom he appeared warmly attached, he left as he did his wife--in
Slavery. He declared that he "stuck to them as long as he could." George
E. Sadler, the keeper of an oyster house, held the deed for "Joe," and a
most heartless wretch he was in Joe's estimation. The truth was, Joe
could not stand the burdens and abuses which Sadler was inclined to heap
upon him. So he concluded to join his brother and go off on the U.G.R.R.

Robert, his younger brother, was owned by Robert Slater, Esq., a regular
negro trader. Eight years this slave's duties had been at the slave
prison, and among other daily offices he had to attend to, was to lock
up the prison, prepare the slaves for sale, etc. Robert was a very
intelligent young man, and from long and daily experience with the
customs and usages of the slave prison, he was as familiar with the
business as a Pennsylvania farmer with his barn-yard stock. His account
of things was too harrowing for detail here, except in the briefest
manner, and that only with reference to a few particulars. In order to
prepare slaves for the market, it was usual to have them greased and
rubbed to make them look bright and shining. And he went on further to
state, that "females as well as males were not uncommonly stripped
naked, lashed flat to a bench, and then held by two men, sometimes four,
while the brutal trader would strap them with a broad leather strap."
The strap being preferred to the cow-hide, as it would not break the
skin, and damage the sale. "One hundred lashes would only be a common
flogging." The separation of families was thought nothing of. "Often I
have been flogged for refusing to flog others." While not yet
twenty-three years of age, Robert expressed himself as having become so
daily sick of the brutality and suffering he could not help witnessing,
that he felt he could not possibly stand it any longer, let the cost be
what it might. In this state of mind he met with Captain B. Only one
obstacle stood in his way--material aid. It occurred to Robert that he
had frequent access to the money drawer, and often it contained the
proceeds of fresh sales of flesh and blood; and he reasoned that if some
of that would help him and his brother to freedom, there could be no
harm in helping himself the first opportunity.

The captain was all ready, and provided he could get three passengers at
$100 each he would set sail without much other freight. Of course he was
too shrewd to get out papers for Philadelphia. That would betray him at
once. Washington or Baltimore, or even Wilmington, Del., were names
which stood fair in the eyes of Virginia. Consequently, being able to
pack the fugitives away in a very private hole of his boat, and being
only bound for a Southern port, the captain was willing to risk his
share of the danger. "Very well," said Robert, "to-day I will please my
master so well, that I will catch him at an unguarded moment, and will
ask him for a pass to go to a ball to-night (slave-holders love to see
their slaves fiddling and dancing of nights), and as I shall be leaving
in a hurry, I will take a grab from the day's sale, and when Slater
hears of me again, I will be in Canada." So after having attended to all
his disagreeable duties, he made his "grab," and got a hand full. He did
not know, however, how it would hold out. That evening, instead of
participating with the gay dancers, he was just one degree lower down
than the regular bottom of Captain B's. deck, with several hundred
dollars in his pocket, after paying the worthy captain one hundred each
for himself and his brother, besides making the captain an additional
present of nearly one hundred. Wind and tide were now what they prayed
for to speed on the U.G.R.R. schooner, until they might reach the depot
at Philadelphia.

The Richmond _Dispatch_, an enterprising paper in the interest of
slaveholders, which came daily to the Committee, was received in advance
of the passengers, when lo! and behold, in turning to the interesting
column containing the elegant illustrations of "runaway negroes," it was
seen that the unfortunate Slater had "lost $1500 in North Carolina
money, and also his dark orange-colored, intelligent, and good-looking
turnkey, Bob." "Served him right, it is no stealing for one piece of
property to go off with another piece," reasoned a member of the
Committee.

In a couple of days after the Dispatch brought the news, the three
U.G.R.R. passengers were safely landed at the usual place, and so
accurate were the descriptions in the paper, that, on first seeing them,
the Committee recognized them instantly, and, without any previous
ceremonies, read to them the advertisement relative to the "$1500 in
N.C. money, &c.," and put the question to them direct: "Are you the
ones?" "We are," they owned up without hesitation. The Committee did not
see a dollar of their money, but understood they had about $900, after
paying the captain; while Bob considered he made a "very good grab," he
did not admit that the amount advertised was correct. After a reasonable
time for recruiting, having been so long in the hole of the vessel, they
took their departure for Canada.

From Joseph, the elder brother, is appended a short letter, announcing
their arrival and condition under the British Lion--


    SAINT CATHARINE, April 16, 1855.

    MR. WILLIAM STILL, DEAR SIR:--Your letter of date April 7th I
    have just got, it had been opened before it came to me. I have
    not received any other letter from you and can get no account of
    them in the Post Office in this place, I am well and have got a
    good situation in this city and intend staying here. I should be
    very glad to hear from you as soon as convenient and also from
    all of my friends near you. My Brother is also at work with me
    and doing well.

    There is nothing here that would interest you in the way of
    news. There is a Masonic Lodge of our people and two churches
    and societys here and some other institutions for our benefit.
    Be kind enough to send a few lines to the Lady spoken of for
    that mocking bird and much oblige me. Write me soon and believe
    me your obedient Serv't

    Love & respects to Lady and daughter

    JOSEPH ROBINSON.


As well as writing to a member of the Committee, Joe and Bob had the
assurance to write back to the trader and oyster-house keeper. In their
letter they stated that they had arrived safely in Canada, and were
having good times,--in the eating line had an abundance of the
best,--also had very choice wines and brandies, which they supposed that
they (trader and oyster-house keeper) would give a great deal to have a
"smack at." And then they gave them a very cordial invitation to make
them a visit, and suggested that the quickest way they could come, would
be by telegraph, which they admitted was slightly dangerous, and without
first greasing themselves, and then hanging on very fast, the journey
might not prove altogether advantageous to them. This was wormwood and
gall to the trader and oyster-house man. A most remarkable coincidence
was that, about the time this letter was received in Richmond, the
captain who brought away the three passengers, made it his business for
some reason or other, to call at the oyster-house kept by the owner of
Joe, and while there, this letter was read and commented on in torrents
of Billingsgate phrases; and the trader told the captain that he would
give him "two thousand dollars if he would get them;" finally he told
him he would "give every cent they would bring, which would be much over
$2000," as they were "so very likely." How far the captain talked
approvingly, he did not exactly tell the Committee, but they guessed he
talked strong Democratic doctrine to them under the frightful
circumstances. But he was good at concealing his feelings, and obviously
managed to avoid suspicion.

GEORGE SOLOMON, DANIEL NEALL, BENJAMIN R. FLETCHER AND MARIA DORSEY.


The above representatives of the unrequited laborers of the South fled
directly from Washington, D.C. Nothing remarkable was discovered in
their stories of slave life; their narratives will therefore be brief.

George Solomon was owned by Daniel Minor, of Moss Grove, Va. George was
about thirty-three years of age; mulatto, intelligent, and of
prepossessing appearance. His old master valued George's services very
highly, and had often declared to others, as well as to George himself,
that without him he should hardly know how to manage. And frequently
George was told by the old master that at his "death he was not to be a
slave any longer, as he would have provision made in his will for his
freedom." For a long time this old story was clung to pretty faithfully
by George, but his "old master hung on too long," consequently George's
patience became exhausted. And as he had heard a good deal about Canada,
U.G.R.R., and the Abolitionists, he concluded that it would do no harm
to hint to a reliable friend or two the names of these hard places and
bad people, to see what impression would be made on their minds; in
short, to see if they were ready to second a motion to get rid of
bondage. In thus opening his mind to his friends, he soon found a
willing accord in each of their hearts, and they put their heads
together to count up the cost and to fix a time for leaving Egypt and
the host of Pharaoh to do their own "hewing of wood and drawing of
water." Accordingly George, Daniel, Benjamin and Maria, all of one heart
and mind, one "Saturday night" resolved that the next Sunday should find
them on the U.G.R.R., with their faces towards Canada.

Daniel was young, only twenty-three, good looking, and half white, with
a fair share of intelligence. As regards his slave life, he acknowledged
that he had not had it very rough as a general thing; nevertheless, he
was fully persuaded that he had "as good a right to his freedom" as his
"master had to his," and that it was his duty to contend for it.

Benjamin was twenty-seven years of age, small of stature, dark
complexion, of a pleasant countenance, and quite smart. He testified,
that "ill-treatment from his master," Henry Martin, who would give him
"no chance at all," was the cause of his leaving. He left a brother and
sister, belonging to Martin, besides he left two other sisters in
bondage, Louisa and Letty, but his father and mother were both dead.
Therefore, the land of slave-whips and auction-blocks had no charms for
him. He loved his sisters, but he knew if he could not protect himself,
much less could he protect them. So he concluded to bid them adieu
forever in this world.

Turning from the three male companions for the purpose of finding a
brief space for Maria, it will be well to state here that females in
attempting to escape from a life of bondage undertook three times the
risk of failure that males were liable to, not to mention the additional
trials and struggles they had to contend with. In justice, therefore, to
the heroic female who was willing to endure the most extreme suffering
and hardship for freedom, double honors were due.

Maria, the heroine of the party, was about forty years of age, chestnut
color, medium size, and possessed of a good share of common sense. She
was owned by George Parker. As was a common thing with slave-holders,
Maria had found her owners hard to please, and quite often, without the
slightest reason, they would threaten to "sell or make a change." These
threats only made matters worse, or rather it only served to nerve Maria
for the conflict. The party walked almost the entire distance from
Washington to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.

In the meantime George Parker, the so-called owner of Daniel and Maria,
hurriedly rushed their good names into the "Baltimore Sun," after the
following manner--


    "FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD.--Ranaway from my house on Saturday
    night, August 30, my negro man 'Daniel,' twenty-five years of
    age, bright yellow mulatto, thick set and stout made.

    Also, my negro woman, 'Maria,' forty years of age, bright
    mulatto. The above reward will be paid if delivered in
    Washington city. GEORGE PARKER."


While this advertisement was in the Baltimore papers, doubtless these
noble passengers were enjoying the hospitalities of the Vigilance
Committee, and finally a warm reception in Canada, by which they were
greatly pleased. Of Benjamin and Daniel, the subjoined letter from Rev.
H. Wilson is of importance in the way of throwing light upon their
whereabouts in Canada:


    ST. CATHARINE, C.W., Sept. 15th, 1856.

    MR. WILLIAM STILL:--_Dear Sir_--Two young men arrived here on
    Friday evening last from Washington, viz: Benjamin R. Fletcher
    and Daniel Neall. Mr. Neall (or Neale) desires to have his box
    of clothing forwarded on to him. It is at Washington in the care
    of John Dade, a colored man, who lives at Doct. W.H. Gilman's,
    who keeps an Apothecary store on the corner of 4-1/2 and
    Pennsylvania Avenue. Mr. Dade is a slave, but a free dealer. You
    will please write to John Dade, in the care of Doct. W.H.
    Gilman, on behalf of Daniel Neale, but make use of the name of
    George Harrison, instead of Neale, and Dade will understand it.
    Please have John Dade direct the box by express to you in
    Philadelphia; he has the means of paying the charges on it in
    advance, as far as Philadelphia; and as soon as it comes, you
    will please forward it on to my care at St. Catherine. Say to
    John Dade, that George Harrison sends his love to his sister and
    Uncle Allen Sims, and all inquiring friends. Mr. Fletcher and
    Mr. Neale both send their respects to you, and I may add mine.

    Yours truly,

    HIRAM WILSON.

    P.S.--Mr. Benjamin R. Fletcher wishes to have Mr. Dade call on
    his brother James, and communicate to him his affectionate
    regards, and make known to him that he is safe, and cheerful and
    happy. He desires his friends to know, through Dade, that he
    found Mrs. Starke here, his brother Alfred's wife's sister; that
    she is well, and living in St. Catharine, C.W., near Niagara
    Palls.    H.W.

HENRY BOX BROWN.


ARRIVED BY ADAMS' EXPRESS.


Although the name of Henry Box Brown has been echoed over the land for a
number of years, and the simple facts connected with his marvelous
escape from slavery in a box published widely through the medium of
anti-slavery papers, nevertheless it is not unreasonable to suppose that
very little is generally known in relation to this case.

Briefly, the facts are these, which doubtless have never before been
fully published--

Brown was a man of invention as well as a hero. In point of interest,
however, his case is no more remarkable than many others. Indeed,
neither before nor after escaping did he suffer one-half what many
others have experienced.

He was decidedly an unhappy piece of property in the city of Richmond,
Va. In the condition of a slave he felt that it would be impossible for
him to remain. Full well did he know, however, that it was no holiday
task to escape the vigilance of Virginia slave-hunters, or the wrath of
an enraged master for committing the unpardonable sin of attempting to
escape to a land of liberty. So Brown counted well the cost before
venturing upon this hazardous undertaking. Ordinary modes of travel he
concluded might prove disastrous to his hopes; he, therefore, hit upon a
new invention altogether, which was to have himself boxed up and
forwarded to Philadelphia direct by express. The size of the box and how
it was to be made to fit him most comfortably, was of his own ordering.
Two feet eight inches deep, two feet wide, and three feet long were the
exact dimensions of the box, lined with baize. His resources with regard
to food and water consisted of the following: One bladder of water and a
few small biscuits. His mechanical implement to meet the death-struggle
for fresh air, all told, was one large gimlet. Satisfied that it would
be far better to peril his life for freedom in this way than to remain
under the galling yoke of Slavery, he entered his box, which was safely
nailed up and hooped with five hickory hoops, and was then addressed by
his next friend, James A. Smith, a shoe dealer, to Wm. H. Johnson, Arch
street, Philadelphia, marked, "This side up with care." In this
condition he was sent to Adams' Express office in a dray, and thence by
overland express to Philadelphia. It was twenty-six hours from the time
he left Richmond until his arrival in the City of Brotherly Love. The
notice, "This side up, &c.," did not avail with the different
expressmen, who hesitated not to handle the box in the usual rough
manner common to this class of men. For a while they actually had the
box upside down, and had him on his head for miles. A few days before he
was expected, certain intimation was conveyed to a member of the
Vigilance Committee that a box might be expected by the three o'clock
morning train from the South, which might contain a man. One of the most
serious walks he ever took--and they had not been a few--to meet and
accompany passengers, he took at half past two o'clock that morning to
the depot. Not once, but for more than a score of times, he fancied the
slave would be dead. He anxiously looked while the freight was being
unloaded from the cars, to see if he could recognize a box that might
contain a man; one alone had that appearance, and he confessed it really
seemed as if there was the scent of death about it. But on inquiry, he
soon learned that it was not the one he was looking after, and he was
free to say he experienced a marked sense of relief. That same
afternoon, however, he received from Richmond a telegram, which read
thus, "Your case of goods is shipped and will arrive to-morrow morning."

At this exciting juncture of affairs, Mr. McKim, who had been
engineering this important undertaking, deemed it expedient to change
the programme slightly in one particular at least to insure greater
safety. Instead of having a member of the Committee go again to the
depot for the box, which might excite suspicion, it was decided that it
would be safest to have the express bring it direct to the Anti-Slavery
Office.

But all apprehension of danger did not now disappear, for there was no
room to suppose that Adams' Express office had any sympathy with the
Abolitionist or the fugitive, consequently for Mr. McKim to appear
personally at the express office to give directions with reference to
the coming of a box from Richmond which would be directed to Arch
street, and yet not intended for that street, but for the Anti-Slavery
office at 107 North Fifth street, it needed of course no great
discernment to foresee that a step of this kind was wholly impracticable
and that a more indirect and covert method would have to be adopted. In
this dreadful crisis Mr. McKim, with his usual good judgment and
remarkably quick, strategical mind, especially in matters pertaining to
the U.G.R.R., hit upon the following plan, namely, to go to his friend,
E.M. Davis,[A] who was then extensively engaged in mercantile business,
and relate the circumstances. Having daily intercourse with said Adams'
Express office, and being well acquainted with the firm and some of the
drivers, Mr. Davis could, as Mr. McKim thought, talk about "boxes,
freight, etc.," from any part of the country without risk. Mr. Davis
heard Mr. McKim's plan and instantly approved of it, and was heartily at
his service.

[Footnote A: E.M. Davis was a member of the Executive Committee of the
Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society and a long-tried Abolitionist,
son-in-law of James and Lucretia Mott.]

[Illustration: RESURRECTION OF HENRY BOX BROWN.]

"Dan, an Irishman, one of Adams' Express drivers, is just the fellow to
go to the depot after the box," said Davis. "He drinks a little too much
whiskey sometimes, but he will do anything I ask him to do, promptly and
obligingly. I'll trust Dan, for I believe he is the very man." The
difficulty which Mr. McKim had been so anxious to overcome was thus
pretty well settled. It was agreed that Dan should go after the box next
morning before daylight and bring it to the Anti-Slavery office direct,
and to make it all the more agreeable for Dan to get up out of his warm
bed and go on this errand before day, it was decided that he should have
a five dollar gold piece for himself. Thus these preliminaries having
been satisfactorily arranged, it only remained for Mr. Davis to see Dan
and give him instructions accordingly, etc.

Next morning, according to arrangement, the box was at the Anti-Slavery
office in due time. The witnesses present to behold the resurrection
were J.M. McKim, Professor C.D. Cleveland, Lewis Thompson, and the
writer.

Mr. McKim was deeply interested; but having been long identified with
the Anti-Slavery cause as one of its oldest and ablest advocates in the
darkest days of slavery and mobs, and always found by the side of the
fugitive to counsel and succor, he was on this occasion perfectly
composed.

Professor Cleveland, however, was greatly moved. His zeal and
earnestness in the cause of freedom, especially in rendering aid to
passengers, knew no limit. Ordinarily he could not too often visit these
travelers, shake them too warmly by the hand, or impart to them too
freely of his substance to aid them on their journey. But now his
emotion was overpowering.

Mr. Thompson, of the firm of Merrihew & Thompson--about the only
printers in the city who for many years dared to print such incendiary
documents as anti-slavery papers and pamphlets--one of the truest
friends of the slave, was composed and prepared to witness the scene.

All was quiet. The door had been safely locked. The proceedings
commenced. Mr. McKim rapped quietly on the lid of the box and called
out, "All right!" Instantly came the answer from within, "All right,
sir!"

The witnesses will never forget that moment. Saw and hatchet quickly had
the five hickory hoops cut and the lid off, and the marvellous
resurrection of Brown ensued. Rising up in his box, he reached out his
hand, saying, "How do you do, gentlemen?" The little assemblage hardly
knew what to think or do at the moment. He was about as wet as if he had
come up out of the Delaware. Very soon he remarked that, before leaving
Richmond he had selected for his arrival-hymn (if he lived) the Psalm
beginning with these words: "_I waited patiently for the Lord, and He
heard my prayer_." And most touchingly did he sing the psalm, much to
his own relief, as well as to the delight of his small audience.

He was then christened Henry Box Brown, and soon afterwards was sent to
the hospitable residence of James Mott and E.M. Davis, on Ninth street,
where, it is needless to say, he met a most cordial reception from Mrs.
Lucretia Mott and her household. Clothing and creature comforts were
furnished in abundance, and delight and joy filled all hearts in that
stronghold of philanthropy.

As he had been so long doubled up in the box he needed to promenade
considerably in the fresh air, so James Mott put one of his broad-brim
hats on his head and tendered him the hospitalities of his yard as well
as his house, and while Brown promenaded the yard flushed with victory,
great was the joy of his friends.

After his visit at Mr. Mott's, he spent two days with the writer, and
then took his departure for Boston, evidently feeling quite conscious of
the wonderful feat he had performed, and at the same time it may be
safely said that those who witnessed this strange resurrection were not
only elated at his success, but were made to sympathize more deeply than
ever before with the slave. Also the noble-hearted Smith who boxed him
up was made to rejoice over Brown's victory, and was thereby encouraged
to render similar service to two other young bondmen, who appealed to
him for deliverance. But, unfortunately, in this attempt the undertaking
proved a failure. Two boxes containing the young men alluded to above,
after having been duly expressed and some distance on the road, were,
through the agency of the telegraph, betrayed, and the heroic young
fugitives were captured in their boxes and dragged back to hopeless
bondage. Consequently, through this deplorable failure, Samuel A. Smith
was arrested, imprisoned, and was called upon to suffer severely, as may
be seen from the subjoined correspondence, taken from the New York
Tribune soon after his release from the penitentiary.



THE DELIVERER OF BOX BROWN--MEETING OF THE COLORED CITIZENS OF
PHILADELPHIA.



    [Correspondence of the N.Y. Tribune.]

    PHILADELPHIA, Saturday, July 5, 1856.

    Samuel A. Smith, who boxed up Henry Box Brown in Richmond, Va.,
    and forwarded him by overland express to Philadelphia, and who
    was arrested and convicted, eight years ago, for boxing up two
    other slaves, also directed to Philadelphia, having served out
    his imprisonment in the Penitentiary, was released on the 18th
    ultimo, and arrived in this city on the 21st.

    Though he lost all his property; though he was refused witnesses
    on his trial (no officer could be found, who would serve a
    summons on a witness); though for five long months, in hot
    weather, he was kept heavily chained in a cell four by eight
    feet in dimensions; though he received five dreadful stabs,
    aimed at his heart, by a bribed assassin, nevertheless he still
    rejoices in the motives which prompted him to "undo the heavy
    burdens, and let the oppressed go free." Having resided nearly
    all his life in the South, where he had traveled and seen much
    of the "peculiar institution," and had witnessed the most horrid
    enormities inflicted upon the slave, whose cries were ever
    ringing in his ears, and for whom he had the warmest sympathy,
    Mr. Smith could not refrain from believing that the black man,
    as well as the white, had God-given rights. Consequently, he was
    not accustomed to shed tears when a poor creature escaped ftom
    his "kind master;" nor was he willing to turn a deaf ear to his
    appeals and groans, when he knew he was thirsting for freedom.
    From 1828 up to the day he was incarcerated, many had sought his
    aid and counsel, nor had they sought in vain. In various places
    he operated with success. In Richmond, however, it seemed
    expedient to invent a new plan for certain emergencies, hence
    the Box and Express plan was devised, at the instance of a few
    heroic slaves, who had manifested their willingness to die in a
    box, on the road to liberty, rather than continue longer under
    the yoke. But these heroes fell into the power of their enemies.
    Mr. Smith had not been long in the Penitentiary before he had
    fully gained the esteem and confidence of the Superintendent and
    other officers. Finding him to be humane and
    generous-hearted--showing kindness toward all, especially in
    buying bread, &c., for the starving prisoners, and by a timely
    note of warning, which had saved the life of one of the keepers,
    for whose destruction a bold plot had been arranged--the
    officers felt disposed to show him such favors as the law would
    allow. But their good intentions were soon frustrated. The
    Inquisition (commonly called the Legislature), being in session
    in Richmond, hearing that the Superintendent had been speaking
    well of Smith, and circulating a petition for his pardon,
    indignantly demanded to know if the rumor was well founded. Two
    weeks were spent by the Inquisition, and many witnesses were
    placed upon oath, to solemnly testify in the matter. One of the
    keepers swore that his life had been saved by Smith. Col.
    Morgan, the Superintendent, frequently testified in writing and
    verbally to Smith's good deportment; acknowledging that he had
    circulated petitions, &c.; and took the position, that he
    sincerely believed, that it would be to the interest of the
    institution to pardon him; calling the attention of the
    Inquisition, at the same time, to the fact, that not
    unfrequently pardons had been granted to criminals, under
    sentence of death, for the most cold-blooded murder, to say
    nothing of other gross crimes. The effort for pardon was soon
    abandoned, for the following reason given by the Governor: "I
    can't, and I won't pardon him!"

    In view of the unparalleled injustice which Mr. S. had suffered,
    as well as on account of the aid he had rendered to the slaves,
    on his arrival in this city the colored citizens of Philadelphia
    felt that he was entitled to sympathy and aid, and straightway
    invited him to remain a few days, until arrangements could be
    made for a mass meeting to receive him. Accordingly, on last
    Monday evening, a mass meeting convened in the Israel church,
    and the Rev. Wm. T. Catto was called to the chair, and Wm. Still
    was appointed secretary. The chairman briefly stated the object
    of the meeting. Having lived in the South, he claimed to know
    something of the workings of the oppressive system of slavery
    generally, and declared that, notwithstanding the many exposures
    of the evil which came under his own observation, the most vivid
    descriptions fell far short of the realities his own eyes had
    witnessed. He then introduced Mr. Smith, who arose and in a
    plain manner briefly told his story, assuring the audience that
    he had always hated slavery, and had taken great pleasure in
    helping many out of it, and though he had suffered much
    physically and pecuniarily for the cause' sake, yet he murmured
    not, but rejoiced in what he had done. After taking his seat,
    addresses were made by the Rev. S. Smith, Messrs. Kinnard,
    Brunner, Bradway, and others. The following preamble and
    resolutions were adopted--


        WHEREAS, We, the colored citizens of Philadelphia, have
        among us Samuel A. Smith, who was incarcerated over
        seven years in the Richmond Penitentiary, for doing an
        act that was honorable to his feelings and his sense of
        justice and humanity, therefore,

        _Resolved_, That we welcome him to this city as a martyr
        to the cause of Freedom.

        _Resolved_, That we heartily tender him our gratitude
        for the good he has done to our suffering race.

        _Resolved_, That we sympathize with him in his losses
        and sufferings in the cause of the poor, down-trodden
        slave.

        W.S.



During his stay in Philadelphia, on this occasion, he stopped for about
a fortnight with the writer, and it was most gratifying to learn from
him that he was no new worker on the U.G.R.R. But that he had long hated
slavery thoroughly, and although surrounded with perils on every side,
he had not failed to help a poor slave whenever the opportunity was
presented.

Pecuniary aid, to some extent, was rendered him in this city, for which
he was grateful, and after being united in marriage, by Wm. H. Furness,
D.D., to a lady who had remained faithful to him through all his sore
trials and sufferings, he took his departure for Western New York, with
a good conscience and an unshaken faith in the belief that in aiding his
fellow-man to freedom he had but simply obeyed the word of Him who
taught man to do unto others as he would be done by.

TRIAL OF THE EMANCIPATORS OF COL. J.H. WHEELER'S SLAVES, JANE JOHNSON
AND HER TWO LITTLE BOYS.


Among other duties devolving on the Vigilance Committee when hearing of
slaves brought into the State by their owners, was immediately to inform
such persons that as they were not fugitives, but were brought into the
State by their masters, they were entitled to their freedom without
another moment's service, and that they could have the assistance of the
Committee and the advice of counsel without charge, by simply availing
themselves of these proffered favors.

Many slave-holders fully understood the law in this particular, and were
also equally posted with regard to the vigilance of abolitionists.
Consequently they avoided bringing slaves beyond Mason and Dixon's Line
in traveling North. But some slave-holders were not thus mindful of the
laws, or were too arrogant to take heed, as may be seen in the case of
Colonel John H. Wheeler, of North Carolina, the United States Minister
to Nicaragua. In passing through Philadelphia from Washington, one very
warm July day in 1855, accompanied by three of his slaves, his high
official equilibrium, as well as his assumed rights under the
Constitution, received a terrible shock at the hands of the Committee.
Therefore, for the readers of these pages, and in order to completely
illustrate the various phases of the work of the Committee in the days
of Slavery, this case, selected from many others, is a fitting one.
However, for more than a brief recital of some of the more prominent
incidents, it will not be possible to find room in this volume. And,
indeed, the necessity of so doing is precluded by the fact that Mr.
Williamson in justice to himself and the cause of freedom, with great
pains and singular ability, gathered the most important facts bearing on
his memorable trial and imprisonment, and published them in a neat
volume for historical reference.

In order to bring fully before the reader the beginning of this
interesting and exciting case, it seems only necessary to publish the
subjoined letter, written by one of the actors in the drama, and
addressed to the New York Tribune, and an additional paragraph which may
be requisite to throw light on a special point, which Judge Kane decided
was concealed in the "obstinate" breast of Passmore Williamson, as said
Williamson persistently refused before the said Judge's court, to own
that he had a knowledge of the mystery in question. After which, a brief
glance at some of the more important points of the case must suffice.



LETTER COPIED FROM THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE.



    [Correspondence of The N.Y. Tribune.]

    PHILADELPHIA, Monday, July 30, 1855.

    As the public have not been made acquainted with the facts and
    particulars respecting the agency of Mr. Passmore Williamson and
    others, in relation to the slave case now agitating this city,
    and especially as the poor slave mother and her two sons have
    been so grossly misrepresented, I deem it my duty to lay the
    facts before you, for publication or otherwise, as you may think
    proper.

    On Wednesday afternoon, week, at 4-1/2 o'clock, the following
    note was placed in my hands by a colored boy whom I had never
    before seen, to my recollection:

    "MR. STILL--_Sir_: Will you come down to Bloodgood's Hotel as
    soon as possible--as there are three fugitive slaves here and
    they want liberty. Their master is here with them, on his way to
    New York."

    The note was without date, and the signature so indistinctly
    written as not to be understood by me, having evidently been
    penned in a moment of haste.

    Without delay I ran with the note to Mr. P. Williamson's office,
    Seventh and Arch, found him at his desk, and gave it to him, and
    after reading it, he remarked that he could not go down, as he
    had to go to Harrisburg that night on business--but he advised
    me to go, and to get the names of the slave-holder and the
    slaves, in order to telegraph to New York to have them arrested
    there, as no time remained to procure a writ of habeas corpus
    here.

    I could not have been two minutes in Mr. W.'s office before
    starting in haste for the wharf. To my surprise, however, when I
    reached the wharf, there I found Mr. W., his mind having
    undergone a sudden change; he was soon on the spot.

    I saw three or four colored persons in the hall at Bloodgood's,
    none of whom I recognized except the boy who brought me the
    note. Before having time for making inquiry some one said they
    had gone on board the boat. "Get their description," said Mr. W.
    I instantly inquired of one of the colored persons for the
    desired description, and was told that she was "a tall, dark
    woman, with two little boys."

    Mr. W. and myself ran on board of the boat, looked among the
    passengers on the first deck, but saw them not. "They are up on
    the second deck," an unknown voice uttered. In a second we were
    in their presence. We approached the anxious-looking
    slave-mother with her two boys on her left-hand; close on her
    right sat an ill-favored white man having a cane in his hand
    which I took to be a sword-cane. (As to its being a sword-cane,
    however, I might have been mistaken.)

    The first words to the mother were: "Are you traveling?" "Yes,"
    was the prompt answer. "With whom?" She nodded her head toward
    the ill-favored man, signifying with him. Fidgeting on his seat,
    he said something, exactly what I do not now recollect. In reply
    I remarked: "Do they belong to you, Sir?" "Yes, they are in my
    charge," was his answer. Turning from him to the mother and her
    sons, in substance, and word for word, as near as I can
    remember, the following remarks were earnestly though calmly
    addressed by the individuals who rejoiced to meet them on free
    soil, and who felt unmistakably assured that they were justified
    by the laws of Pennsylvania as well as the Law of God, in
    informing them of their rights:

    "You are entitled to your freedom according to the laws of
    Pennsylvania, having been brought into the State by your owner.
    If you prefer freedom to slavery, as we suppose everybody does,
    you have the chance to accept it now. Act calmly--don't be
    frightened by your master--you are as much entitled to your
    freedom as we are, or as he is--be determined and you need have
    no fears but that you will be protected by the law. Judges have
    time and again decided cases in this city and State similar to
    yours in favor of freedom! Of course, if you want to remain a
    slave with your master, we cannot force you to leave; we only
    want to make you sensible of your rights. _Remember, if you lose
    this chance you may never get such another," etc_.

    [Illustration: RESCUE OF JANE JOHNSON AND HER CHILDREN.]

    This advice to the woman was made in the hearing of a number of
    persons present, white and colored; and one elderly white
    gentleman of genteel address, who seemed to take much interest
    in what was going on, remarked that they would have the same
    chance for their freedom in New Jersey and New York as they then
    had--seeming to sympathize with the woman, etc.

    During the few moments in which the above remarks were made, the
    slaveholder frequently interrupted--said she understood all
    about the laws making her free, and her right to leave if she
    wanted to; but contended that she did not want to leave--that
    she was on a visit to New York to see her friends--afterward
    _wished to return to her three children whom she left in
    Virginia, from whom it would be_ HARD _to separate her_.
    Furthermore, he diligently tried to constrain her to say that
    she did not want to be interfered with--that she wanted to go
    with him--that she was on a visit to New York--had children in
    the South, etc.; but the woman's desire to be free was
    altogether too strong to allow her to make a single
    acknowledgment favorable to his wishes in the matter. On the
    contrary, she repeatedly said, distinctly and firmly, "_I am not
    free, but I want my freedom_--ALWAYS _wanted to be free!! but he
    holds me_."

    While the slaveholder claimed that she belonged to him, he said
    _that she was free_! Again he said that he was _going to give
    her her freedom_, etc. When his eyes would be off of hers, such
    eagerness as her looks expressed, indicative of her entreaty
    that we would not forsake her and her little ones in their
    weakness, it had never been my lot to witness before, under any
    circumstances.

    The last bell tolled! The last moment for further delay passed!
    The arm of the woman being slightly touched, accompanied with
    the word, "Come!" she instantly arose. "Go along--go along!"
    said some, who sympathized, to the boys, at the same time taking
    hold of their arms. By this time the parties were fairly moving
    toward the stairway leading to the deck below. Instantly on
    their starting, the slave-holder rushed at the woman and her
    children, to prevent their leaving; and, if I am not mistaken,
    he simultaneously took hold of the woman and Mr. Williamson,
    which resistance on his part caused Mr. W. to take hold of him
    and set him aside quickly.

    The passengers were looking on all around, but none interfered
    in behalf of the slaveholder except one man, whom I took to be
    another slaveholder. He said harshly, "Let them alone; they are
    his _property_!'" The youngest boy, about 7 years of age--too
    young to know what these things meant--cried "Massa John! Massa
    John!" The elder boy, 11 years of age, took the matter more
    dispassionately, and the mother _quite calmly_. The mother and
    her sympathizers all moved down the stairs together in the
    presence of quite a number of spectators on the first deck and
    on the wharf, all of whom, as far as I was able to discern,
    seemed to look upon the whole affair with the greatest
    indifference. The woman and children were assisted, but not
    forced to leave. Nor were there any violence or threatenings as
    I saw or heard. The only words that I heard from any one of an
    objectionable character, were: "Knock him down; knock him down!"
    but who uttered it or who was meant I knew not, nor have I since
    been informed. However, if it was uttered by a colored man, I
    regret it, as there was not the slightest cause for such
    language, especially as the sympathies of the spectators and
    citizens seemed to justify the course pursued.

    While passing off of the wharf and down Delaware-avenue to Dock
    st., and up Dock to Front, where a carriage was procured, the
    slaveholder and one police officer were of the party, if no
    more.

    The youngest boy on being put in the carriage was told that he
    was "a fool for crying so after 'Massa John,' who would sell him
    if he ever caught him." Not another whine was heard on the
    subject.

    The carriage drove down town slowly, the horses being fatigued
    and the weather intensely hot; the inmates were put out on Tenth
    street--not at any house--after which they soon found hospitable
    friends and quietude. The excitement of the moment having passed
    by, the mother _seemed very cheerful, and rejoiced greatly that
    herself and boys had been, as she thought, so "providentially
    delivered from the house of bondage_!" For the first time in her
    life she could look upon herself and children and feel free!

    Having felt the iron in her heart for the best half of her
    days--having been sold with her children on the auction
    block--having had one of her children sold far away from her
    without hope of her seeing him again--she very naturally and
    wisely concluded to go to Canada, fearing if she remained in
    this city--as some assured her she could do with entire
    safety--that she might again find herself in the clutches of the
    tyrant from whom she had fled.

    A few items of what she related concerning the character of her
    master may be interesting to the reader--

    Within the last two years he had sold all his slaves--between
    thirty and forty in number--having purchased the present ones in
    that space of time. She said that before leaving Washington,
    coming on the cars, and at his father-in-law's in this city, a
    number of persons had told him that in bringing his slaves into
    Pennsylvania they would be free. When told at his
    father-in-law's, as she overheard it, that he "could not have
    done a worse thing," &c., he replied that "Jane would not leave
    him."

    As much, however, as he affected to have such implicit
    confidence in Jane, he scarcely allowed her to be out of his
    presence a moment while in this city. To use Jane's own
    language, he was "on her heels every minute," fearing that some
    one might get to her ears the sweet music of freedom. By the
    way, Jane had it deep in her heart before leaving the South, and
    was bent on succeeding in New York, if disappointed in
    Philadelphia.

    At Bloodgood's, after having been belated and left by the 2
    o'clock train, while waiting for the 5 o'clock line, his
    appetite tempted her "master" to take a hasty dinner. So after
    placing Jane where he thought she would be pretty secure from
    "evil communications" from the colored waiters, and after giving
    her a double counselling, he made his way to the table; remained
    but a little while, however, before leaving to look after Jane;
    finding her composed, looking over a bannister near where he
    left her, he returned to the table again and finished his meal.

    But, alas, for the slave-holder! Jane had her "top eye open,"
    and in that brief space had appealed to the sympathies of a
    person whom she ventured to trust, saying, "I and my children
    are slaves, and we want liberty!" I am not certain, but suppose
    that person, in the goodness of his heart, was the cause of the
    note being sent to the Anti-Slavery office, and hence the
    result.

    As to her going on to New York to see her friends, and wishing
    to return to her three children in the South, and his going to
    free her, &c., Jane declared repeatedly and very positively,
    that there was not a particle of truth in what her master said
    on these points. The truth is she had not the slightest hope of
    freedom through any act of his. She had only left one boy in the
    South, who had been sold far away, where she scarcely ever heard
    from him, indeed never expected to see him any more.

    In appearance Jane is tall and well formed, high and large
    forehead, of genteel manners, chestnut color, and seems to
    possess, naturally, uncommon good sense, though of course she
    has never been allowed to read.

    Thus I have given as truthful a report as I am capable of doing,
    of Jane and the circumstances connected with her deliverance.

    W. STILL.

    P.S.--Of the five colored porters who promptly appeared, with
    warm hearts throbbing in sympathy with the mother and her
    children, too much cannot be said in commendation. In the
    present case they acted nobly, whatever may be said of their
    general character, of which I know nothing. How human beings,
    who have ever tasted oppression, could have acted differently
    under the circumstances I cannot conceive.


The mystery alluded to, which the above letter did not contain, and
which the court failed to make Mr. Williamson reveal, might have been
truthfully explained in these words. The carriage was procured at the
wharf, while Col. Wheeler and Mr. Williamson were debating the question
relative to the action of the Committee, and at that instant, Jane and
her two boys were invited into it and accompanied by the writer, who
procured it, were driven down town, and on Tenth Street, below Lombard,
the inmates were invited out of it, and the said conductor paid the
driver and discharged him. For prudential reasons he took them to a
temporary resting-place, where they could tarry until after dark; then
they were invited to his own residence, where they were made welcome,
and in due time forwarded East. Now, what disposition was made of them
after they had left the wharf, while Williamson and Wheeler were
discussing matters--(as was clearly sworn to by Passmore, in his answer
to the writ of Habeas Corpus)--he Williamson did not know. That evening,
before seeing the member of the Committee, with whom he acted in concert
on the boat, and who had entire charge of Jane and her boys, he left for
Harrisburg, to fulfill business engagements. The next morning his father
(Thomas Williamson) brought the writ of Habeas Corpus (which had been
served at Passmore's office after he left) to the Anti-Slavery Office.
In his calm manner he handed it to the writer, at the same time
remarking that "Passmore had gone to Harrisburg," and added, "thee had
better attend to it" (the writ). Edward Hopper, Esq., was applied to
with the writ, and in the absence of Mr. Williamson, appeared before the
court, and stated "that the writ had not been served, as Mr. W. was out
of town," etc.

After this statement, the Judge postponed further action until the next
day. In the meanwhile, Mr. Williamson returned and found the writ
awaiting him, and an agitated state of feeling throughout the city
besides. Now it is very certain, that he did not seek to know from those
in the secret, where Jane Johnson and her boys were taken after they
left the wharf, or as to what disposition had been made of them, in any
way; except to ask simply, "are they safe?" (and when told "yes," he
smiled) consequently, he might have been examined for a week, by the
most skillful lawyer, at the Philadelphia bar, but he could not have
answered other than he did in making his return to the writ, before
Judge Kane, namely: "_That the persons named in the writ, nor either of
them, are now nor was at the time of issuing of the writ, or the
original writ, or at any other time in the custody, power, or possession
of the respondent, nor by him confined or restrained; wherefore he
cannot have the bodies," etc._.

Thus, while Mr. W. was subjected to the severest trial of his devotion
to Freedom, his noble bearing throughout, won for him the admiration and
sympathy of the friends of humanity and liberty throughout the entire
land, and in proof of his fidelity, he most cheerfully submitted to
imprisonment rather than desert his principles. But the truth was not
wanted in this instance by the enemies of Freedom; obedience to Slavery
was demanded to satisfy the South. The opportunity seemed favorable for
teaching abolitionists and negroes, that they had no right to interfere
with a "chivalrous southern gentleman," while passing through
Philadelphia with his slaves. Thus, to make an effective blow, all the
pro-slavery elements of Philadelphia were brought into action, and
matters looked for a time as though Slavery in this instance would have
everything its own way. Passmore was locked up in prison on the flimsy
pretext of contempt of court, and true bills were found against him and
half a dozen colored men, charging them with "riot," "forcible
abduction," and "assault and battery," and there was no lack of hard
swearing on the part of Col. Wheeler and his pro-slavery sympathizers in
substantiation of these grave charges. But the pro-slaveryites had
counted without their host--Passmore would not yield an inch, but stood
as firmly by his principles in prison, as he did on the boat. Indeed, it
was soon evident, that his resolute course was bringing floods of
sympathy from the ablest and best minds throughout the North. On the
other hand, the occasion was rapidly awakening thousands daily, who had
hitherto manifested little or no interest at all on the subject, to the
wrongs of the slave.

It was soon discovered by the "chivalry" that keeping Mr. Williamson in
prison would indirectly greatly aid the cause of Freedom--that every day
he remained would make numerous converts to the cause of liberty; that
Mr. Williamson was doing ten-fold more in prison for the cause of
universal liberty than he could possibly do while pursuing his ordinary
vocation.

With regard to the colored men under bonds, Col. Wheeler and his
satellites felt very confident that there was no room for them to
escape. They must have had reason so to think, judging from the hard
swearing they did, before the committing magistrate. Consequently, in
the order of events, while Passmore was still in prison, receiving
visits from hosts of friends, and letters of sympathy from all parts of
the North, William Still, William Curtis, James P. Braddock, John
Ballard, James Martin and Isaiah Moore, were brought into court for
trial. The first name on the list in the proceedings of the court was
called up first.

Against this individual, it was pretty well understood by the friends of
the slave, that no lack of pains and false swearing would be resorted to
on the part of Wheeler and his witnesses, to gain a verdict.

Mr. McKim and other noted abolitionists managing the defense, were
equally alive to the importance of overwhelming the enemy in this
particular issue. The Hon. Charles Gibbons, was engaged to defend
William Still, and William S. Pierce, Esq., and William B. Birney, Esq.,
the other five colored defendants.

In order to make the victory complete, the anti-slavery friends deemed
it of the highest importance to have Jane Johnson in court, to face her
master, and under oath to sweep away his "refuge of lies," with regard
to her being "abducted," and her unwillingness to "leave her master,"
etc. So Mr. McKim and the friends very privately arranged to have Jane
Johnson on hand at the opening of the defense.

Mrs. Lucretia Mott, Mrs. McKim, Miss Sarah Pugh and Mrs. Plumly,
volunteered to accompany this poor slave mother to the court-house and
to occupy seats by her side, while she should face her master, and
boldly, on oath, contradict all his hard swearing. A better subject for
the occasion than Jane, could not have been desired. She entered the
court room veiled, and of course was not known by the crowd, as pains
had been taken to keep the public in ignorance of the fact, that she was
to be brought on to bear witness. So that, at the conclusion of the
second witness on the part of the defense, "Jane Johnson" was called
for, in a shrill voice. Deliberately, Jane arose and answered, in a
lady-like manner to her name, and was then the observed of all
observers. Never before had such a scene been witnessed in Philadelphia.
It was indescribable. Substantially, her testimony on this occasion, was
in keeping with the subjoined affidavit, which was as follows--


    "_State of New York, City and County of New York_.

    "Jane Johnson being sworn, makes oath and says--

    "My name is Jane--Jane Johnson; I was the slave of Mr. Wheeler
    of Washington; he bought me and my two children, about two years
    ago, of Mr. Cornelius Crew, of Richmond, Va.; my youngest child
    is between six and seven years old, the other between ten and
    eleven; I have one other child only, and he is in Richmond; I
    have not seen him for about two years; never expect to see him
    again; Mr. Wheeler brought me and my two children to
    Philadelphia, on the way to Nicaragua, to wait on his wife; I
    didn't want to go without my two children, and he consented to
    take them; we came to Philadelphia by the cars; stopped at Mr.
    Sully's, Mr. Wheeler's father-in-law, a few moments; then went
    to the steamboat for New York at 2 o'clock, but were too late;
    we went into Bloodgood's Hotel; Mr. Wheeler went to dinner; Mr.
    Wheeler had told me in Washington to have nothing to say to
    colored persons, and if any of them spoke to me, to say I was a
    free woman traveling with a minister; we staid at Bloodgood's
    till 5 o'clock; Mr. Wheeler kept his eye on me all the time
    except when he was at dinner; he left his dinner to come and see
    if I was safe, and then went back again; while he was at dinner,
    I saw a colored woman and told her I was a slave woman, that my
    master had told me not to speak to colored people, and that if
    any of them spoke to me to say that I was free; but I am not
    free; but I want to be free; she said: 'poor thing, I pity you;'
    after that I saw a colored man and said the same thing to him,
    he said he would telegraph to New York, and two men would meet
    me at 9 o'clock and take me with them; after that we went on
    board the boat, Mr. Wheeler sat beside me on the deck; I saw a
    colored gentleman come on board, he beckoned to me; I nodded my
    head, and could not go; Mr. Wheeler was beside me and I was
    afraid; a white gentleman then came and said to Mr. Wheeler, 'I
    want to speak to your servant, and tell her of her rights;' Mr.
    Wheeler rose and said, 'If you have anything to say, say it to
    me--she knows her rights;' the white gentleman asked me if I
    wanted to be free; I said 'I do, but I belong to this gentleman
    and I can't have it;' he replied, 'Yes, you can, come with us,
    you are as free as your master, if you want your freedom come
    now; if you go back to Washington you may never get it;' I rose
    to go, Mr. Wheeler spoke, and said, 'I will give you your
    freedom,' but he had never promised it before, and I knew he
    would never give it to me; the white gentleman held out his hand
    and I went toward him; I was ready for the word before it was
    given me; I took the children by the hands, who both cried, for
    they were frightened, but both stopped when they got on shore; a
    colored man carried the little one, I led the other by the hand.
    We walked down the street till we got to a hack; nobody forced
    me away; nobody pulled me, and nobody led me; I went away of my
    own free will; I always wished to be free and meant to be free
    when I came North; I hardly expected it in Philadelphia, but I
    thought I should get free in New York; I have been comfortable
    and happy since I left Mr. Wheeler, and so are the children; I
    don't want to go back; I could have gone in Philadelphia if I
    had wanted to; I could go now; but I had rather die than go
    back. I wish to make this statement before a magistrate, because
    I understand that Mr. Williamson is in prison on my account, and
    I hope the truth may be of benefit to him."

It might have been supposed that her honest and straightforward
testimony would have been sufficient to cause even the most relentless
slaveholder to abandon at once a pursuit so monstrous and utterly
hopeless as Wheeler's was. But although he was sadly confused and put to
shame, he hung on to the "lost cause" tenaciously. And his counsel,
David Webster, Esq., and the United States District Attorney, Vandyke,
completely imbued with the pro-slavery spirit, were equally as
unyielding. And thus, with a zeal befitting the most worthy object
imaginable, they labored with untiring effort to convict the colored
men.

By this policy, however, the counsel for the defense was doubly aroused.
Mr. Gibbons, in the most eloquent and indignant strains, perfectly
annihilated the "distinguished Colonel John H. Wheeler, United States
Minister Plenipotentiary near the Island of Nicaragua," taking special
pains to ring the changes repeatedly on his long appellations. Mr.
Gibbons appeared to be precisely in the right mood to make himself
surpassingly forcible and eloquent, on whatever point of law he chose to
touch bearing on the case; or in whatever direction he chose to glance
at the injustice and cruelty of the South. Most vividly did he draw the
contrast between the States of "Georgia" and "Pennsylvania," with regard
to the atrocious laws of Georgia. Scarcely less vivid is the impression
after a lapse of sixteen years, than when this eloquent speech was made.
With the District Attorney, Wm. B. Mann, Esq., and his Honor, Judge
Kelley, the defendants had no cause to complain. Throughout the entire
proceedings, they had reason to feel, that neither of these officials
sympathized in the least with Wheeler or Slavery. Indeed in the Judge's
charge and also in the District Attorney's closing speech the ring of
freedom could be distinctly heard--much more so than was agreeable to
Wheeler and his Pro-Slavery sympathizers. The case of Wm. Still ended in
his acquittal; the other five colored men were taken up in order. And it
is scarcely necessary to say that Messrs. Peirce and Birney did full
justice to all concerned. Mr. Peirce, especially, was one of the oldest,
ablest and most faithful lawyers to the slave of the Philadelphia Bar.
He never was known, it may safely be said, to hesitate in the darkest
days of Slavery to give his time and talents to the fugitive, even in
the most hopeless cases, and when, from the unpopularity of such a
course, serious sacrifices would be likely to result. Consequently he
was but at home in this case, and most nobly did he defend his clients,
with the same earnestness that a man would defend his fireside against
the approach of burglars. At the conclusion of the trial, the jury
returned a verdict of "not guilty," as to all the persons in the first
count, charging them with riot. In the second count, charging them with
"Assault and Battery" (on Col. Wheeler) Ballard and Curtis were found
"guilty," the rest "not guilty." The guilty were given about a week in
jail. Thus ended this act in the Wheeler drama.

The following extract is taken from the correspondence of the New York
Tribune touching Jane Johnson's presence in the court, and will be
interesting on that account:


    "But it was a bold and perilous move on the part of her friends,
    and the deepest apprehensions were felt for a while, for the
    result. The United States Marshal was there with his warrant and
    an extra force to execute it. The officers of the court and
    other State officers were there to protect the witness and
    vindicate the laws of the State. Vandyke, the United States
    District Attorney, swore he would take her. The State officers
    swore he should not, and for a while it seemed that nothing
    could avert a bloody scene. It was expected that the conflict
    would take place at the door, when she should leave the room, so
    that when she and her friends went out, and for some time after,
    the most intense suspense pervaded the court-room. She was,
    however, allowed to enter the carriage that awaited her without
    disturbance. She was accompanied by Mr. McKim, Secretary of the
    Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society, Lucretia Mott and George
    Corson, one of our most manly and intrepid police officers. The
    carriage was followed by another filled with officers as a
    guard; and thus escorted she was taken back in safety to the
    house from which she had been brought. Her title to Freedom
    under the laws of the State will hardly again be brought into
    question."


Mr. Williamson was committed to prison by Judge Kane for contempt of
Court, on the 27th day of July, 1855, and was released on the 3d day of
November the same year, having gained, in the estimation of the friends
of Freedom every where, a triumph and a fame which but few men in the
great moral battle for Freedom could claim.

THE ARRIVALS OF A SINGLE MONTH.


SIXTY PASSENGERS CAME IN ONE MONTH--TWENTY-EIGHT IN ONE ARRIVAL--GREAT
PANIC AND INDIGNATION MEETING--INTERESTING CORRESPONDENCE FROM MASTERS
AND FUGITIVES.


The great number of cases to be here noticed forbids more than a brief
reference to each passenger. As they arrived in parties, their
narratives will be given in due order as found on the book of records:

William Griffen, Henry Moor, James Camper, Noah Ennells and Levin
Parker. This party came from Cambridge, Md.

William is thirty-four years of age, of medium size and substantial
appearance. He fled from James Waters, Esq., a lawyer, living in
Cambridge. He was "wealthy, close, and stingy," and owned nine head of
slaves and a farm, on which William served. He was used very hard, which
was the cause of his escape, though the idea that he was entitled to his
freedom had been entertained for the previous twelve years. On preparing
to take the Underground, he armed himself with a big butcher-knife, and
resolved, if attacked, to make his enemies stand back. His master was a
member of the Methodist Church.

Henry is tall, copper-colored, and about thirty years of age. He
complained not so much of bad usage as of the utter distaste he had to
working all the time for the "white people for nothing." He was also
decidedly of the opinion that every man should have his liberty. Four
years ago his wife was "sold away to Georgia" by her young master; since
which time not a word had he heard of her. She left three children, and
he, in escaping, also had to leave them in the same hands that sold
their mother. He was owned by Levin Dale, a farmer near Cambridge. Henry
was armed with a six-barreled revolver, a large knife, and a determined
mind.

James is twenty-four years of age, quite black, small size, keen look,
and full of hope for the "best part of Canada." He fled from Henry
Hooper, "a dashing young man and a member of the Episcopal Church." Left
because he "did not enjoy privileges" as he wished to do. He was armed
with two pistols and a dirk to defend himself.

Noah is only nineteen, quite dark, well-proportioned, and possessed of a
fair average of common sense. He was owned by "Black-head Bill LeCount,"
who "followed drinking, chewing tobacco, catching 'runaways,' and
hanging around the court-house." However, he owned six head of slaves,
and had a "rough wife," who belonged to the Methodist Church. Left
because he "expected every day to be sold"--his master being largely in
"debt." Brought with him a butcher-knife.

Levin is twenty-two, rather short built, medium size and well colored.
He fled from Lawrence G. Colson, "a very bad man, fond of drinking,
great to fight and swear, and hard to please." His mistress was "real
rough; very bad, worse than he was as 'fur' as she could be." Having
been stinted with food and clothing and worked hard, was the apology
offered by Levin for running off.

Stebney Swan, John Stinger, Robert Emerson, Anthony Pugh and Isabella
----. This company came from Portsmouth, Va. Stebney is thirty-four
years of age, medium size, mulatto, and quite wide awake. He was owned
by an oysterman by the name of Jos. Carter, who lived near Portsmouth.
Naturally enough his master "drank hard, gambled" extensively, and in
every other respect was a very ordinary man. Nevertheless, he "owned
twenty-five head," and had a wife and six children. Stebney testified
that he had not been used hard, though he had been on the "auction-block
three times." Left because he was "tired of being a servant." Armed with
a broad-axe and hatchet, he started, joined by the above-named
companions, and came in a skiff, by sea. Robert Lee was the brave
Captain engaged to pilot this Slavery-sick party from the prison-house
of bondage. And although every rod of rowing was attended with
inconceivable peril, the desired haven was safely reached, and the
overjoyed voyagers conducted to the Vigilance Committee.

John is about forty years of age, and so near white that a microscope
would be required to discern his colored origin. His father was white,
and his mother nearly so. He also had been owned by the oysterman
alluded to above; had been captain of one of his oyster-boats, until
recently. And but for his attempt some months back to make his escape,
he might have been this day in the care of his kind-hearted master. But,
because of this wayward step on the part of John, his master felt called
upon to humble him. Accordingly, the captaincy was taken from him, and
he was compelled to struggle on in a less honorable position.
Occasionally John's mind would be refreshed by his master relating the
hard times in the North, the great starvation among the blacks, etc. He
would also tell John how much better off he was as a "slave with a kind
master to provide for all his wants," etc. Notwithstanding all this
counsel, John did not rest contented until he was on the Underground
Rail Road.

Robert was only nineteen, with an intelligent face and prepossessing
manners; reads, writes and ciphers; and is about half Anglo-Saxon. He
fled from Wm. H. Wilson, Esq., Cashier of the Virginia Bank. Until
within the four years previous to Robert's escape, the cashier was
spoken of as a "very good man;" but in consequence of speculations in a
large Hotel in Portsmouth, and the then financial embarrassments, "he
had become seriously involved," and decidedly changed in his manners.
Robert noticed this, and concluded he had "better get out of danger as
soon as possible."

Anthony and Isabella were an engaged couple, and desired to cast their
lot where husband and wife could not be separated on the auction-block.

The following are of the Cambridge party, above alluded to. All left
together, but for prudential reasons separated before reaching
Philadelphia. The company that left Cambridge on the 24th of October may
be thus recognized: Aaron Cornish and wife, with their six children;
Solomon, George Anthony, Joseph, Edward James, Perry Lake, and a
nameless babe, all very likely; Kit Anthony and wife Leah, and three
children, Adam, Mary, and Murray; Joseph Hill and wife Alice, and their
son Henry; also Joseph's sister. Add to the above, Marshall Button and
George Light, both single young men, and we have twenty-eight in one
arrival, as hearty-looking, brave and interesting specimens of Slavery
as could well be produced from Maryland. Before setting out they counted
well the cost. Being aware that fifteen had left their neighborhood only
a few days ahead of them, and that every slave-holder and slave-catcher
throughout the community, were on the alert, and raging furiously
against the inroads of the Underground Rail Road, they provided
themselves with the following weapons of defense: three revolvers, three
double-barreled pistols, three single-barreled pistols, three
sword-canes, four butcher knives, one bowie-knife, and one paw.[A] Thus,
fully resolved upon freedom or death, with scarcely provisions enough
for a single day, while the rain and storm was piteously descending,
fathers and mothers with children in their arms (Aaron Cornish had
two)--the entire party started. Of course, their provisions gave out
before they were fairly on the way, but not so with the storm. It
continued to pour upon them for nearly three days. With nothing to
appease the gnawings of hunger but parched corn and a few dry crackers,
wet and cold, with several of the children sick, some of their feet bare
and worn, and one of the mothers with an infant in her arms, incapable
of partaking of the diet,--it is impossible to imagine the ordeal they
were passing. It was enough to cause the bravest hearts to falter. But
not for a moment did they allow themselves to look back. It was
exceedingly agreeable to hear even the little children testify that in
the most trying hour on the road, not for a moment did they want to go
back. The following advertisement, taken from _The Cambridge Democrat_
of November 4, shows how the Rev. Levi Traverse felt about Aaron--

[Footnote A: A paw is a weapon with iron prongs, four inches long, to be

    $300 Reward.--Ran away from the subscriber, from the
    neighborhood of Town Point, on Saturday night, the 24th inst.,
    my negro man, AARON CORNISH, about 35 years old. He is about
    five feet ten inches high, black, good-looking, rather pleasant
    countenance, and carries himself with a confident manner. He
    went off with his wife, DAFFNEY, a negro woman belonging to
    Reuben E. Phillips. I will give the above reward if taken out of
    the county, and $200 if taken in the county; in either case to
    be lodged in Cambridge Jail.

    Levi D. Traverse.


To fully understand the Rev. Mr. Traverse's authority for taking the
liberty he did with Aaron's good name, it may not be amiss to give
briefly a paragraph of private information from Aaron, relative to his
master. The Rev. Mr. Traverse belonged to the Methodist Church, and was
described by Aaron as a "bad young man; rattle-brained; with the
appearance of not having good sense,--not enough to manage the great
amount of property (he had been left wealthy) in his possession."
Aaron's servitude commenced under this spiritual protector in May prior
to the escape, immediately after the death of his old master. His
deceased master, William D. Traverse, by the way, was the father-in-law,
and at the same time own uncle of Aaron's reverend owner. Though the
young master, for marrying his own cousin and uncle's daughter, had been
for years the subject of the old gentleman's wrath, and was not allowed
to come near his house, or to entertain any reasonable hope of getting
any of his father-in-law's estate, nevertheless, scarcely had the old
man breathed his last, ere the young preacher seized upon the
inheritance, slaves and all; at least he claimed two-thirds, allowing
for the widow one-third. Unhesitatingly he had taken possession of all
the slaves (some thirty head), and was making them feel his power to the
fullest extent. To Aaron this increased oppression was exceedingly
crushing, as he had been hoping at the death of his old master to be
free. Indeed, it was understood that the old man had his will made, and
freedom provided for the slaves. But, strangely enough, at his death no
will could be found. Aaron was firmly of the conviction that the Rev.
Mr. Traverse knew what became of it. Between the widow and the
son-in-law, in consequence of his aggressive steps, existed much
hostility, which strongly indicated the approach of a law-suit;
therefore, except by escaping, Aaron could not see the faintest hope of
freedom. Under his old master, the favor of hiring his time had been
granted him. He had also been allowed by his wife's mistress (Miss Jane
Carter, of Baltimore), to have his wife and children home with him--that
is, until his children would grow to the age of eight and ten years,
then they would be taken away and hired out at twelve or fifteen dollars
a year at first. Her oldest boy, sixteen, hired the year he left for
forty dollars. They had had ten children; two had died, two they were
compelled to leave in chains; the rest they brought away. Not one
dollar's expense had they been to their mistress. The industrious Aaron
not only had to pay his own hire, but was obliged to do enough over-work
to support his large family.

Though he said he had no special complaint to make against his old
master, through whom he, with the rest of the slaves, hoped to obtain
freedom, Aaron, nevertheless, spoke of him as a man of violent temper,
severe on his slaves, drinking hard, etc., though he was a man of wealth
and stood high in the community. One of Aaron's brothers, and others,
had been sold South by him. It was on account of his inveterate hatred
of his son-in-law, who, he declared, should never have his property
(having no other heir but his niece, except his widow), that the slaves
relied on his promise to free them. Thus, in view of the facts referred
to, Aaron was led to commit the unpardonable sin of running away with
his wife Daffney, who, by the way, looked like a woman fully capable of
taking care of herself and children, instead of having them stolen away
from her, as though they were pigs.

Joseph Viney and family--Joseph was "held to service or labor," by
Charles Bryant, of Alexandria, Va. Joseph had very nearly finished
paying for himself. His wife and children were held by Samuel Pattison,
Esq., a member of the Methodist Church, "a great big man," "with red
eyes, bald head, drank pretty freely," and in the language of Joseph,
"wouldn't bear nothing." Two of Joseph's brothers-in-law had been sold
by his master. Against Mrs. Pattison his complaint was, that "she was
mean, sneaking, and did not want to give half enough to eat."

For the enlightenment of all Christendom, and coming posterity
especially, the following advertisement and letter are recorded, with
the hope that they will have an important historical value. The writer
was at great pains to obtain these interesting documents, directly after
the arrival of the memorable Twenty-Eight; and shortly afterwards
furnished to the New York _Tribune_, in a prudential manner, a brief
sketch of these very passengers, including the advertisements, but not
the letter. It was safely laid away for history--

    for his apprehension. _Leah_ is about 28 years old about five
    feet high dark chesnut coller, with three children. 2 Boys and 1
    girl, they are from one to eight years old, the oldest boy is
    called Adam, Leah is the wife of Kit, the first named man in the
    list. _Sarah Jane_ is about 25 years old, stout built and
    chesnut coller, quick and active in her walk. Making in all 15
    head, men, women and children belonging to me, or 16 head
    including Joe Viney, the husband of my woman Susan.

    _A Reward_ of $2250. will be given for my negroes if taken out
    of the State of Maryland and lodged in Cambridge or Baltimore
    Jail, so that I can get them or a fair proportion for any part
    of them. And including Joe Viney's reward $2650.00.

    At the same time eight other negroes belonging to a neighbor of
    mine ran off, for which a reward of $1400.00 has been offered
    for them.

    If you should want any information, witnesses to prove or
    indentify the negroes, write immediately on to me. Or if you
    should need any information with regard to proving the negroes,
    before I could reach Philadelphia, you can call on Mr. Burroughs
    at Martin & Smith's store, Market Street, No 308. Phila and he
    can refer you to a gentleman who knows the negroes.

    Yours &c SAML. PATTISON.


This letter was in answer to one written in Philadelphia and signed,
"L.W. Thompson." It is not improbable that Mr. Pattison's loss had
produced such a high state of mental excitement that he was hardly in a
condition for cool reflection, or he would have weighed the matter a
little more carefully before exposing himself to the U.G.R.R. agents.
But the letter possesses two commendable features, nevertheless. It was
tolerably well written and prompt.

Here is a wonderful exhibition of affection for his contented and happy
negroes. Whether Mr. Pattison suspended on suddenly learning that he was
minus fifteen head, the writer cannot say. But that there was a great
slave hunt in every direction there is no room to doubt. Though much
more might be said about the parties concerned, it must suffice to add
that they came to the Vigilance Committee in a very sad plight--in
tattered garments, hungry, sick, and penniless; but they were kindly
clothed, fed, doctored, and sent on their way rejoicing.

Daniel Stanly, Nat Amby, John Scott, Hannah Peters, Henrietta Dobson,
Elizabeth Amby, Josiah Stanly, Caroline Stanly, Daniel Stanly, jr., John
Stanly and Miller Stanly (arrival from Cambridge.) Daniel is about 35,
well-made and wide-awake. Fortunately, in emancipating himself, he also,
through great perseverance, secured the freedom of his wife and six
children; one child he was compelled to leave behind. Daniel belonged to
Robert Calender, a farmer, and, "except when in a passion," said to be
"pretty clever." However, considering as a father, that it was his "duty
to do all he could" for his children, and that all work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy, Daniel felt bound to seek refuge in Canada. His
wife and children were owned by "Samuel Count, an old, bald-headed, bad
man," who "had of late years been selling and buying slaves as a
business," though he stood high and was a "big bug in Cambridge." The
children were truly likely-looking.

Nat is no ordinary man. Like a certain other Nat known to history, his
honest and independent bearing in every respect was that of a natural
hero. He was full black, and about six feet high; of powerful physical
proportions, and of more than ordinary intellectual capacities. With the
strongest desire to make the Port of Canada safely, he had resolved to
be "carried back," if attacked by the slave hunters, "only as a dead
man." He was held to service by John Muir, a wealthy farmer, and the
owner of 40 or 50 slaves. "Muir would drink and was generally devilish."
Two of Nat's sisters and one of his brothers had been "sold away to
Georgia by him." Therefore, admonished by threats and fears of having to
pass through the same fiery furnace, Nat was led to consider the
U.G.R.R. scheme. It was through the marriage of Nat's mistress to his
present owner that he came into Muir's hands. "Up to the time of her
death," he had been encouraged to "hope" that he would be "free;"
indeed, he was assured by her "dying testimony that the slaves were not
to be sold." But regardless of the promises and will of his departed
wife, Muir soon extinguished all hopes of freedom from that quarter. But
not believing that God had put one man here to "be the servant of
another--to work," and get none of the benefit of his labor, Nat armed
himself with a good pistol and a big knife, and taking his wife with
him, bade adieu forever to bondage. Observing that Lizzie (Nat's wife)
looked pretty decided and resolute, a member of the committee remarked,
"Would your wife fight for freedom?" "I have heard her say she would
wade through blood and tears for her freedom," said Nat, in the most
serious mood.

The following advertisement from _The Cambridge Democrat_ of Nov. 4,
speaks for itself--


    $300 REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber, on Saturday night
    last, 17th inst., my negro woman Lizzie, about 28 years old. She
    is medium sized, dark complexion, good-looking, with rather a
    down look. When spoken to, replies quickly. She was well
    dressed, wearing a red and green blanket shawl, and carried with
    her a variety of clothing. She ran off in company with her
    husband, Nat Amby (belonging to John Muir, Esq.), who is about 6
    feet in height, with slight impediment in his speech, dark
    chestnut color, and a large scar on the side of his neck.

    [Illustration: ]

    I will give the above reward if taken in this County, or
    one-half of what she sells for if taken out of the County or
    State. In either ease to be lodged in Cambridge Jail.

    Cambridge, Oct. 21, 1857.

    ALEXANDER H. BAYLY.

    P.S.--For the apprehension of the above-named negro man Nat, and
    delivery in Cambridge Jail, I will give $500 reward.

    JOHN MUIR.


Now since Nat's master has been introduced in the above order, it seems
but appropriate that Nat should be heard too; consequently the following
letter is inserted for what it is worth:


    Auburn, June 10th, 1858.

    Mr. William Still:--Sir, will you be so Kind as to write a

William is 25, complexion brown, intellect naturally good, with no
favorable notions of the peculiar institution. He was armed with a
formidable dirk-knife, and declared he would use it if attacked, rather
than be dragged back to bondage.

Hannah is a hearty-looking young woman of 23 or 24, with a countenance
that indicated that liberty was what she wanted and was contending for,
and that she could not willingly submit to the yoke. Though she came
with the Cambridge party, she did not come from Cambridge, but from
Marshall Hope, Caroline County, where she had been owned by Charles
Peters, a man who had distinguished himself by getting "drunk,
scratching and fighting, etc.," not unfrequently in his own family even.
She had no parents that she knew of. Left because they used her "so bad,
beat and knocked" her about.

"Jack Scott." Jack is about thirty-six years of age, substantially
built, dark color, and of quiet and prepossessing manners. He was owned
by David B. Turner, Esq., a dry goods merchant of New York. By birth,
Turner was a Virginian, and a regular slave-holder. His slaves were kept
hired out by the year. As Jack had had but slight acquaintance with his
New York owner, he says but very little about him. He was moved to leave
simply because he had got tired of working for the "white people for
nothing." Fled from Richmond, Va. Jack went to Canada direct. The
following letter furnishes a clew to his whereabouts, plans, etc.


    MONTREAL, September 1st 1859.

    DEAR SIR:--It is with extreme pleasure that I set down to
    inclose you a few lines to let you know that I am well & I hope
    when these few lines come to hand they may find you & your
    family in good health and prosperity I left your house Nov. 3d,
    1857, for Canada I Received a letter here from James Carter in
    Peters burg, saying that my wife would leave there about the
    28th or the first September and that he would send her on by way
    of Philadelphia to you to send on to Montreal if she come on you
    be please to send her on and as there is so many boats coming
    here all times a day I may not know what time she will. So you
    be please to give her this direction, she can get a cab and go
    to the Donegana Hotel and Edmund Turner is there he will take
    you where I lives and if he is not there cabman take you to Mr
    Taylors on Durham St. nearly opposite to the Methodist Church.
    Nothing more at present but Remain your well wisher

    JOHN SCOTT.


C. Hitchens.--This individual took his departure from Milford, Del.,
where he was owned by Wm. Hill, a farmer, who took special delight in
having "fighting done on the place." This passenger was one of our least
intelligent travelers. He was about 22.

Major Ross.--Major fled from John Jay, a farmer residing in the
neighborhood of Havre de Grace, Md. But for the mean treatment received
from Mr. Jay, Major might have been foolish enough to have remained all
his days in chains. "It's an ill wind that blows nobody any good."

Henry Oberne.--Henry was to be free at 28, but preferred having it at
21, especially as he was not certain that 28 would ever come. He is of
chestnut color, well made, &c., and came from Seaford, Md.

Perry Burton.--Perry is about twenty-seven years of age, decidedly
colored, medium size, and only of ordinary intellect. He acknowledged
John R. Burton, a farmer on Indian River, as his master, and escaped
because he wanted "some day for himself."

Alfred Hubert, Israel Whitney and John Thompson. Alfred is of powerful
muscular appearance and naturally of a good intellect. He is full dark
chestnut color, and would doubtless fetch a high price. He was owned by
Mrs. Matilda Niles, from whom he had hired his time, paying $110 yearly.
He had no fault to find with his mistress, except he observed she had a
young family growing up, into whose hands he feared he might unluckily
fall some day, and saw no way of avoiding it but by flight. Being only
twenty-eight, he may yet make his mark.

Israel was owned by Elijah Money. All that he could say in favor of his
master was, that he treated him "respectfully," though he "drank hard."
Israel was about thirty-six, and another excellent specimen of an
able-bodied and wide-awake man. He hired his time at the rate of $120 a
year, and had to find his wife and child in the bargain. He came from
Alexandria, Va.



INTERESTING LETTER FROM ISRAEL.



    HAMILTON, Oct. 16, 1858.

    WILLIAM STILL--_My Dear Friend_:--I saw Carter and his friend a
    few days ago, and they told me, that you was well. On the
    seventh of October my wife came to Hamilton. Mr. A. Hurberd, who
    came from Virginia with me, is going to get married the 20th of
    November, next. I wish you would write to me how many of my
    friends you have seen since October, 1857. Montgomery Green
    keeps a barber shop in Cayuga, in the State of New York. I have
    not heard of Oscar Ball but once since I came here, and then he
    was well and doing well. George Carroll is in Hamilton. The
    times are very dull at present, and have been ever since I came
    here. Please write soon. Nothing more at present, only I still
    remain in Hamilton, C.W.

    ISRAEL WHITNEY.


John is nineteen years of age, mulatto, spare made, but not lacking in
courage, mother wit or perseverance. He was born in Fauquier county,
Va., and, after experiencing Slavery for a number of years there--being
sold two or three times to the "highest bidder"--he was finally
purchased by a cotton planter named Hezekiah Thompson, residing at
Huntsville, Alabama. Immediately after the sale Hezekiah bundled his new
"purchase" off to Alabama, where he succeeded in keeping him only about
two years, for at the end of that time John determined to strike a blow
for liberty. The incentive to this step was the inhuman treatment he was
subjected to. Cruel indeed did he find it there. His master was a young
man, "fond of drinking and carousing, and always ready for a fight or a
knock-down." A short time before John left his master whipped him so
severely with the "bull whip" that he could not use his arm for three or
four days. Seeing but one way of escape (and that more perilous than the
way William and Ellen Craft, or Henry Box Brown traveled), he resolved
to try it. It was to get on the top of the car, instead of inside of it,
and thus ride of nights, till nearly daylight, when, at a stopping-place
on the road, he would slip off the car, and conceal himself in the woods
until under cover of the next night he could manage to get on the top of
another car. By this most hazardous mode of travel he reached Virginia.

It may be best not to attempt to describe how he suffered at the hands
of his owners in Alabama; or how severely he was pinched with hunger in
traveling; or how, when he reached his old neighborhood in Virginia, he
could not venture to inquire for his mother, brothers or sisters, to
receive from them an affectionate word, an encouraging smile, a crust of
bread, or a drink of water.

Success attended his efforts for more than two weeks; but alas, after
having got back north of Richmond, on his way home to Alexandria, he was
captured and put in prison; his master being informed of the fact, came
on and took possession of him again. At first he refused to sell him;
said he "had money enough and owned about thirty slaves;" therefore
wished to "take him back to make an example of him." However, through
the persuasion of an uncle of his, he consented to sell. Accordingly,
John was put on the auction-block and bought for $1,300 by Green
McMurray, a regular trader in Richmond. McMurray again offered him for
sale, but in consequence of hard times and the high price demanded, John
did not go off, at least not in the way the trader desired to dispose of
him, but did, nevertheless, succeed in going off on the Underground Rail
Road. Thus once more he reached his old home, Alexandria. His mother was
in one place, and his six brothers and sisters evidently scattered,
where he knew not. Since he was five years of age, not one of them had
he seen.

If such sufferings and trials were not entitled to claim for the
sufferer the honor of a hero, where in all Christendom could one be
found who could prove a better title to that appellation?

It is needless to say that the Committee extended to him brotherly
kindness, sympathized with him deeply, and sent him on his way
rejoicing.

Of his subsequent career the following extract from a letter written at
London shows that he found no rest for the soles of his feet under the
Stars and Stripes in New York:


    I hope that you will remember John Thompson, who passed through
    your hands, I think, in October, 1857, at the same time that Mr.
    Cooper, from Charleston, South Carolina, came on. I was engaged
    at New York, in the barber business, with a friend, and was
    doing very well, when I was betrayed and obliged to sail for
    England very suddenly, my master being in the city to arrest me.

    (LONDON, December 21st, 1860.)


[Illustration: Escaping from Alabama on top of a car.]

JEREMIAH COLBURN.--Jeremiah is a bright mulatto, of prepossessing
appearance, reads and writes, and is quite intelligent. He fled from
Charleston, where he had been owned by Mrs. E. Williamson, an old lady
about seventy-five, a member of the Episcopal Church, and opposed to
Freedom. As far as he was concerned, however, he said, she had treated
him well; but, knowing that the old lady would not be long here, he
judged it was best to look out in time. Consequently, he availed himself
of an Underground Rail Road ticket, and bade adieu to that hot-bed of
secession, South Carolina. Indeed, he was fair enough to pass for white,
and actually came the entire journey from Charleston to this city under
the garb of a white gentleman. With regard to gentlemanly bearing,
however, he was all right in this particular. Nevertheless, as he had
been a slave all his days, he found that it required no small amount of
nerve to succeed in running the gauntlet with slave-holders and
slave-catchers for so long a journey.

The following pointed epistle, from Jeremiah Colburn alias William
Cooper, beautifully illustrates the effects of Freedom on many a
passenger who received hospitalities at the Philadelphia depot--


    SYRACUSE, June 9th, 1858.

    MR. STILL:--_Dear Sir_:--One of your Underground R.R. Passenger
    Drop you these few Lines to let you see that he have not
    forgoten you one who have Done so much for him well sir I am
    still in Syracuse, well in regard to what I am Doing for a
    Living I no you would like to hear, I am in the Painting
    Business, and have as much at that as I can do, and enough to
    Last me all the Summer, I had a knolledge of Painting Before I
    Left the South, the Hotell where I was working Last winter the
    Proprietor fail & shot up in the Spring and I Loose evry thing
    that I was working for all Last winter. I have Ritten a Letter
    to my Friend P. Christianson some time a goo & have never
    Received an Answer, I hope this wont Be the case with this one,
    I have an idea sir, next winter iff I can this summer make
    Enough to Pay Expenses, to goo to that school at McGrowville &
    spend my winter their. I am going sir to try to Prepair myself
    for a Lectuer, I am going sir By the Help of god to try and Do
    something for the Caus to help my Poor Breathern that are
    suffering under the yoke. Do give my Respect to Mrs Stills &
    Perticular to Miss Julia Kelly, I supose she is still with you
    yet, I am in great hast you must excuse my short letter. I hope
    these few Lines may fine you as they Leave me quite well. It
    will afford me much Pleasure to hear from you.

    yours Truly,

    WILLIAM COOPER.

    John Thompson is still here and Doing well.


It will be seen that this young Charlestonian had rather exalted notions
in his head. He was contemplating going to McGrawville College, for the
purpose of preparing himself for the lecturing field. Was it not rather
strange that he did not want to return to his "kind-hearted old
mistress?"

THOMAS HENRY, NATHAN COLLINS AND HIS WIFE MARY ELLEN.--Thomas is about
twenty-six, quite dark, rather of a raw-boned make, indicating that
times with him had been other than smooth. A certain Josiah Wilson owned
Thomas. He was a cross, rugged man, allowing not half enough to eat, and
worked his slaves late and early. Especially within the last two or
three months previous to the escape, he had been intensely savage, in
consequence of having lost, not long before, two of his servants. Ever
since that misfortune, he had frequently talked of "putting the rest in
his pocket." This distressing threat made the rest love him none the
more; but, to make assurances doubly sure, after giving them their
supper every evening, which consisted of delicious "skimmed milk, corn
cake and a herring each," he would very carefully send them up in the
loft over the kitchen, and there "lock them up," to remain until called
the next morning at three or four o'clock to go to work again. Destitute
of money, clothing, and a knowledge of the way, situated as they were
they concluded to make an effort for Canada.

NATHAN was also a fellow-servant with Thomas, and of course owned by
Wilson. Nathan's wife, however, was owned by Wilson's son, Abram. Nathan
was about twenty-five years of age, not very dark. He had a remarkably
large head on his shoulders and was the picture of determination, and
apparently was exactly the kind of a subject that might be desirable in
the British possessions, in the forest or on the farm.

His wife, Mary Ellen, is a brown-skinned, country-looking young woman,
about twenty years of age. In escaping, they had to break jail, in the
dead of night, while all were asleep in the big house; and thus they
succeeded. What Mr. Wilson did, said or thought about these "shiftless"
creatures we are not prepared to say; we may, notwithstanding,
reasonably infer that the Underground has come in for a liberal share of
his indignation and wrath. The above travelers came from near New
Market, Md. The few rags they were clad in were not really worth the
price that a woman would ask for washing them, yet they brought with
them about all they had. Thus they had to be newly rigged at the expense
of the Vigilance Committee.

_The Cambridge Democrat_, of Nov. 4, 1857, from which the advertisements
were cut, said--


    "At a meeting of the people of this county, held in Cambridge,
    on the 2d of November, to take into consideration the better
    protection of the interests of the slave-owners; among other
    things that were done, it was resolved to enforce the various
    acts of Assembly  *  *  *  *  relating to servants and slaves.

    "The act of 1715, chap. 44, sec. 2, provides 'that from and
    after the publication thereof no servant or servants whatsoever,
    within this province, whether by indenture or by the custom of
    the counties, or hired for wages shall travel by land or water
    ten miles from the house of his, her or their master, mistress
    or dame, without a note under their hands, or under the hands of
    his, her or their overseer, if any be, under the penalty of
    being taken for a runaway, and to suffer such penalties as
    hereafter provided against runaways.' The Act of 1806, chap. 81,
    sec. 5, provides, 'That any person taking up such runaway, shall
    have and receive $6,' to be paid by the master or owner. It was
    also determined to have put in force the act of 1825, chap. 161,
    and the act of 1839, chap. 320, relative to idle, vagabond, free
    negroes, providing for their sale or banishment from the State.
    All persons interested, are hereby notified that the aforesaid
    laws, in particular, will be enforced, and all officers failing
    to enforce them will be presented to the Grand Jury, and those
    who desire to avoid the penalties of the aforesaid statutes are
    requested to conform to these provisions."


As to the modus operandi by which so many men, women and children were
delivered and safely forwarded to Canada, despite slave-hunters and the
fugitive slave law, the subjoined letters, from different agents and
depots, will throw important light on the question.

Men and women aided in this cause who were influenced by no oath of
secresy, who received not a farthing for their labors, who believed that
God had put it into the hearts of all mankind to love liberty, and had
commanded men to "feel for those in bonds as bound with them," "to break
every yoke and let the oppressed go free." But here are the letters,
bearing at least on some of the travelers:


    WILMINGTON, 10th Mo. 31st, 1857.

    ESTEEMED FRIEND WILLIAM STILL:--I write to inform thee that we
    have either 17 or 27, I am not certain which, of that large Gang
    of God's poor, and I hope they are safe. The man who has them in
    charge informed me there were 27 safe and one boy lost during
    last night, about 14 years of age, without shoes; we have felt
    some anxiety about him, for fear he may be taken up and betray
    the rest. I have since been informed there are but 17 so that I
    cannot at present tell which is correct. I have several looking
    out for the lad; they will be kept from Phila. for the present.
    My principal object in writing thee at this time is to inform
    thee of what one of our constables told me this morning; he told
    me that a colored man in Phila. who professed to be a great
    friend of the colored people was a traitor; that he had been
    written to by an Abolitionist in Baltimore, to keep a look out
    for those slaves that left Cambridge this night week, told him
    they would be likely to pass through Wilmington on 6th day or
    7th day night, and the colored man in Phila. had written to the
    master of part of them telling him the above, and the master
    arrived here yesterday in consequence of the information, and
    told one of our constables the above; the man told the name of
    the Baltimore writer, which he had forgotten, but declined
    telling the name of the colored man in Phila. I hope you will be
    able to find out who he is, and should I be able to learn the
    name of the Baltimore friend, I will put him on his Guard,
    respecting his Phila. correspondents. As ever thy friend, and
    the friend of Humanity, without regard to color or clime.

    THOS. GARRETT.


How much truth there was in the "constable's" story to the effect, "that
a colored man in Philadelphia, who professed to be a great friend of the
colored people, was a traitor, etc.," the Committee never learned. As a
general thing, colored people were true to the fugitive slave; but now
and then some unprincipled individuals, under various pretenses, would
cause us great anxiety.

    NORRISTOWN Oct 18th 1857 2 o'clock PM

    DEAR SIR:--There is Six men and women and Five children making
    Eleven Persons. If you are willing to Receve them write to me
    imediately and I will bring them to your To morrow Evening I
    would not Have wrote this But the Times are so much worse
    Financialy that I thought It best to hear From you Before I
    Brought such a Crowd Down Pleas Answer this and

    Oblige

    JOHN AUGUSTA.


This document has somewhat of a military appearance about it. It is
short and to the point. Friend Augusta was well known in Norristown as a
first-rate hair-dresser and a prompt and trustworthy Underground Rail
Road agent. Of course a speedy answer was returned to his note, and he
was instructed to bring the eleven passengers on to the Committee in
Brotherly Love.



LETTER FROM MISS G. LEWIS ABOUT A PORTION OF THE SAME "MEMORABLE
TWENTY-EIGHT."



    SUNNYSIDE, Nov. 6th, 1857.

    DEAR FRIEND:--Eight more of the large company reached our place
    last night, direct from Ercildown. The eight constitute one
    family of them, the husband and wife with four children under
    eight years of age, wish tickets for Elmira. Three sons, nearly
    grown, will be forwarded to Phila., probably by the train which
    passes Phoenixville at seven o'clock of to-morrow evening the
    seventh. It would be safest to meet them there. We shall send
    them to Elijah with the request for them to be sent there. And I
    presume they will be. If they should not arrive you may suppose
    it did not suit Elijah to send them.

    We will send the money for the tickets by C.C. Burleigh, who
    will be in Phila. on second day morning. If you please, you will
    forward the tickets by to-morrow's mail as we do not have a mail
    again till third day.

    Yours hastily,

    Q. LEWIS.

    Please give directions for forwarding to Elmira and name the
    price of tickets.


At first Miss Lewis thought of forwarding only a part of her fugitive
guests to the Committee in Philadelphia, but on further consideration,
all were safely sent along in due time, and the Committee took great
pains to have them made as comfortable as possible, as the cases of
these mothers and children especially called forth the deepest sympathy.

In this connection it seems but fitting to allude to Captain Lee's
sufferings on account of his having brought away in a skiff, by sea, a
party of four, alluded to in the beginning of this single month's
report.

Unfortunately he was suspected, arrested, tried, convicted, and torn
from his wife and two little children, and sent to the Richmond
Penitentiary for twenty-five years. Before being sent away from
Portsmouth, Va., where he was tried, for ten days in succession in the
prison five lashes a day were laid heavily on his bare back. The further
sufferings of poor Lee and his heart-broken wife, and his little
daughter and son, are too painful for minute recital. In this city the
friends of Freedom did all in their power to comfort Mrs. Lee, and
administered aid to her and her children; but she broke down under her
mournful fate, and went to that bourne from whence no traveler ever
returns.

Captain Lee suffered untold misery in prison, until he, also, not a
great while before the Union forces took possession of Richmond, sank
beneath the severity of his treatment, and went likewise to the grave.
The two children for a long time were under the care of Mr. Wm. Ingram
of Philadelphia, who voluntarily, from pure benevolence, proved himself
to be a father and a friend to them. To their poor mother also he had
been a true friend.

The way in which Captain Lee came to be convicted, if the Committee were
correctly informed and they think they were, was substantially in this
wise: In the darkness of the night, four men, two of them constables,
one of the other two, the owner of one of the slaves who had been aided
away by Lee, seized the wife of one of the fugitives and took her to the
woods, where the fiends stripped every particle of clothing from her
person, tied her to a tree, and armed with knives, cowhides and a
shovel, swore vengeance against her, declaring they would kill her if
she did not testify against Lee. At first she refused to reveal the
secret; indeed she knew but little to reveal; but her savage tormentors
beat her almost to death. Under this barbarous infliction she was
constrained to implicate Captain Lee, which was about all the evidence
the prosecution had against him. And in reality her evidence, for two
reasons, should not have weighed a straw, as it was contrary to the laws
of the State of Virginia, to admit the testimony of colored persons
against white; then again for the reason that this testimony was
obtained wholly by brute force.

But in this instance, this woman on whom the murderous attack had been
made, was brought into court on Lee's trial and was bid to simply make
her statement with regard to Lee's connection with the escape of her
husband. This she did of course. And in the eyes of this chivalric
court, this procedure "was all right." But thank God the events since
those dark and dreadful days, afford abundant proof that the All-seeing
Eye was not asleep to the daily sufferings of the poor bondman.

A SLAVE GIRL'S NARRATIVE.


CORDELIA LONEY, SLAVE OF MRS. JOSEPH CAHELL (WIDOW OF THE LATE HON.
JOSEPH CAHELL, OF VA.), OF FREDERICKSBURG, VA.--CORDELIA'S ESCAPE FROM
HER MISTRESS IN PHILADELPHIA.


Rarely did the peculiar institution present the relations of mistress
and maid-servant in a light so apparently favorable as in the case of
Mrs. Joseph Cahell (widow of the late Hon. Jos Cahell, of Va.), and her
slave, Cordelia. The Vigilance Committee's first knowledge of either of
these memorable personages was brought about in the following manner.

About the 30th of March, in the year 1859, a member of the Vigilance
Committee was notified by a colored servant, living at a fashionable
boarding-house on Chestnut street that a lady with a slave woman from
Fredericksburg, Va., was boarding at said house, and, that said slave
woman desired to receive counsel and aid from the Committee, as she was
anxious to secure her freedom, before her mistress returned to the
South. On further consultation about the matter, a suitable hour was
named for the meeting of the Committee and the Slave at the above named
boarding-house. Finding that the woman was thoroughly reliable, the
Committee told her "that two modes of deliverance were open before her.
One was to take her trunk and all her clothing and quietly retire." The
other was to "sue out a writ of habeas corpus; and bring the mistress
before the Court, where she would be required, under the laws of
Pennsylvania, to show cause why she restrained this woman of her
freedom." Cordelia concluded to adopt the former expedient, provided the
Committee would protect her. Without hesitation the Committee answered
her, that to the extent of their ability, she should have their aid with
pleasure, without delay. Consequently a member of the Committee was
directed to be on hand at a given hour that evening, as Cordelia would
certainly be ready to leave her mistress to take care of herself. Thus,
at the appointed hour, Cordelia, very deliberately, accompanied the
Committee away from her "kind hearted old mistress."

In the quiet and security of the Vigilance Committee Room, Cordelia
related substantially the following brief story touching her
relationship as a slave to Mrs. Joseph Cahell. In this case, as with
thousands and tens of thousands of others, as the old adage fitly
expresses it, "All is not gold that glitters." Under this apparently
pious and noble-minded lady, it will be seen, that Cordelia had known
naught but misery and sorrow.

Mrs. Cahell, having engaged board for a month at a fashionable private
boarding-house on Chestnut street, took an early opportunity to caution
Cordelia against going into the streets, and against having anything to
say or do with "free niggers in particular"; withal, she appeared
unusually kind, so much so, that before retiring to bed in the evening,
she would call Cordelia to her chamber, and by her side would take her
Prayer-book and Bible, and go through the forms of devotional service.
She stood very high both as a church communicant and a lady in society.

For a fortnight it seemed as though her prayers were to be answered, for
Cordelia apparently bore herself as submissively as ever, and Madame
received calls and accepted invitations from some of the _elite_ of the
city, without suspecting any intention on the part of Cordelia to
escape. But Cordelia could not forget how her children had all been sold
by her mistress!

Cordelia was about fifty-seven years of age, with about an equal
proportion of colored and white blood in her veins; very neat,
respectful and prepossessing in manner.

From her birth to the hour of her escape she had worn the yoke under
Mrs. C., as her most efficient and reliable maid-servant. She had been
at her mistress' beck and call as seamstress, dressing-maid, nurse in
the sickroom, etc., etc., under circumstances that might appear to the
casual observer uncommonly favorable for a slave. Indeed, on his first
interview with her, the Committee man was so forcibly impressed with the
belief, that her condition in Virginia had been favorable, that he
hesitated to ask her if she did not desire her liberty. A few moments'
conversation with her, however, convinced him of her good sense and
decision of purpose with regard to this matter. For, in answer to the
first question he put to her, she answered, that, "As many creature
comforts and religious privileges as she had been the recipient of under
her 'kind mistress,' still she 'wanted to be free,' and 'was bound to
leave,' that she had been 'treated very cruelly,' that her children had
'all been sold away' from her; that she had been threatened with sale
herself 'on the first insult,'" etc.

She was willing to take the entire responsibility of taking care of
herself. On the suggestion of a friend, before leaving her mistress, she
was disposed to sue for her freedom, but, upon a reconsideration of the
matter, she chose rather to accept the hospitality of the Underground
Rail Road, and leave in a quiet way and go to Canada, where she would be
free indeed. Accordingly she left her mistress and was soon a free
woman.

The following sad experience she related calmly, in the presence of
several friends, an evening or two after she left her mistress:

Two sons and two daughters had been sold from her by her mistress,
within the last three years, since the death of her master. Three of her
children had been sold to the Richmond market and the other in Nelson
county.

Paulina was the first sold, two years ago last May. Nat was the next; he
was sold to Abram Warrick, of Richmond. Paulina was sold before it was
named to her mother that it had entered her mistress's mind to dispose
of her. Nancy, from infancy, had been in poor health. Nevertheless, she
had been obliged to take her place in the field with the rest of the
slaves, of more rugged constitution, until she had passed her twentieth
year, and had become a mother. Under these circumstances, the overseer
and his wife complained to the mistress that her health was really too
bad for a field hand and begged that she might be taken where her duties
would be less oppressive. Accordingly, she was withdrawn from the field,
and was set to spinning and weaving. When too sick to work her mistress
invariably took the ground, that "nothing was the matter,"
notwithstanding the fact, that her family physician, Dr. Ellsom, had
pronounced her "quite weakly and sick."

In an angry mood one day, Mrs. Cahell declared she would cure her; and
again sent her to the field, "with orders to the overseer, to whip her
every day, and make her work or kill her." Again the overseer said it
was "no use to try, for her health would not stand it," and she was
forthwith returned. The mistress then concluded to sell her.

One Sabbath evening a nephew of hers, who resided in New Orleans,
happened to be on a visit to his aunt, when it occurred to her, that she
had "better get Nancy off if possible." Accordingly, Nancy was called in
for examination. Being dressed in her "Sunday best" and "before a poor
candle-light," she appeared to good advantage; and the nephew concluded
to start with her on the following Tuesday morning. However, the next
morning, he happened to see her by the light of the sun, and in her
working garments, which satisfied him that he had been grossly deceived;
that she would barely live to reach New Orleans; he positively refused
to carry out the previous evening's contract, thus leaving her in the
hands of her mistress, with the advice, that she should "doctor her up."

The mistress, not disposed to be defeated, obviated the difficulty by
selecting a little boy, made a lot of the two, and thus made it an
inducement to a purchaser to buy the sick woman; the boy and the woman
brought $700.

In the sale of her children, Cordelia was as little regarded as if she
had been a cow.

"I felt wretched," she said, with emphasis, "when I heard that Nancy had
been sold," which was not until after she had been removed. "But," she
continued, "I was not at liberty to make my grief known to a single
white soul. I wept and couldn't help it." But remembering that she was
liable, "on the first insult," to be sold herself, she sought no
sympathy from her mistress, whom she describes as "a woman who shows as
little kindness towards her servants as any woman in the States of
America. She neither likes to feed nor clothe well."

With regard to flogging, however, in days past, she had been up to the
mark. "A many a slap and blow" had Cordelia received since she arrived
at womanhood, directly from the madam's own hand.

One day smarting under cruel treatment, she appealed to her mistress in
the following strain: "I stood by your mother in all her sickness and
nursed her till she died!" "I waited on your niece, night and day for
months, till she died." "I waited upon your husband all my life--in his
sickness especially, and shrouded him in death, etc., yet I am treated
cruelly." It was of no avail.

Her mistress, at one time, was the owner of about five hundred slaves,
but within the last few years she had greatly lessened the number by
sales.

She stood very high as a lady, and was a member of the Episcopal Church.

To punish Cordelia, on several occasions, she had been sent to one of
the plantations to work as a field hand. Fortunately, however, she found
the overseers more compassionate than her mistress, though she received
no particular favors from any of them.

Asking her to name the overseers, etc., she did so. The first was
"Marks, a thin-visaged, poor-looking man, great for swearing." The
second was "Gilbert Brower, a very rash, portly man." The third was
"Buck Young, a stout man, and very sharp." The fourth was "Lynn Powell,
a tall man with red whiskers, very contrary and spiteful." There was
also a fifth one, but his name was lost.

Thus Cordelia's experience, though chiefly confined to the "great
house," extended occasionally over the corn and tobacco fields, among
the overseers and field hands generally. But under no circumstances
could she find it in her heart to be thankful for the privileges of
Slavery.

After leaving her mistress she learned, with no little degree of
pleasure, that a perplexed state of things existed at the
boarding-house; that her mistress was seriously puzzled to imagine how
she would get her shoes and stockings on and off; how she would get her
head combed, get dressed, be attended to in sickness, etc., as she
(Cordelia), had been compelled to discharge these offices all her life.

Most of the boarders, being slave-holders, naturally sympathized in her
affliction; and some of them went so far as to offer a reward to some of
the colored servants to gain a knowledge of her whereabouts. Some
charged the servants with having a hand in her leaving, but all agreed
that "she had left a very kind and indulgent mistress," and had acted
very foolishly in running out of Slavery into Freedom.

A certain Doctor of Divinity, the pastor of an Episcopal church in this
city and a friend of the mistress, hearing of her distress, by request
or voluntarily, undertook to find out Cordelia's place of seclusion.
Hailing on the street a certain colored man with a familiar face, who he
thought knew nearly all the colored people about town, he related to him
the predicament of his lady friend from the South, remarked how kindly
she had always treated her servants, signified that Cordelia would rue
the change, and be left to suffer among the "miserable blacks down
town," that she would not be able to take care of herself; quoted
Scripture justifying Slavery, and finally suggested that he (the colored
man) would be doing a duty and a kindness to the fugitive by using his
influence to "find her and prevail upon her to return."

It so happened that the colored man thus addressed, was Thomas Dorsey,
the well-known fashionable caterer of Philadelphia, who had had the
experience of quite a number of years as a slave at the South,--had
himself once been pursued as a fugitive, and having, by his industry in
the condition of Freedom, acquired a handsome estate, he felt entirely
qualified to reply to the reverend gentleman, which he did, though in
not very respectful phrases, telling him that Cordelia had as good a
right to her liberty as he had, or her mistress either; that God had
never intended one man to be the slave of another; that it was all false
about the slaves being better off than the free colored people; that he
would find as many "poor, miserably degraded," of his own color
"down-town," as among the "degraded blacks"; and concluded by telling
him that he would "rather give her a hundred dollars to help her off,
than to do aught to make known her whereabouts, if he knew ever so much
about her."

What further steps were taken by the discomfited divine, the mistress,
or her boarding-house sympathizers, the Committee was not informed.

But with regard to Cordelia: she took her departure for Canada, in the
midst of the Daniel Webster (fugitive) trial, with the hope of being
permitted to enjoy the remainder of her life in Freedom and peace. Being
a member of the Baptist Church, and professing to be a Christian, she
was persuaded that, by industry and assistance of the Lord, a way would
be opened to the seeker of Freedom even in a strange land and among
strangers.

This story appeared in part in the _N.Y. Evening Post_, having been
furnished by the writer, without his name to it. It is certainly none
the less interesting now, as it may be read in the light of Universal
Emancipation.

ARRIVAL OF JACKSON, ISAAC AND EDMONDSON TURNER FROM PETERSBURG.


TOUCHING SCENE ON MEETING THEIR OLD BLIND FATHER AT THE U.G.R.R. DEPOT.


LETTERS AND WARNING TO SLAVEHOLDERS.

About the latter part of December, 1857, Isaac and Edmondson, brothers,
succeeded in making their escape together from Petersburg, Va. They
barely escaped the auction block, as their mistress, Mrs. Ann Colley, a
widow, had just completed arrangements for their sale on the coming
first day of January. In this kind of property, however, Mrs. Colley had
not largely invested. In the days of her prosperity, while all was happy
and contented, she could only boast of "four head:" these brothers,
Jackson, Isaac and Edmondson and one other. In May, 1857, Jackson had
fled and was received by the Vigilance Committee, who placed him upon
their books briefly in the following light:


    "RUNAWAY--_Fifty Dollars Reward_,--Ran away some time in May
    last, my _Servant-man_, who calls himself _Jackson Turner_. He
    is about 27 years of age, and has one of his front teeth out. He
    is quite black, with thick lips, a little bow-legged, and looks
    down when spoken to. I will give a reward of Fifty dollars if
    taken out of the city, and twenty five Dollars if taken within
    the city. I forewarn all masters of vessels from harboring or
    employing the said slave; all persons who disregard this Notice
    will be punished as the law directs.

    ANN COLLEY.

    Petersburg, June 8th, 1857."


JACKSON is quite dark, medium size, and well informed for one in his
condition. In Slavery, he had been "pressed hard." His hire, "ten
dollars per month" he was obliged to produce at the end of each month,
no matter how much he had been called upon to expend for "doctor bills,
&c." The woman he called mistress went by the name of Ann Colley, a
widow, living near Petersburg. "She was very quarrelsome," although a
"member of the Methodist Church." Jackson seeing that his mistress was
yearly growing "harder and harder," concluded to try and better his
condition "if possible." Having a free wife in the North, who was in the
habit of communicating with him, he was kept fully awake to the love of
Freedom. The Underground Rail Road expense the Committee gladly bore. No
further record of Jackson was made. Jackson found his poor old father
here, where he had resided for a number of years in a state of almost
total blindness, and of course in much parental anxiety about his boys
in chains. On the arrival of Jackson, his heart overflowed with joy and
gratitude not easily described, as the old man had hardly been able to
muster faith enough to believe that he should ever look with his dim
eyes upon one of his sons in Freedom. After a day or two's tarrying,
Jackson took his departure for safer and more healthful localities,--her
"British Majesty's possessions." The old man remained only to feel more
keenly than ever, the pang of having sons still toiling in hopeless
servitude.

In less than seven months after Jackson had shaken off the yoke, to the
unspeakable joy of the father, Isaac and Edmondson succeeded in
following their brother's example, and were made happy partakers of the
benefits and blessings of the Vigilance Committee of Philadelphia. On
first meeting his two boys, at the Underground Rail Road Depot, the old
man took each one in his arms, and as looking through a glass darkly,
straining every nerve of his almost lost sight, exclaiming, whilst
hugging them closer and closer to his bosom for some minutes, in tears
of joy and wonder, "My son Isaac, is this you? my son Isaac, is this
you, &c.?" The scene was calculated to awaken the deepest emotion and to
bring tears to eyes not accustomed to weep. Little had the old man
dreamed in his days of sadness, that he should share such a feast of joy
over the deliverance of his sons. But it is in vain to attempt to
picture the affecting scene at this reunion, for that would be
impossible. Of their slave life, the records contain but a short notice,
simply as follows:

"Isaac is twenty-eight years of age, hearty-looking, well made, dark
color and intelligent. He was owned by Mrs. Ann Colley, a widow,
residing near Petersburg, Va. Isaac and Edmondson were to have been
sold, on New Year's day; a few days hence. How sad her disappointment
must have been on finding them gone, may be more easily imagined than
described."

Edmondson is about twenty-five, a brother of Isaac, and a smart,
good-looking young man, was owned by Mrs. Colley also. "This is just the
class of fugitives to make good subjects for John Bull," thought the
Committee, feeling pretty well assured that they would make good reports
after having enjoyed free air in Canada for a short time. Of course, the
Committee enjoined upon them very earnestly "not to forget their
brethren left behind groaning in fetters; but to prove by their
industry, uprightness, economy, sobriety and thrift, by the remembrance
of their former days of oppression and their obligations to their God,
that they were worthy of the country to which they were going, and so to
help break the bands of the oppressors, and undo the heavy burdens of
the oppressed." Similar advice was impressed upon the minds of all
travelers passing over this branch of the Underground Rail Road. From
hundreds thus admonished, letters came affording the most gratifying
evidence that the counsel of the Committee was not in vain. The appended
letter from the youngest brother, written with his own hand, will
indicate his feelings and views in Canada:

The same writer sent to the Corresponding Secretary the following
"Warning to Slave-holders." At the time these documents were received,
Slaveholders were never more defiant. The right to trample on the weak
in oppression was indisputable. "Cinnamon and odors, and ointments, and
frankincense, and wine, and oil, and fine flour and wheat, and beasts,
and sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men,"
slave-holders believed doubtless were theirs by Divine Right. Little
dreaming that in less than three short years--"Therefore shall her
plagues come in one day, death, and mourning, and famine." In view of
the marvelous changes which have been wrought by the hand of the
Almighty, this warning to slave-holders from one who felt the sting of
Slavery, as evincing a particular phase of simple faith and Christian
charity is entitled to a place in these records.



A WARNING TO SLAVE-HOLDERS.



    Well may the Southern slaveholder say, that holding their Fellow
    men in Bondage is no sin, because it is their delight as the
    Egyptians, so do they; but nevertheless God in his own good time
    will bring them out by a mighty hand, as it is recorded in the
    sacred oracles of truth, that Ethiopia shall soon stretch out
    her hands to God, speaking in the positive (shall). And my
    prayer is to you, oh, slaveholder, in the name of that God who
    in the beginning said, Let there be light, and there was light.
    Let my People go that they may serve me; thereby good may come
    unto thee and to thy children's children. Slave-holder have you
    seriously thought upon the condition yourselves, family and
    slaves; have you read where Christ has enjoined upon all his
    creatures to read his word, thereby that they may have no excuse
    when coming before his judgment seat? But you say he shall not
    read his word, consequently his sin will be upon your head. I
    think every man has as much as he can do to answer for his own
    sins. And now my dear-slave-holder, who with you are bound and
    fast hastening to judgment? As one that loves your soul repent
    ye, therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted
    out when the time of refreshing shall come from the presence of
    the Lord.

    In the language of the poet:

      Stop, poor sinner, stop and think,
        Before you further go;
      Think upon the brink of death
        Of everlasting woe.
      Say, have you an arm like God,
        That you his will oppose?
      Fear you not that iron rod
        With which he breaks his foes?


    Is the prayer of one that loves your souls.

    EDMUND TURNER.

    N.B. The signature bears the name of one who knows and felt the
    sting of Slavery; but now, thanks be to God, I am now where the
    poisonous breath taints not our air, but every one is sitting
    under his own vine and fig tree, where none dare to make him
    ashamed or afraid.

    EDMUND TURNER, formerly of Petersburg, Va.





    HAMILTON, June 22d, 1858, C.W.

    To MR. WM. STILL, DEAR SIR:--A favorable opportunity affords the
    pleasure of acknowledging the receipt of letters and papers;
    certainly in this region they were highly appreciated, and I
    hope the time may come that your kindness will be reciprocated
    we are al well at present, but times continue dull. I also
    deeply regret the excitement recently on the account of those
    slaves, you will favor me by keeping me posted upon the subject.
    Those words written to slaveholder is the thought of one who had
    sufferd, and now I thought it a duty incumbent upon me to cry
    aloud and spare not, &c., by sending these few lines where the
    slaveholder may hear. You will still further oblige your humble
    servant also, to correct any inaccuracy. My respects to you and
    your family and all inquiring friends.

    Your friend and well wisher,

    EDMUND TURNER.


The then impending judgments seen by an eye of faith as set forth in
this "Warning," soon fell with crushing weight upon the oppressor, and
Slavery died. But the old blind father of Jackson, Isaac and Edmondson,
still lives and may be seen daily on the streets of Philadelphia; and
though "halt, and lame, and blind, and poor," doubtless resulting from
his early oppression, he can thank God and rejoice that he has lived to
see Slavery abolished.



ROBERT BROWN, ALIAS THOMAS JONES.


CROSSING THE RIVER ON HORSEBACK IN THE NIGHT.


In very desperate straits many new inventions were sought after by
deep-thinking and resolute slaves, determined to be free at any cost.
But it must here be admitted, that, in looking carefully over the more
perilous methods resorted to, Robert Brown, alias Thomas Jones, stands
second to none, with regard to deeds of bold daring. This hero escaped
from Martinsburg, Va., in 1856. He was a man of medium size, mulatto,
about thirty-eight years of age, could read and write, and was naturally
sharp-witted. He had formerly been owned by Col. John F. Franie, whom
Robert charged with various offences of a serious domestic character.

Furthermore, he also alleged, that his "mistress was cruel to all the
slaves," declaring that "they (the slaves), could not live with her,"
that "she had to hire servants," etc.

In order to effect his escape, Robert was obliged to swim the Potomac
river on horseback, on Christmas night, while the cold, wind, storm, and
darkness were indescribably dismal. This daring bondman, rather than
submit to his oppressor any longer, perilled his life as above stated.
Where he crossed the river was about a half a mile wide. Where could be
found in history a more noble and daring struggle for Freedom?

The wife of his bosom and his four children, only five days before he
fled, were sold to a trader in Richmond, Va., for no other offence than
simply "because she had resisted" the lustful designs of her master,
being "true to her own companion." After this poor slave mother and her
children were cast into prison for sale, the husband and some of his
friends tried hard to find a purchaser in the neighborhood; but the
malicious and brutal master refused to sell her--wishing to gratify his
malice to the utmost, and to punish his victims all that lay in his
power, he sent them to the place above named.

In this trying hour, the severed and bleeding heart of the husband
resolved to escape at all hazards, taking with him a daguerreotype
likeness of his wife which he happened to have on hand, and a lock of
hair from her head, and from each of the children, as mementoes of his
unbounded (though sundered) affection for them.

After crossing the river, his wet clothing freezing to him, he rode all
night, a distance of about forty miles. In the morning he left his
faithful horse tied to a fence, quite broken down. He then commenced his
dreary journey on foot--cold and hungry--in a strange place, where it
was quite unsafe to make known his condition and wants. Thus for a day
or two, without food or shelter, he traveled until his feet were
literally worn out, and in this condition he arrived at Harrisburg,
where he found friends. Passing over many of the interesting incidents
on the road, suffice it to say, he arrived safely in this city, on New
Year's night, 1857, about two hours before day break (the telegraph
having announced his coming from Harrisburg), having been a week on the
way. The night he arrived was very cold; besides, the Underground train,
that morning, was about three hours behind time; in waiting for it,
entirely out in the cold, a member of the Vigilance Committee thought he
was frosted. But when he came to listen to the story of the Fugitive's
sufferings, his mind changed.

Scarcely had Robert entered the house of one of the Committee, where he
was kindly received, when he took from his pocket his wife's likeness,
speaking very touchingly while gazing upon it and showing it.
Subsequently, in speaking of his family, he showed the locks of hair
referred to, which he had carefully rolled up in paper separately.
Unrolling them, he said, "this is my wife's;" "this is from my oldest
daughter, eleven years old;" "and this is from my next oldest;" "and
this from the next," "and this from my infant, only eight weeks old."
These mementoes he cherished with the utmost care as the last remains of
his affectionate family. At the sight of these locks of hair so tenderly
preserved, the member of the Committee could fully appreciate the
resolution of the fugitive in plunging into the Potomac, on the back of
a dumb beast, in order to flee from a place and people who had made such
barbarous havoc in his household.

His wife, as represented by the likeness, was of fair complexion,
prepossessing, and good looking--perhaps not over thirty-three years of
age.

ANTHONY LONEY, ALIAS WILLIAM ARMSTEAD.


Anthony had been serving under the yoke of Warring Talvert, of Richmond,
Va. Anthony was of a rich black complexion, medium size, about
twenty-five years of age. He was intelligent, and a member of the
Baptist Church. His master was a member of the Presbyterian Church and
held family prayers with the servants. But Anthony believed seriously,
that his master was no more than a "whitened sepulchre," one who was
fond of saying, "Lord, Lord," but did not do what the Lord bade him,
consequently Anthony felt, that before the Great Judge his "master's
many prayers" would not benefit him, as long as he continued to hold his
fellow-men in bondage. He left a father, Samuel Loney, and mother,
Rebecca also, one sister and four brothers. His old father had bought
himself and was free; likewise his mother, being very old, had been
allowed to go free. Anthony escaped in May, 1857.

CORNELIUS SCOTT.


Cornelius took passage _per_ the Underground Rail Road, in March, 1857,
from the neighborhood of Salvington, Stafford county, Va. He stated that
he had been claimed by Henry L. Brooke, whom he declared to be a "hard
drinker and a hard swearer." Cornelius had been very much bleached by
the Patriarchal Institution, and he was shrewd enough to take advantage
of this circumstance. In regions of country where men were less critical
and less experienced than Southerners, as to how the bleaching process
was brought about, Cornelius Scott would have had no difficulty whatever
in passing for a white man of the most improved Anglo-Saxon type.
Although a young man only twenty-three years of age, and quite stout,
his fair complexion was decidedly against him. He concluded, that for
this very reason, he would not have been valued at more than five
hundred dollars in the market. He left his mother (Ann Stubbs, and half
brother, Isaiah), and traveled as a white man.

SAMUEL WILLIAMS, ALIAS JOHN WILLIAMS.


This candidate for Canada had the good fortune to escape the clutches of
his mistress, Mrs. Elvina Duncans, widow of the late Rev. James Duncans,
who lived near Cumberland, Md. He had very serious complaints to allege
against his mistress, "who was a member of the Presbyterian Church." To
use his own language, "the servants in the house were treated worse than
dogs." John was thirty-two years of age, dark chestnut color, well made,
prepossessing in appearance, and he "fled to keep from being sold." With
the Underground Rail Road he was "highly delighted." Nor was he less
pleased with the thought, that he had caused his mistress, who was "one
of the worst women who ever lived," to lose twelve hundred dollars by
him. He escaped in March, 1857. He did not admit that he loved slavery
any the better for the reason that his master was a preacher, or that
his mistress was the wife of a preacher. Although a common farm hand,
Samuel had common sense, and for a long time previous had been watching
closely the conduct of his mistress, and at the same time had been
laying his plans for escaping on the Underground Rail Road the first
chance.


    $100 REWARD!--My negro man Richard has been missing since Sunday
    night, March 22d. I will give $100 to any one who will secure
    him or deliver him to me. Richard is thirty years old, but looks
    older; very short legs, dark, but rather bright color, broad
    cheek bones, a respectful and serious manner, generally looks
    away when spoken to, small moustache and beard (but he may have
    them off). He is a remarkably intelligent man, and can turn his
    hand to anything. He took with him a bag made of Brussels
    carpet, with my name written in large, rough letters on the
    bottom, and a good stock of coarse and fine clothes, among them
    a navy cap and a low-crowned hat. He has been seen about New
    Kent C.H., and on the Pamunky river, and is no doubt trying to
    get off in some vessel bound North.

    J.W. RANDOLPH, Richmond, Va.

    Even at this late date, it may perhaps afford Mr. R. a degree of
    satisfaction to know what became of Richard; but if this should
    not be the case, Richard's children, or mother, or father, if
    they are living, may possibly see these pages, and thereby be
    made glad by learning of Richard's wisdom as a traveler, in the
    terrible days of slave-hunting. Consequently here is what was
    recorded of him, April 3d, 1857, at the Underground Rail Road
    Station, just before a free ticket was tendered him for Canada.
    "Richard is thirty-three years of age, small of stature, dark
    color, smart and resolute. He was owned by Captain Tucker, of
    the United States Navy, from whom he fled." He was "tired of
    serving, and wanted to marry," was the cause of his escape. He
    had no complaint of bad treatment to make against his owner;
    indeed he said, that he had been "used well all his life."
    Nevertheless, Richard felt that this Underground Rail Road was
    the "greatest road he ever saw."

    When the war broke out, Richard girded on his knapsack and went
    to help Uncle Sam humble Richmond and break the yoke.

BARNABY GRIGBY, ALIAS JOHN BOYER, AND MARY ELIZABETH, HIS WIFE; FRANK
WANZER, ALIAS ROBERT SCOTT; EMILY FOSTER, ALIAS ANN WOOD.



(TWO OTHERS WHO STARTED WITH THEM WERE CAPTURED.)


All these persons journeyed together from Loudon Co., Va. on horseback
and in a carriage for more than one hundred miles. Availing themselves
of a holiday and their master's horses and carriage, they as
deliberately started for Canada, as though they had never been taught
that it was their duty, as servants, to "obey their masters." In this
particular showing a most utter disregard of the interest of their
"kind-hearted and indulgent owners." They left home on Monday, Christmas
Eve, 1855, under the leadership of Frank Wanzer, and arrived in Columbia
the following Wednesday at one o'clock. As willfully as they had thus
made their way along, they had not found it smooth sailing by any means.
The biting frost and snow rendered their travel anything but agreeable.
Nor did they escape the gnawings of hunger, traveling day and night. And
whilst these "articles" were in the very act of running away with
themselves and their kind master's best horses and carriage--when about
one hundred miles from home, in the neighborhood of Cheat river,
Maryland, they were attacked by "six white men, and a boy," who,
doubtless, supposing that their intentions were of a "wicked and
unlawful character" felt it to be their duty in kindness to their
masters, if not to the travelers to demand of them an account of
themselves. In other words, the assailants positively commanded the
fugitives to "show what right" they possessed, to be found in a
condition apparently so unwarranted.

The _spokesman_ amongst the fugitives, affecting no ordinary amount of
dignity, told their assailants plainly, that "no gentleman would
interfere with persons riding along civilly"--not allowing it to be
supposed that they were slaves, of course. These "gentlemen," however,
were not willing to accept this account of the travelers, as their very
decided steps indicated. Having the law on their side, they were for
compelling the fugitives to surrender without further parley.

At this juncture, the fugitives verily believing that the time had
arrived for the practical use of their pistols and dirks, pulled them
out of their concealment--the young women as well as the young men--and
declared they would not be "taken!" One of the white men raised his gun,
pointing the muzzle directly towards one of the young women, with the
threat that he would "shoot," etc. "Shoot! shoot!! shoot!!!" she
exclaimed, with a double barrelled pistol in one hand and a long dirk
knife in the other, utterly unterrified and fully ready for a death
struggle. The male _leader_ of the fugitives by this time had "pulled
back the hammers" of his "pistols," and was about to fire! Their
adversaries seeing the weapons, and the unflinching determination on the
part of the _runaways_ to stand their ground, "spill blood, kill, or
die," rather than be "taken," very prudently "sidled over to the other
side of the road," leaving at least four of the victors to travel on
their way.

At this moment the four in the carriage lost sight of the two on
horseback. Soon after the separation they heard firing, but what the
result was, they knew not. They were fearful, however, that their
companions had been captured.

The following paragraph, which was shortly afterwards taken from a
Southern paper, leaves no room to doubt, as to the fate of the two.


    Six fugitive slaves from Virginia were arrested at the Maryland
    line, near Hood's Mill, on Christmas day, but, after a severe
    fight, four of them escaped and have not since been heard of.
    They came from Loudoun and Fauquier counties.

    [Illustration: ]


Though the four who were successful, saw no "severe fight," it is not
unreasonable to suppose, that there was a fight, nevertheless; but not
till after the number of the fugitives had been reduced to two, instead
of six. As chivalrous as slave-holders and slave-catchers were, they
knew the value of their precious lives and the fearful risk of
attempting a capture, when the numbers were equal.

The party in the carriage, after the conflict, went on their way
rejoicing.

The young men, one cold night, when they were compelled to take rest in
the woods and snow, in vain strove to keep the feet of their female
companions from freezing by lying on them; but the frost was merciless
and bit them severely, as their feet very plainly showed. The following
disjointed report was cut from the _Frederick (Md.) Examiner_, soon
after the occurrence took place:


    "Six slaves, four men and two women, fugitives from Virginia,
    having with them two spring wagons and four horses, came to
    Hood's Mill, on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, near the
    dividing line between Frederick and Carroll counties, on
    Christmas day. After feeding their animals, one of them told a
    Mr. Dixon whence they came; believing them to be fugitives, he
    spread the alarm, and some eight or ten persons gathered round
    to arrest them; but the negroes drawing revolvers and
    bowie-knives, kept their assailants at bay, until five of the
    party succeeded in escaping in one of the wagons, and as the
    last one jumped on a horse to flee, he was fired at, the load
    taking effect in the small of the back. The prisoner says he
    belongs to Charles W. Simpson, Esq., of Fauquier county, Va.,
    and ran away with the others on the preceding evening."


This report from the _Examiner_, while it is not wholly correct,
evidently relates to the fugitives above described. Why the reporter
made such glaring mistakes, may be accounted for on the ground that the
bold stand made by the fugitives was so bewildering and alarming, that
the "assailants" were not in a proper condition to make correct
statements. Nevertheless the _Examiner's_ report was preserved with
other records, and is here given for what it is worth.

These victors were individually noted on the Record thus: Barnaby was
owned by William Rogers, a farmer, who was considered a "moderate
slaveholder," although of late "addicted to intemperance." He was the
owner of about one "dozen head of slaves," and had besides a wife and
two children.

Barnaby's chances for making extra "change" for himself were never
favorable; sometimes of "nights" he would manage to earn a "trifle." He
was prompted to escape because he "wanted to live by the sweat of his
own brow," believing that all men ought so to live. This was the only
reason he gave for fleeing.

Mary Elizabeth had been owned by Townsend McVee (likewise a farmer), and
in Mary's judgment, he was "severe," but she added, "his wife made him
so." McVee owned about twenty-five slaves; "he hardly allowed them to
talk--would not allow them to raise chickens," and "only allowed Mary
three dresses a year;" the rest she had to get as she could. Sometimes
McVee would sell slaves--last year he sold two. Mary said that she could
not say anything good of her mistress. On the contrary, she declared
that her mistress "knew no mercy nor showed any favor."

It was on account of this "domineering spirit," that Mary was induced to
escape.

Frank was owned by Luther Sullivan, "the meanest man in Virginia," he
said; he treated his people just as bad as he could in every respect.
"Sullivan," added Frank, "would 'lowance the slaves and stint them to
save food and get rich," and "would sell and whip," etc. To Frank's
knowledge, he had sold some twenty-five head. "He sold my mother and her
two children to Georgia some four years previous." But the motive which
hurried Frank to make his flight was his laboring under the apprehension
that his master had some "pretty heavy creditors who might come on him
at any time." Frank, therefore, wanted to be from home in Canada when
these gentry should make their visit. My poor mother has been often
flogged by master, said Frank. As to his mistress, he said she was
"tolerably good."

Ann Wood was owned by McVee also, and was own sister to Elizabeth. Ann
very fully sustained her sister Elizabeth's statement respecting the
character of her master.

The above-mentioned four, were all young and likely. Barnaby was
twenty-six years of age, mulatto, medium size, and intelligent--his wife
was about twenty-four years of age, quite dark, good-looking, and of
pleasant appearance. Frank was twenty-five years of age, mulatto, and
very smart; Ann was twenty-two, good-looking, and smart. After their
pressing wants had been met by the Vigilance Committee, and after
partial recuperation from their hard travel, etc., they were forwarded
on to the Vigilance Committee in New York. In Syracuse, Frank (the
leader), who was engaged to Emily, concluded that the knot might as well
be tied on the U.G.R.R., although penniless, as to delay the matter a
single day longer. Doubtless, the bravery, struggles, and trials of
Emily throughout the journey, had, in his estimation, added not a little
to her charms. Thus after consulting with her on the matter, her
approval was soon obtained, she being too prudent and wise to refuse the
hand of one who had proved himself so true a friend to Freedom, as well
as so devoted to her. The twain were accordingly made one at the
U.G.R.R. Station, in Syracuse, by Superintendent--Rev. J.W. Loguen.
After this joyful event, they proceeded to Toronto, and were there
gladly received by the Ladies' Society for aiding colored refugees.

The following letter from Mrs. Agnes Willis, wife of the distinguished
Rev. Dr. Willis, brought the gratifying intelligence that these brave
young adventurers, fell into the hands of distinguished characters and
warm friends of Freedom:


    TORONTO, 28th January, Monday evening, 1856.

    MR. STILL, DEAR SIR:--I have very great pleasure in making you
    aware that the following respectable persons have arrived here
    in safety without being annoyed in any way after you saw them.
    The women, two of them, viz: Mrs. Greegsby and Mrs. Graham, have
    been rather ailing, but we hope they will very soon be well.
    They have been attended to by the Ladies' Society, and are most
    grateful for any attention they have received. The solitary
    person, Mrs. Graves, has also been attended to; also her box
    will be looked after. She is pretty well, but rather dull;
    however, she will get friends and feel more at home by and bye.
    Mrs. Wanzer is quite well; and also young William Henry
    Sanderson. They are all of them in pretty good spirits, and I
    have no doubt they will succeed in whatever business they take
    up. In the mean time the men are chopping wood, and the ladies
    are getting plenty sewing. We are always glad to see our colored
    refugees safe here. I remain, dear sir,

    yours respectfully,

    AGNES WILLIS,

    Treasurer to the Ladies' Society to aid colored refugees.


For a time Frank enjoyed his newly won freedom and happy bride with
bright prospects all around; but the thought of having left sisters and
other relatives in bondage was a source of sadness in the midst of his
joy. He was not long, however, in making up his mind that he would
deliver them or "die in the attempt." Deliberately forming his plans to
go South, he resolved to take upon himself the entire responsibility of
all the risks to be encountered. Not a word did he reveal to a living
soul of what he was about to undertake. With "twenty-two dollars" in
cash and "three pistols" in his pockets, he started in the lightning
train from Toronto for Virginia. On reaching Columbia in this State, he
deemed it not safe to go any further by public conveyance, consequently
he commenced his long journey on foot, and as he neared the slave
territory he traveled by night altogether. For two weeks, night and day,
he avoided trusting himself in any house, consequently was compelled to
lodge in the woods. Nevertheless, during that space of time he succeeded
in delivering one of his sisters and her husband, and another friend in
the bargain. You can scarcely imagine the Committee's amazement on his
return, as they looked upon him and listened to his "noble deeds of
daring" and his triumph. A more brave and self-possessed man they had
never seen.

He knew what Slavery was and the dangers surrounding him on his mission,
but possessing true courage unlike most men, he pictured no alarming
difficulties in a distance of nearly one thousand miles by the mail
route, through the enemy's country, where he might have in truth said,
"I could not pass without running the gauntlet of mobs and assassins,
prisons and penitentiaries, bailiffs and constables, &c." If this hero
had dwelt upon and magnified the obstacles in his way he would most
assuredly have kept off the enemy's country, and his sister and friends
would have remained in chains.

The following were the persons delivered by Frank Wanzer. They were his
trophies, and this noble act of Frank's should ever be held as a
memorial and honor. The Committee's brief record made on their arrival
runs thus:

"August 18, 1856. Frank Wanzer, Robert Stewart, alias Gasberry Robison,
Vincent Smith, alias John Jackson, Betsey Smith, wife of Vincent Smith,
alias Fanny Jackson. They all came from Alder, Loudon county, Virginia."

Robert is about thirty years of age, medium size, dark chestnut color,
intelligent and resolute. He was held by the widow Hutchinson, who was
also the owner of about one hundred others. Robert regarded her as a
"very hard mistress" until the death of her husband, which took place
the Fall previous to his escape. That sad affliction, he thought, was
the cause of a considerable change in her treatment of her slaves. But
yet "nothing was said about freedom," on her part. This reticence Robert
understood to mean, that she was still unconverted on this great
cardinal principle at least. As he could see no prospect of freedom
through her agency, when Frank approached him with a good report from
Canada and his friends there, he could scarcely wait to listen to the
glorious news; he was so willing and anxious to get out of slavery. His
dear old mother, Sarah Davis, and four brothers and two sisters,
William, Thomas, Frederick and Samuel, Violet and Ellen, were all owned
by Mrs. Hutchinson. Dear as they were to him, he saw no way to take them
with him, nor was he prepared to remain a day longer under the yoke; so
he decided to accompany Frank, let the cost be what it might.

Vincent is about twenty-three years of age, very "likely-looking," dark
color, and more than ordinarily intelligent for one having only the
common chances of slaves.

He was owned by the estate of Nathan Skinner, who was "looked upon," by
those who knew him, "as a good slave-holder." In slave property,
however, he was only interested to the number of twelve head. Skinner
"neither sold nor emancipated." A year and a half before Vincent
escaped, his master was called to give an account of his stewardship,
and there in the spirit land Vincent was willing to let him remain,
without much more to add about him.

Vincent left his mother, Judah Smith, and brothers and sisters, Edwin,
Angeline, Sina Ann, Adaline Susan, George, John and Lewis, all belonging
to the estate of Skinner.

Vincent was fortunate enough to bring his wife along with him. She was
about twenty-seven years of age, of a brown color, and smart, and was
owned by the daughter of the widow Hutchinson. This mistress was said to
be a "clever woman."

WILLIAM JORDON, ALIAS WILLIAM PRICE


Under Governor Badger, of North Carolina, William had experienced
Slavery in its most hateful form. True, he had only been twelve months
under the yoke of this high functionary. But William's experience in
this short space of time, was of a nature very painful.

Previous to coming into the governor's hands, William was held as the
property of Mrs. Mary Jordon, who owned large numbers of slaves. Whether
the governor was moved by this consideration, or by the fascinating
charms of Mrs. Jordon, or both, William was not able to decide. But the
governor offered her his hand, and they became united in wedlock. By
this circumstance, William was brought into his unhappy relations with
the Chief Magistrate of the State of North Carolina. This was the third
time the governor had been married. Thus it may be seen, that the
governor was a firm believer in wives as well as slaves. Commonly he was
regarded as a man of wealth. William being an intelligent piece of
property, his knowledge of the governor's rules and customs was quite
complete, as he readily answered such questions as were propounded to
him. In this way a great amount of interesting information was learned
from William respecting the governor, slaves, on the plantation, in the
swamps, etc. The governor owned large plantations, and was interested in
raising cotton, corn, and peas, and was also a practical planter. He was
willing to trust neither overseers nor slaves any further than he could
help.

The governor and his wife were both equally severe towards them; would
stint them shamefully in clothing and food, though they did not get
flogged quite as often as some others on neighboring plantations.
Frequently, the governor would be out on the plantation from early in
the morning till noon, inspecting the operations of the overseers and
slaves.

In order to serve the governor, William had been separated from his wife
by sale, which was the cause of his escape. He parted not with his
companion willingly. At the time, however, he was promised that he
should have some favors shown him;--could make over-work, and earn a
little money, and once or twice in the year, have the opportunity of
making visits to her. Two hundred miles was the distance between them.

He had not been long on the governor's plantation before his honor gave
him distinctly to understand that the idea of his going two hundred
miles to see his wife was all nonsense, and entirely out of the
question. "If I said so, I did not mean it," said his honor, when the
slave, on a certain occasion, alluded to the conditions on which he
consented to leave home, etc.

Against this cruel decision of the governor, William's heart revolted,
for he was warmly attached to his wife, and so he made up his mind, if
he could not see her "once or twice a year even," as he had been
promised, he had rather "die," or live in a "cave in the wood," than to
remain all his life under the governor's yoke. Obeying the dictates of
his feelings, he went to the woods. For ten months before he was
successful in finding the Underground Road, this brave-hearted young
fugitive abode in the swamps--three months in a cave--surrounded with
bears, wild cats, rattle-snakes and the like.

While in the swamps and cave, he was not troubled, however, about
ferocious animals and venomous reptiles. He feared only man!

From his own story there was no escaping the conclusion, that if the
choice had been left to him, he would have preferred at any time to have
encountered at the mouth of his cave a ferocious bear than his master,
the governor of North Carolina. How he managed to subsist, and
ultimately effected his escape, was listened to with the deepest
interest, though the recital of these incidents must here be very brief.

After night he would come out of his cave, and, in some instances, would
succeed in making his way to a plantation, and if he could get nothing
else, he would help himself to a "pig," or anything else he could
conveniently convert into food. Also, as opportunity would offer, a
friend of his would favor him with some meal, etc. With this mode of
living he labored to content himself until he could do better. During
these ten months he suffered indescribable hardships, but he felt that
his condition in the cave was far preferable to that on the plantation,
under the control of his Excellency, the Governor. All this time,
however, William had a true friend, with whom he could communicate; one
who was wide awake, and was on the alert to find a reliable captain from
the North, who would consent to take this "property," or "freight," for
a consideration. He heard at last of a certain Captain, who was then
doing quite a successful business in an Underground way. This good news
was conveyed to William, and afforded him a ray of hope in the
wilderness. As Providence would have it, his hope did not meet with
disappointment; nor did his ten months' trial, warring against the
barbarism of Slavery, seem too great to endure for Freedom. He was about
to leave his cave and his animal and reptile neighbors,--his heart
swelling with gladness,--but the thought of soon being beyond the reach
of his mistress and master thrilled him with inexpressible delight. He
was brought away by Captain F., and turned over to the Committee, who
were made to rejoice with him over the signal victory he had gained in
his martyr-like endeavors to throw off the yoke, and of course they took
much pleasure in aiding him. William was of a dark color, stout made
physically, and well knew the value of Freedom, and how to hate and
combat Slavery. It will be seen by the appended letter of Thomas
Garrett, that William had the good luck to fall into the hands of this
tried friend, by whom he was aided to Philadelphia:


    WILMINGTON, 12th mo., 19th, 1855.

    DEAR FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--The bearer of this is one of the
    twenty-one that I thought had all gone North; he left home on
    Christmas day, one year since, wandered about the forests of
    North Carolina for about ten months, and then came here with
    those forwarded to New Bedford, where he is anxious to go. I
    have furnished him with a pretty good pair of boots, and gave
    him money to pay his passage to Philadelphia. He has been at
    work in the country near here for some three weeks, till taken
    sick; he is, by no means, well, but thinks he had better try to
    get farther North, which I hope his friends in Philadelphia will
    aid him to do. I handed this morning Captain Lambson's[A] wife
    twenty dollars to help fee a lawyer to defend him. She leaves
    this morning, with her child, for Norfolk, to be at the trial
    before the Commissioner on the 24th instant. Passmore Williamson
    agreed to raise fifty dollars for him. As none came to hand, and
    a good chance to send it by his wife, I thought best to advance
    that much.

    [Footnote A: Captain Lambson had been suspected of having aided
    in the escape of slaves from the neighborhood of Norfolk, and
    was in prison awaiting his trial.]

    Thy friend,

    THOS. GARRETT.




JOSEPH GRANT AND JOHN SPEAKS.


TWO PASSENGERS ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD, VIA LIVERPOOL.


It is to be regretted that, owing to circumstances, the account of these
persons has not been fully preserved. Could justice be done them,
probably their narratives would not be surpassed in interest by any
other in the history of fugitives. In 1857, when these remarkable
travelers came under the notice of the Vigilance Committee, as Slavery
seemed likely to last for generations, and there was but little
expectation that these records would ever have the historical value
which they now possess, care was not always taken to prepare and
preserve them. Besides, the cases coming under the notice of the
Committee, were so numerous and so interesting, that it seemed almost
impossible to do them anything like justice. In many instances the rapt
attention paid by friends, when listening to the sad recitals of such
passengers, would unavoidably consume so much time that but little
opportunity was afforded to make any record of them. Particularly was
this the case with regard to the above-mentioned individuals. The story
of each was so long and sad, that a member of the Committee in
attempting to write it out, found that the two narratives would take
volumes. That all traces, of these heroes might not be lost, a mere
fragment is all that was preserved.

The original names of these adventurers, were Joseph Grant and John
Speaks. Between two and three years before escaping, they were sold from
Maryland to John B. Campbell a negro trader, living in Baltimore, and
thence to Campbell's brother, another trader in New Orleans, and
subsequently to Daniel McBeans and Mr. Henry, of Harrison county,
Mississippi.

Though both had to pass through nearly the same trial, and belonged to
the same masters, this recital must be confined chiefly to the incidents
in the career of Joseph. He was about twenty-seven years of age, well
made, quite black, intelligent and self-possessed in his manner.

He was owned in Maryland by Mrs. Mary Gibson, who resided at St.
Michael's on the Eastern Shore. She was a _nice woman_ he said, but her
property was under mortgage and had to be sold, and he was in danger of
sharing the same fate.

Joseph was a married man, and spoke tenderly of his wife. She "promised"
him when he was sold that she would "never marry," and earnestly
entreated him, if he "ever met with the luck, to come and see her." She
was unaware perhaps at that time of the great distance that was to
divide them; his feelings on being thus sundered need not be stated.
However, he had scarcely been in Mississippi three weeks, ere his desire
to return to his wife, and the place of his nativity constrained him to
attempt to return; accordingly he set off, crossing a lake eighty miles
wide in a small boat, he reached Kent Island. There he was captured by
the watchman on the Island, who with _pistols, dirk and cutlass_ in
hand, threatened if he resisted that death would be his instant doom. Of
course he was returned to his master.

He remained there a few months, but could content himself no longer to
endure the ills of his condition. So he again started for home, walked
to Mobile, and thence he succeeded in stowing himself away in a
steamboat and was thus conveyed to Montgomery, a distance of five
hundred and fifty miles through solid slave territory. Again he was
captured and returned to his owners; one of whom always went for
immediate punishment, the other being mild thought persuasion the better
plan in such cases. On the whole, Joseph thus far had been pretty
fortunate, considering the magnitude of his offence.

A third time he summoned courage and steered his course homewards
towards Maryland, but as in the preceding attempts, he was again
unsuccessful.

In this instance Mr. Henry, the harsh owner, was exasperated, and the
mild one's patience so exhausted that they concluded that nothing short
of stern measures would cause Joe to reform. Said Mr. Henry; "_I had
rather lose my right arm than for him to get off without being punished,
after having put us to so much trouble_."

_Joseph_ will now speak for himself.

"He (master) sent the overseer to tie me. I told him I would not be
tied. I ran and stayed away four days, which made Mr. Henry very
anxious. Mr. Beans told the servants if they saw me, to tell me to come
back and I should not be hurt. Thinking that Mr. Beans had always stood
to his word, I was over persuaded and came back. He sent for me in his
parlor, talked the matter over, sent me to the steamboat (perhaps the
one he tried to escape on.) After getting cleverly on board the captain
told me, I am sorry to tell you, you have to be tied. I was tied and Mr.
Henry was sent for. He came; 'Well, I have got you at last, beg my
pardon and promise you will never run away again and I will not be so
hard on you.' I could not do it. He then gave me three hundred lashes
well laid on. I was stripped entirely naked, and my flesh was as raw as
a piece of beef. He made John (the companion who escaped with him) hold
one of my feet which I broke loose while being whipped, and when done
made him bathe me in salt and water.

"Then I resolved to 'go or die' in the attempt. Before starting, one
week, I could not work. On getting better we went to Ship Island; the
sailors, who were Englishmen, were very sorry to hear of the treatment
we had received, and counselled us how we might get free."

The counsel was heeded, and in due time they found themselves in
Liverpool. There their stay was brief. Utterly destitute of money,
education, and in a strange land, they very naturally turned their eyes
again in the direction of their native land. Accordingly their host, the
keeper of a sailor's boarding-house, shipped them to Philadelphia.

But to go back, Joseph saw many things in New Orleans and Mississippi of
a nature too horrible to relate, among which were the following:

I have seen Mr. Beans whip one of his slaves to death, at the tree to
which he was tied.

Mr. Henry would make them lie down across a log, stripped naked, and
with every stroke would lay the flesh open. Being used to it, some would
lie on the log without being tied.

In New Orleans, I have seen women stretched out just as naked as my
hand, on boxes, and given one hundred and fifty lashes, four men holding
them. I have helped hold them myself: when released they could hardly
sit or walk. This whipping was at the "_Fancy House_."

The "chain-gangs" he also saw in constant operation. Four and five
slaves chained together and at work on the streets, cleaning, &c., was a
common sight. He could hardly tell Sunday from Monday in New Orleans,
the slaves were kept so constantly going.

WILLIAM N. TAYLOR.



    ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD.--Ran away from Richmond City on
    Tuesday, the 2d of June, a negro man named WM. N. TAYLOR,
    belonging to Mrs. Margaret Tyler of Hanover county.

    [Illustration: ]

    Said negro was hired to Fitzhugh Mayo, Tobacconist; is quite
    black, of genteel and easy manners, about five feet ten or
    eleven inches high, has one front tooth broken, and is about 35
    years old.

    He is supposed either to have made his escape North, or
    attempted to do so. The above reward will be paid for his
    delivery to Messrs. Hill and Rawlings, in Richmond, or secured
    in jail, so that I get him again.

    JAS. G. TYLER, Trustee for Margaret Tyler.

    June 8th &c2t--

    _Richmond Enquirer, June 9, 57_.


William unquestionably possessed a fair share of common sense, and just
enough distaste to Slavery to arouse him most resolutely to seek his
freedom.

The advertisement of James G. Tyler was not altogether accurate with
regard to his description of William; but notwithstanding, in handing
William down to posterity, the description of Tyler has been adopted
instead of the one engrossed in the records by the Committee. But as a
simple matter of fair play, it seems fitting, that the description given
by William, while on the Underground Rail Road, of his master, &c.,
should come in just here.

William acknowledged that he was the property of Walter H. Tyler,
brother of EX-PRESIDENT TYLER, who was described as follows: "He
(master) was about sixty-five years of age; was a barbarous man, very
intemperate, horse racer, chicken-cock fighter and gambler. He had owned
as high as forty head of slaves, but he had gambled them all away. He
was a doctor, circulated high amongst southerners, though he never lived
agreeably with his wife, would curse her and call her all kinds of names
that he should not call a lady. From a boy of nine up to the time I was
fifteen or sixteen, I don't reckon he whipped me less than a hundred
times. He shot at me once with a double-barrelled gun.

"What made me leave was because I worked for him all my life-time and he
never gave me but two dollars and fifteen cents in all his life. I was
hired out this year for two hundred dollars, but when I would go to him
to make complaints of hard treatment from the man I was hired to, he
would say: "G----d d----n it, don't come to me, all I want is my money."

"Mr. Tyler was a thin raw-boned man, with a long nose, the picture of
the president. His wife was a tolerably well-disposed woman in some
instances--she was a tall, thin-visaged woman, and stood high in the
community. Through her I fell into the hands of Tyler. At present she
owns about fifty slaves. His own slaves, spoken of as having been
gambled away, came by his father--he has been married the second time."

Twice William had been sold and bought in, on account of his master's
creditors, and for many months had been expecting to be sold again, to
meet pressing claims in the hands of the sheriff against Tyler. He, by
the way, "now lives in Hanover county, about eighteen miles from
Richmond, and for fear of the sheriff, makes himself very scarce in that
city."

At fourteen years of age, William was sold for eight hundred dollars; he
would have brought in 1857, probably twelve hundred and fifty dollars;
he was a member of the Baptist Church in good and regular standing.

LOUISA BROWN.


Louisa is a good-looking, well-grown, intelligent mulatto girl of
sixteen years of age, and was owned by a widow woman of Baltimore, Md.
To keep from being sold, she was prompted to try her fortune on the
U.G.R.R., for Freedom in Canada, under the protection of the British
Lion.

JACOB WATERS AND ALFRED GOULDEN.


Jacob is twenty-one years of age, dark chestnut color, medium size, and
of prepossessing manners. Fled from near Frederick, Md., from the
clutches of a farmer by the name of William Dorsey, who was described as
a severe master, and had sold two of Jacob's sisters, South, only three
years prior to his escape. Jacob left three brothers in chains.

Alfred is twenty-three years of age, in stature quite small, full black,
and bears the marks of ill usage. Though a member of the Methodist
Church, his master, Fletcher Jackson, "thought nothing of taking the
shovel to Alfred's head; or of knocking him, and stamping his head with
the heels of his boots." Repeatedly, of late, he had been shockingly
beaten. To escape those terrible visitations, therefore, he made up his
mind to seek a refuge in Canada.

ARRIVAL FROM BALTIMORE.


JEFFERSON PIPKINS, ALIAS DAVID JONES, LOUISA PIPKINS, ELIZABETH BRIT,
HARRIET BROWN, ALIAS JANE WOOTON, GRACY MURRY, ALIAS SOPHIA SIMS, EDWARD
WILLIAMS, ALIAS HENRY JOHNSON, CHAS. LEE, ALIAS THOMAS BUSHIER.


Six very clever-looking passengers, all in one party from Baltimore,
Md., the first Sunday in April, 1853. Baltimore used to be in the days
of Slavery one of the most difficult places in the South for even free
colored people to get away from, much more for slaves. The rule forbade
any colored person leaving there by rail road or steamboat, without such
applicant had been weighed, measured, and then given a bond signed by
unquestionable signatures, well known. Baltimore was rigid in the
extreme, and was a never-failing source of annoyance, trouble and
expense to colored people generally, and not unfrequently to
slave-holders too, when they were traveling North with "colored
servants." Just as they were ready to start, the "Rules" would forbid
colored servants until the law was complied with. Parties hurrying on
would on account of this obstruction "have to wait until their hurry was
over." As this was all done in the interest of Slavery, the matter was
not very loudly condemned. But, notwithstanding all this weighing,
measuring and requiring of bonds, many travelers by the Underground Rail
Road took passage from Baltimore.

The enterprising individual, whose name stands at the head of this
narrative, came directly from this stronghold of Slavery. The widow
Pipkins held the title deed for Jefferson. She was unfortunate in losing
him, as she was living in ease and luxury off of Jefferson's sweat and
labor. Louisa, Harriet and Grace owed service to Geo. Stewart of
Baltimore; Edward was owned by Chas. Moondo, and Chas. Lee by the above
Stewart.

Those who would have taken this party for stupid, or for know-nothings,
would have found themselves very much mistaken. Indeed they were far
from being dull or sleepy on the subject of Slavery at any rate. They
had considered pretty thoroughly how wrongfully they, with all others in
similar circumstances, had been year in and year out subjected to
unrequited toil so resolved to leave masters and mistresses to shift for
themselves, while they would try their fortunes in Canada.

Four of the party ranged in age from twenty to twenty-eight years of
age, and the other two from thirty-seven to forty. The Committee on whom
they called, rendered them due aid and advice, and forwarded them to the
Committee in New York.

The following letter from Jefferson, appealing for assistance on behalf
of his children in Slavery, was peculiarly touching, as were all similar
letters. But the mournful thought that these appeals, sighs, tears and
prayers would continue in most cases to be made till death, that nothing
could be done directly for the deliverance of such sufferers was often
as painful as the escape from the auction block was gratifying.



LETTER FROM JEFFERSON PIPKINS.



    Sept. 28, 1856.

    To WM. STILL. SIR:--I take the liberty of writing to you a few
    lines concerning my children, for I am very anxious to get them
    and I wish you to please try what you can do for me. Their names
    are Charles and Patrick and are living with Mrs. Joseph G. Wray
    Murphysborough Hartford county, North Carolina; Emma lives with
    a Lawyer Baker in Gatesville North Carolina and Susan lives in
    Portsmouth Virginia and is stopping with Dr. Collins sister a
    Mrs. Nash you can find her out by enquiring for Dr. Collins at
    the ferry boat at Portsmouth, and Rose a coloured woman at the
    Crawford House can tell where she is. And I trust you will try
    what you think will be the best way. And you will do me a great
    favour.

    Yours Respectfully,

    JEFFERSON PIPKINS.

    P.S. I am living at Yorkville near Toronto Canada West. My wife
    sends her best respects to Mrs. Still.

SEVERAL ARRIVALS FROM DIFFERENT PLACES.


In order to economize time and space, with a view to giving an account
of as many of the travelers as possible, it seems expedient, where a
number of arrivals come in close proximity to each other, to report them
briefly, under one head.

Henry Anderson, _alias_ WILLIAM ANDERSON. In outward appearance Henry
was uninteresting. As he asserted, and as his appearance indicated, he
had experienced a large share of "rugged" usage. Being far in the South,
and in the hands of a brutal "Captain of a small boat," chances of
freedom or of moderate treatment, had rarely ever presented themselves
in any aspect. On the 3d of the preceding March he was sold to a negro
trader--the thought of having to live under a trader was so terrible, he
was moved to escape, leaving his wife, to whom he had only been married
three months. Henry was twenty-five years of age, quite black and a
little below the medium size.

He fled from Beaufort, North Carolina. The system of slavery in all the
region of country whence Henry came, exhibited generally great brutality
and cruelty.

CHARLES CONGO AND WIFE, MARGARET. Charles and his wife were fortunate in
managing to flee together. Their attachment to each other was evidently
true. They were both owned by a farmer, who went by the name of David
Stewart, and resided in Maryland. As Charles' owner did not require
their services at home, as he had more of that kind of stock than he had
use for--he hired them out to another farmer--Charles for $105 per
annum; how much for the wife they could not tell. She, however, was not
blessed with good health, though she was not favored any more on that
account. Charles' affection for his wife, on seeing how hard she had to
labor when not well, aroused him to seek their freedom by flight. He
resolved to spare no pains, to give himself no rest until they were both
free. Accordingly the Underground Rail Road was sought and found.
Charles was twenty-eight, with a good head and striking face, as well as
otherwise well made; chestnut color and intelligent, though unable to
read. Left two sisters in bondage. Margaret was about the same age as
her husband, a nice-looking brown-skinned woman; worth $500. Charles was
valued at $1200.

The atmosphere throughout the neighborhood where Charles and Margaret
had lived and breathed, and had their existence, was heavily oppressed
with slavery. No education for the freeman of color, much less for the
slave. The order of the day was literally, as far as colored men were
concerned: "No rights which white men were bound to respect."

Chaskey Brown, Wm. Henry Washington, James Alfred Frisley, and Charles
Henry Salter. Chaskey is about twenty-four years of age, quite black,
medium size, sound body and intelligent appearance, nevertheless he
resembled a "farm hand" in every particular. His master was known by the
name of Major James H. Gales, and he was the owner of a farm with
eighteen men, women and children, slaves to toil for him. The Major in
disposition was very abusive and profane, though old and grey-headed.
His wife was pretty much the same kind of a woman as he was a man; one
who delighted in making the slaves tremble at her bidding. Chaskey was a
member of the "Still Pond church," of Kent county, Md. Often Chaskey was
made to feel the lash on his back, notwithstanding his good standing in
the church. He had a wife and one child. In escaping, he was obliged to
leave them both. Chaskey was valued at $1200.

William Henry was about 20 years of age, and belonged to Doctor B.
Grain, of Baltimore, who hired him out to a farmer. Not relishing the
idea of having to work all his life in bondage, destitute of all
privileges, he resolved to seek a refuge in Canada. He left his mother,
four sisters and two brothers.

James is twenty-four years of age, well made, quite black and pretty
shrewd. He too was unable to see how it was that he should be worked,
and flogged, and sold, at the pleasure of his master and "getting
nothing;" he "had rather work for himself." His master was a
"_speckled-faced--pretty large stomach man_, but was not very abuseful."
He only owned one other.

Charles Henry is about thirty years of age, of good proportion,
nice-looking and intelligent; but to rough usage he was no stranger. To
select his own master was a privilege not allowed; privileges of all
kinds were rare with him. So he resolved to flee. Left his mother, three
sisters and five brothers in slavery. He was a member of "Albany
Chapel," at Massey's Cross Roads, and a slave of Dr. B. Crain. Charles
left his wife Anna, living near the head of Sassafras, Md. The
separation was painful, as was everything belonging to the system of
Slavery.

These were all gladly received by the Vigilance Committee, and the hand
of friendship warmly extended to them; and the best of counsel and
encouragement was offered; material aid, food and clothing were also
furnished as they had need, and they were sent on their way rejoicing to
Canada.

Stephen Taylor, Charles Brown, Charles Henry Hollis, and Luther Dorsey.
Stephen was a fine young man, of twenty years of age; he fled to keep
from being sold. He "supposed his master wanted money." His master was a
"tall, spare-faced man, with long whiskers, very wicked and very
quick-tempered," and was known by the name of James Smithen, of Sandy
Hook, Harford county, Md. His wife was also a very "close woman." They
had four children growing up to occupy their places as oppressors.
Stephen was not satisfied to serve either old or young masters any
longer, and made up his mind to leave the first opportunity. Before this
watchful and resolute purpose the way opened, and he soon found it
comparatively easy to find his way from Maryland to Pennsylvania, and
likewise into the hands of the Vigilance Committee, to whom he made
known fully the character of the place and people whence he had fled,
the dangers he was exposed to from slave-hunters, and the strong hope he
cherished of reaching free land soon. Being a young man of promise,
Stephen was advised earnestly to apply his mind to seek an education,
and to use every possible endeavor to raise himself in the scale of
manhood, morally, religiously and intellectually; and he seemed to drink
in the admonitions thus given with a relish. After recruiting, and all
necessary arrangements had been made for his comfort and passage to
Canada, he was duly forwarded. "One more slave-holder is minus another
slave worth at least $1200, which is something to rejoice over," said
Committee. Stephen's parents were dead; one brother was the only near
relative he left in chains.

Charles Brown was about twenty-five years of age, quite black, and bore
the marks of having been used hard, though his stout and hearty
appearance would have rendered him very desirable to a trader. He fled
from William Wheeling, of Sandy Hook, Md. He spoke of his master as a
"pretty bad man," who was "always quarreling," and "would drink, swear
and lie." Left simply because he "never got anything for his labor." On
taking his departure for Canada, he was called upon to bid adieu to his
mother and three brothers, all under the yoke. His master he describes
thus--

"His face was long, cheek-bones high, middling tall, and about
twenty-six years of age." With this specimen of humanity, Charles was
very much dissatisfied, and he made up his mind not to stand the burdens
of Slavery a day longer than he could safely make his way to the North.
And in making an effort to reach Canada, he was quite willing to suffer
many things. So the first chance Charles got, he started, and Providence
smiled upon his resolution; he found himself a joyful passenger on the
Underground Rail Road, being entertained free, and receiving attentions
from the Company all along the line through to her British Majesty's
boundlessly free territory in the Canadas.

True, the thought of his mother and brothers, left in the prison house,
largely marred his joy, as it did also the Committee's, still the
Committee felt that Charles had gained his Freedom honorably, and at the
same time, had left his master a poorer, if not a wiser man, by at least
$1200.

Charles Henry was a good-looking young man, only twenty years of age,
and appeared to possess double as much natural sense as he would require
to take care of himself. John Webster of Sandy Hook, claimed Charles'
time, body and mind, and this was what made Charles unhappy. Uneducated
as he was, he was too sensible to believe that Webster had any God-given
right to his manhood. Consequently, he left because his master "did not
treat him right."  Webster was a tall man, with large black whiskers,
about forty years of age, and owned Charles' two sisters. Charles was
sorry for the fate of his sisters, but he could not help them if he
remained. Staying to wear the yoke, he felt would rather make it worse
instead of better for all concerned.

Luther Dorsey is about nineteen years of age, rather smart, black, well
made and well calculated for a Canadian. He was prompted to escape
purely from the desire to be "_free_." He fled from a "very insulting
man," by the name of Edward Schriner, from the neighborhood of
Sairsville Mills, Frederick Co., Md. This Schriner was described as a
"low chunky man, with grum look, big mouth, etc.," and was a member of
the German Reformed Church. "Don't swear, though might as well; he was
so bad other ways."

Luther was a member of the Methodist church at Jones Hill. Left his
father in chains; his mother had wisely escaped to Canada years back,
when he was but a boy. Where she was then, he could not tell, but hoped

ARRIVAL FROM RICHMOND.


JEREMIAH W. SMITH AND WIFE JULIA.


Richmond was a city noted for its activity and enterprise in slave
trade. Several slave pens and prisons were constantly kept up to
accommodate the trade. And slave auctions were as common in Richmond as
dress goods auctions in Philadelphia; notwithstanding this fact, strange
as it may seem, the Underground Rail Road brought away large numbers of
passengers from Richmond, Petersburg and Norfolk, and not a few of them
lived comparatively within a hair's breadth of the auction block. Many
of those from these localities were amongst the most intelligent and
respectable slaves in the South, and except at times when disheartened
by some grave disaster which had befallen the road, as, for instance,
when some friendly captain or conductor was discovered in aiding
fugitives, many of the thinking bondmen were daily manoeuvering and
watching for opportunities to escape or aid their friends so to do. This
state of things of course made the naturally hot blood of Virginians
fairly boil. They had preached long and loudly about the contented and
happy condition of the slaves,--that the chief end of the black man was
to worship and serve the white man, with joy and delight, with more
willingness and obedience indeed than he would be expected to serve his
Maker. So the slave-holders were utterly at a loss to account for the
unnatural desire on the part of the slaves to escape to the North where
they affirmed they would be far less happy in freedom than in the hands
of those so "kind and indulgent towards them." Despite all this, daily
the disposition increased, with the more intelligent slaves, to distrust
the statements of their masters especially when they spoke against the
North. For instance if the master was heard to curse Boston the slave
was then satisfied that Boston was just the place he would like to go
to; or if the master told the slave that the blacks in Canada were
freezing and starving to death by hundreds, his hope of trying to reach
Canada was made tenfold stronger; he was willing to risk all the
starving and freezing that the country could afford; his eagerness to
find a conductor then would become almost painful.

The situations of Jeremiah and Julia Smith, however, were not considered
very hard, indeed they had fared rather better than most slaves in
Virginia, nevertheless it will be seen that they desired to better their
condition, to keep off of the auction-block at least. Jeremiah could
claim to have no mixture in his blood, as his color was of such a pure
black; but with the way of the world, in respect to shrewdness and
intelligence, he had evidently been actively conversant. He was about
twenty-six years of age, and in stature only medium, with poor health.

The name of James Kinnard, whom he was obliged to call master and serve,
was disgusting to him. Kinnard, he said, was a "close and severe man."
At the same time he was not considered by the community "a hard man."
From the age of fifteen years Jeremiah had been hired out, for which his
owner had received from $50 to $130 per annum. In consequence of his
master's custom of thus letting out Jeremiah, the master had avoided
doctors' bills, &c. For the last two years prior to his escape, however,
Jeremiah's health had been very treacherous, in consequence of which the
master had been compelled to receive only $50 a year, sick or well.
About one month before Jeremiah left, he was to have been taken on his
master's farm, with the hope that he could be made more profitable there
than he was in being hired out.

His owner had thought once of selling him, perhaps fearing that Jeremiah
might unluckily die on his hands. So he put him in prison and
advertised; but as he had the asthma pretty badly at that time, he was
not saleable, the traders even declined to buy him.

While these troubles were presenting themselves to Jeremiah, Julia, his
wife, was still more seriously involved, which added to Jeremiah's
perplexities, of course.

Julia was of a dark brown color, of medium size, and thirty years of
age. Fourteen years she had been the slave of A. Judson Crane, and under
him she had performed the duties of nurse, chamber-maid, etc.,
"faithfully and satisfactorily," as the certificate furnished her by
this owner witnessed. She actually possessing a certificate, which he,
Crane, gave her to enable her to find a new master, as she was then
about to be sold. Her master had experienced a failure in business. This
was the reason why she was to be sold.

Mrs. Crane, her mistress, had always promised Julia that she should be
free at her death. But, unexpectedly, as Mrs. Crane was on her journey
home from Cape May, where she had been for her health the summer before
Julia escaped, she died suddenly in Philadelphia. Julia, however, had
been sold twice before her mistress' death; once to the trader, Reed,
and afterwards to John Freeland, and again was on the eve of being sold.
Freeland, her last owner, thought she was unhappy because she was denied
the privilege of going home of nights to her husband, instead of being
on hand at the beck and call of her master and mistress day and night.
So the very day Julia and her husband escaped, arrangements had been
made to put her up at auction a third time. But both Julia and her
husband had seen enough of Slavery to leave no room to hope that they
could ever find peace or rest so long as they remained. So there and
then, they resolved to strike for Canada, via the Underground Rail Road.
By a little good management, berths were procured for them on one of the
Richmond steamers (berths not known to the officers of the boat), and
they were safely landed in the hands of the Vigilance Committee, and a
most agreeable interview was had.

The Committee extended to them the usual hospitalities, in the way of
board, accommodations, and free tickets Canadaward, and wished them a
safe and speedy passage. The passengers departed, exceedingly
light-hearted, Feb. 1, 1854.

EIGHT ARRIVALS:


JAMES MASSEY, PERRY HENRY TRUSTY, GEORGE RHOADS, JAMES RHOADS, GEORGE
WASHINGTON, SARAH ELIZABETH RHOADS AND CHILD, MARY ELIZABETH STEVENSON.


Doubtless there was a sensation in "the camp," when this gang was found
missing.

James was a likely-looking young man of twenty years of age, dark, tall,
and sensible; and worth, if we may judge, about $1,600. He was owned by
a farmer named James Pittman, a "crabid kind of a man," grey-headed,
with a broken leg; drank very hard, at which times he would swear that
he would "sell them all to Georgia;" this threat was always unpleasant
to the ears of James, but it seemed to be a satisfaction to the master.
Fearing that it would be put into execution, James thought he had better
let no time be lost in getting on towards Canada, though he was entitled
to his Freedom at the age of twenty-five. Left his father, four brothers
and two sisters. Also left his wife, to whom he had been married the
previous Christmas.

His master's further stock of slaves consisted of two women, a young man
and a child. The name of his old mistress was Amelia. She was "right
nice," James admitted. One of James' brothers had been sold to Georgia
by Pittman, although he was also entitled to his Freedom at the age of
twenty-five.

His near relatives left in bondage lived near Level Square, Queen Ann's
county, Maryland. His wife's name was Henrietta. "She was free."

Interesting letter from James Massey to his wife. It was forwarded to
the corresponding secretary, to be sent to her, but no opportunity was
afforded so to do, safely.


    ST. CATHARINES, C.W., April 24, 1857.

    no meet on Earth I hope that we shall meet in heven.

    Your husbern.

    Good night.

    JAME MASEY.


Perry was about thirty-one years of age, round-made, of dark complexion,
and looked quite gratified with his expedition, and the prospect of
becoming a British subject instead of a Maryland slave. He was not free,
however, from the sad thought of having left his wife and three children
in the "_prison house_," nor of the fact that his own dear mother was
brutally stabbed to the heart with a butcher knife by her young master,
while he (Perry) was a babe; nor of a more recent tragedy by which a
fellow-servant, only a short while before he fled, was also murdered by
a stab in the groin from another young master. "Powerful bad" treatment,
and "no pay," was the only reward poor Perry had ever received for his
life services. Perry could only remember his having received from his
master, in all, eleven cents. Left a brother and sister in Slavery.
Perry was worth $1200 perhaps.

Perry was compelled to leave his wife and three children--namely, Hannah
(wife), Perry Henry, William Thomas and Alexander, who were owned by
John McGuire, of Caroline county, Maryland. Perry was a fellow-servant
of James Massey, and was held by the same owner who held James. It is
but just, to say, that it was not in the Pittman family that his mother
and his fellow-servant had been so barbarously murdered. These
occurrences took place before they came into the hands of Pittman.

The provocation for which his fellow-servant was killed, was said to be
very trifling. In a moment of rage, his young master, John Piper,
plunged the blade of a small knife into Perry's groin, which resulted in
his death twenty-six hours afterwards. For one day only the young master
kept himself concealed, then he came forward and said he "did it in
self-defense," and there the matter ended. The half will never be told
of the barbarism of Slavery.

Perry's letter subjoined, explains where he went, and how his mind was
occupied with thoughts of his wife, children and friends.


    ST. CATHARINES, C.W. June 21, 1857.

George Rhoads is a young man of twenty-five years of age, chestnut
color, face round, and hating Slavery heartily. He had come from under
the control of John P. Dellum a farmer, and a crabbed master, who "would
swear very much when crossed, and would drink moderately every day,"
except sometimes he would "take a _spree_," and would then get pretty
high. Withal he was a member of the Presbyterian church at Perryville,
Maryland; he was a single man and followed farming. Within the last two
or three years, he had sold a man and woman; hence, George thought it
was time to take warning. Accordingly he felt it to be his duty to try
for Canada, via Underground Rail Road. As his master had always declared
that if one run off, he would sell the rest to Georgia, George very
wisely concluded that as an effort would have to be made, they had
better leave their master with as "few as possible to be troubled with
selling." Consequently, a consultation was had between the brothers,
which resulted in the exit of a party of eight. The market price for
George would be about $1400. A horrid example professed Christians set
before the world, while holding slaves and upholding Slavery.

James Rhoads, brother of George, was twenty-three years of age, medium
size, dark color, intelligent and manly, and would doubtless have
brought, in the Richmond market, $1700. Fortunately he brought his wife
and child with him. James was also held by the same task-master who held
George. Often had he been visited with severe stripes, and had borne his
full share of suffering from his master.

George Washington, one of the same party, was only about fifteen years
of age; he was tall enough, however, to pass for a young man of twenty.
George was of an excellent, fast, dark color. Of course, mentally he was
undeveloped, nevertheless, possessed of enough mother-wit to make good
his escape. In the slave market he might have been valued at $800.
George was claimed as the lawful property of Benjamin Sylves--a
Presbyterian, who owned besides, two men, three girls, and a boy. He was
"tolerable good" sometimes, and sometimes "bad." Some of the slaves
supposed themselves to be on the eve of being emancipated about the time
George left; but of this there was no certainty. George, however, was
not among this hopeful number, consequently, he thought that he would
start in time, and would be ready to shout for Freedom quite as soon as
any other of his fellow-bondmen. George left a father and three sisters.
Sarah Elizabeth Rhoads, wife of James Rhoads, was seventeen years of
age, a tall, dark, young woman, who had had no chances for mental
improvement, except such as were usual on a farm, stocked with slaves,
where learning to read the Bible was against the "rules." Sarah was a
young slave mother with a babe (of course a slave) only eight months
old. She was regarded as having been exceedingly fortunate in having
rescued herself and child from the horrid fate of slaves.

MARY ELIZABETH STEPHENSON is a promising-looking young woman, of twenty
years of age, chestnut color, and well made. Hard treatment had been her
lot. Left her mother, two sisters and four brothers in bondage. Worth
$1100.

Although these travelers were of the "field hand" class, who had never
been permitted to see much off of the farm, and had been deprived of
hearing intelligent people talk, yet the spirit of Freedom, so natural
to man, was quite uppermost with all of them. The members of the
Committee who saw them, were abundantly satisfied that these candidates
for Canada would prove that they were able to "take care of themselves."

Their wants were attended to in the usual manner, and they were sent on
their way rejoicing, the Committee feeling quite a deep interest in
them. It looked like business to see so many passing over the Road.

CHARLES THOMPSON,


CARRIER OF "THE NATIONAL AMERICAN," OFF FOR CANADA.


The subjoined "pass" was brought to the Underground Rail Road station in
Philadelphia by Charles, and while it was interesting as throwing light
upon his escape, it is important also as a specimen of the way the
"pass" system was carried on in the dark days of Slavery in Virginia:


    "NAT. AMERICAN OFFICE,

    Richmond, July 20th, 1857.

    Permit Charles to pass and repass from this office to the
    residence of Rev B. Manly's on Clay St., near 11th, at any hour
    of the night for one month.

    WM. W. HARDWICK."


It is a very short document, but it used to be very unsafe for a slave
in Richmond, or any other Southern city, to be found out in the evening
without a legal paper of this description. The penalties for being found
unprepared to face the police were fines, imprisonment and floggings.
The satisfaction it seemed always to afford these guardians of the city
to find either males or females trespassing in this particular, was
unmistakable. It gave them (the police) the opportunity to prove to
those they served (slaveholders), that they were the right men in the
right place, guarding their interests. Then again they got the fine for
pocket money, and likewise the still greater pleasure of administering
the flogging. Who would want an office, if no opportunity should turn up
whereby proof could be adduced of adequate qualifications to meet
emergencies? But Charles was too wide awake to be caught without his
pass day or night. Consequently he hung on to it, even after starting on
his voyage to Canada. He, however, willingly surrendered it to a member
of the Committee at his special request.

But in every way Charles was quite a remarkable man. It afforded the
Committee great pleasure to make his acquaintance, and much practical
and useful information was gathered from his story, which was felt to be
truthful.

The Committee feeling assured that this "chattel" must have been the
subject of much inquiry and anxiety from the nature of his former
position, as a prominent piece of property, as a member of the Baptist
church, as taking "first premiums" in making tobacco, and as a paper
carrier in the National American office, felt called upon to note fully
his movements before and after leaving Richmond.

In stature he was medium size, color quite dark, hair long and
bushy--rather of a raw-boned and rugged appearance, modest and
self-possessed; with much more intelligence than would be supposed from
first observation. On his arrival, ere he had "shaken hands with the
(British) Lion's paw," (which he was desirous of doing), or changed the
habiliments in which he escaped, having listened to the recital of his
thrilling tale, and wishing to get it word for word as it flowed
naturally from his brave lips, at a late hour of the night a member of
the Committee remarked to him, with pencil in hand, that he wanted to
take down some account of his life. "Now," said he, "we shall have to be
brief. Please answer as correctly as you can the following questions:"
"How old are you?" "Thirty-two years old the 1st day of last June."
"Were you born a slave?" "Yes." "How have you been treated?" "Badly all
the time for the last twelve years." "What do you mean by being treated
badly?" "Have been whipped, and they never give me anything; some people
give their servants at Christmas a dollar and a half and two dollars,
and some five, but my master would never give me anything." "What was
the name of your master?" "Fleming Bibbs." "Where did he live?" "In
Caroline county, fifty miles above Richmond." "What did he do?" "He was
a farmer." "Did you ever live with him?" "Never did; always hired me
out, and then I couldn't please him." "What kind of a man was he?" "A
man with a very severe temper; would drink at all times, though would do
it slyly." "Was he a member of any church?" "Baptist church--would curse
at his servants as if he wern't in any church." "Were his family members
of church, too?" "Yes." "What kind of family had he?" "His wife was a
tolerable fair woman, but his sons were dissipated, all of them
_rowdies_ and _gamblers. His sons has had children by the servants. One
of his daughters had a child by his grandson last April_. They are
traders, buy and sell."

"How many slaves did he own?" "Sam, Richmond, Henry, Dennis, Jesse,
Addison, Hilliard, Jenny, Lucius, Julia, Charlotte, Easte, Joe, Taylor,
Louisa, two more small children and Jim." Did any of them know that you
were going to leave? "No, I saw my brother Tuesday, but never told him a
word about it." "What put it into your head to leave?" "It was bad
treatment; for being put in jail for sale the 7th of last January; was
whipped in jail and after I came out the only thing they told me was
that I had been selling newspapers about the streets, and was half
free."

"Where did you live then?" "In Richmond, Va.; for twenty-two years I
have been living out." "How much did your master receive a year for your
hire?" "From sixty-five to one hundred and fifty dollars." "Did you have
to find yourself?" "The people who hired me found me. The general rule
is in Richmond, for a week's board, seventy-five cents is allowed; if he
gets any more than that he has got to find it himself." "How about
Sunday clothing?" "Find them yourself?" "How about a house to live in?"
"Have that to find yourself." "Suppose you have a wife and family." "It
makes no difference, they don't allow you anything for that at all."
"Suppose you are sick who pays your doctor's bill?" "He (master) pays
that." "How do you manage to make a little extra money?" "By getting up
before day and carrying out papers and doing other jobs, cleaning up
single men's rooms and the like of that." "What have you been employed
at in Richmond?" "Been working in tobacco factory in general; this year
I was hired at a printing-office. The National American. I carried
papers." "Had you a wife?" "I did, but her master was a very bad man and
was opposed to me, and was against my coming to his place to see my
wife, and he persuaded her to take another husband in preference to me;
being in his hands she took his advice." "How long ago was that?" "Very
near twelve months; she got married last fall." "Had you any children?"
"Yes." "How many?" "Five." "Where are they?" "Three are with Joel Luck,
her master, one with his sister Eliza, and the other belongs to Judge
Hudgins, of Bowling Green Court House." "Do you ever expect to see them
again?" "No, not till the day of the Great I am!" "Did you ever have any
chance of schooling?" "Not a day in my life." "Can you read?" "No, sir,
nor write my own name." "What do you think of Slavery any how?" "I think
it's a great curse, and I think the _Baptists_ in _Richmond_ will go to
the deepest hell, if there is any, for they are so wicked they will work
you all day and part of the night, and _wear cloaks and long faces_, and
try to get all the work out of you they can by telling you about Jesus
Christ. All the extra money you make they think you will give to hear
talk about Jesus Christ. Out of their extra money they have to pay a
white man _Five hundred dollars a year for preaching_." "What kind of
preaching does he give them?" "He tells them if they die in their sins
they will go to hell; don't tell them any thing about their elevation;
he would tell them obey their masters and mistresses, for good servants
make good masters." "Did you belong to the Baptist Church?" "Yes, Second
Baptist Church." "Did you feel that the preaching you heard was the true
Gospel?" "One part of it, and one part burnt me as bad as ever insult
did. They would tell us that we must take money out of our pockets to
send it to Africa, to enlighten the African race. I think that we were
about as blind in Richmond as the African race is in Africa. All they
want you to know, is to have sense enough to say master and mistress,
and _run_ like lightning, when they speak to you, to do exactly what
they want you to do," "When you made up your mind to escape, where did
you think you would go to?" "I made up my mind not to stop short of the
British protection; to shake hands with the _Lion's_ paw." "Were you not
afraid of being captured on the way, of being devoured by the
abolitionists, or of freezing and starving in Canada?" "Well, I had
often thought that I would be in a bad condition to come here, without
money and clothes, but I made up my mind to come, live or die." "What
are your impressions from what little you have seen of Freedom?" "I
think it is intended for all men, and all men ought to have it."
"Suppose your master was to appear before you, and offer you the
privilege of returning to Slavery or death on the spot, which would be
your choice?" "_Die right there_. I made up my mind before I started."
"Do you think that many of the slaves are anxious about their Freedom?"
"The third part of them ain't anxious about it, because the white people
have _blinded_ them, telling about the North,--they _can't live here_;
telling them that the people are worse off than they are there; they say
that the 'niggers' in the North have no houses to live in, stand about
freezing, dirty, no clothes to wear. They all would be very glad to get
their time, but want to stay where they are." Just at this point of the
interview, the hour of midnight admonished us that it was time to
retire. Accordingly, said Mr. Thompson, "I guess we had better close,"
adding, if he "could only write, he could give seven volumes!" Also,
said he, "give my best respects to Mr. W.W. Hardwicke, and Mr. Perry in
the National American office, and tell them _I wish they will pay the
two boys who carry the papers for me, for they are as ignorant of this
matter as you are_."

Charles was duly forwarded to Canada to shake hands with the Lion's paw,
and from the accounts which came from him to the Committee, he was
highly delighted. The following letter from him afforded gratifying
evidence, that he neither forgot his God nor his friends in freedom:


    DETROIT, Sept. 17, 1862.

    DEAR BROTHER IN CHRIST--It affords me the greatest pleasure
    imaginable in the time I shall occupy in penning these few lines
    to you and your dear loving wife, not because I can write them
    to you myself, but for the love and regard I have for you, for I
    never can forget a man who will show kindness to his neighbor
    when in distress. I remember when I was in distress and out of
    doors, you took me in; I was hungry, and you fed me; for these
    things God will reward you, dear brother. I am getting along as
    well as I can expect. Since I have been out here, I have
    endeavored to make every day tell for itself, and I can say, no
    doubt, what a great many men cannot say, that I have made good
    use of all the time that God has given me, and not one week has
    been spent in idleness. Brother William, I expect to visit you
    some time next summer to sit and have a talk with you and Mrs.
    Still. I hope to see that time, if it is God's will. You will
    remember me, with my wife, to Mrs. Still. Give my best respects
    to all inquiring friends, and believe me to be yours forever.
    Well wishes both soul and body. Please write to me sometimes.

    C.W. THOMPSON.

BLOOD FLOWED FREELY.


ABRAM GALLOWAY AND RICHARD EDEN, TWO PASSENGERS SECRETED IN A VESSEL
LOADED WITH SPIRITS OF TURPENTINE. SHROUDS PREPARED TO PREVENT BEING
SMOKED TO DEATH.


The Philadelphia branch of the Underground Rail Road was not fortunate
in having very frequent arrivals from North Carolina. Of course such of
her slave population as managed to become initiated in the mysteries of
traveling North by the Underground Rail Road were sensible enough to
find out nearer and safer routes than through Pennsylvania. Nevertheless
the Vigilance Committee of Philadelphia occasionally had the pleasure of
receiving some heroes who were worthy to be classed among the bravest of
the brave, no matter who they may be who have claims to this
distinction.

In proof of this bold assertion the two individuals whose names stand at
the beginning of this chapter are presented. Abram was only twenty-one
years of age, mulatto, five feet six inches high, intelligent and the
picture of good health. "What was your master's name?" inquired a member
of the Committee. "Milton Hawkins," answered Abram. "What business did
Milton Hawkins follow?" again queried said member. "He was chief
engineer on the Wilmington and Manchester Rail Road" (not a branch of
the Underground Rail Road), responded Richard. "Describe him," said the
member. "He was a slim built, tall man with whiskers. He was a man of
very good disposition. I always belonged to him; he owned three. He
always said he would sell before he would use a whip. His wife was a
very mean woman; she would whip contrary to his orders." "Who was your
father?" was further inquired. "John Wesley Galloway," was the prompt
response. "Describe your father?" "He was captain of a government
vessel; he recognized me as his son, and protected me as far as he was
allowed so to do; he lived at Smithfield, North Carolina. Abram's
master, Milton Hawkins, lived at Wilmington, N.C." "What prompted you to
escape?" was next asked. "Because times were hard and I could not come
up with my wages as I was required to do, so I thought I would try and
do better." At this juncture Abram explained substantially in what sense
times were hard, &c. In the first place he was not allowed to own
himself; he, however, preferred hiring his time to serving in the usual
way. This favor was granted Abram; but he was compelled to pay $15 per
month for his time, besides finding himself in clothing, food, paying
doctor bills, and a head tax of $15 a year.

[Illustration: HON. ABRAM GALLOWAY]

Even under this master, who was a man of very good disposition, Abram
was not contented. In the second place, he "always thought Slavery was
wrong," although he had "never suffered any personal abuse." Toiling
month after month the year round to support his master and not himself,
was the one intolerable thought. Abram and Richard were intimate
friends, and lived near each other. Being similarly situated, they could
venture to communicate the secret feelings of their hearts to each
other. Richard was four years older than Abram, with not quite so much
Anglo-Saxon blood in his veins, but was equally as intelligent, and was
by trade, a "fashionable barber," well-known to the ladies and gentlemen
of Wilmington. Richard owed service to Mrs. Mary Loren, a widow. "She
was very kind and tender to all her slaves." "If I was sick," said
Richard, "she would treat me the same as a mother would." She was the
owner of twenty, men, women and children, who were all hired out, except
the children too young for hire. Besides having his food, clothing and
doctor's expenses to meet, he had to pay the "very kind and
tender-hearted widow" $12.50 per month, and head tax to the State,
amounting to twenty-five cents per month. It so happened, that Richard
at this time, was involved in a matrimonial difficulty. Contrary to the
laws of North Carolina, he had lately married a free girl, which was an
indictable offence, and for which the penalty was then in soak for
him--said penalty to consist of thirty-nine lashes, and imprisonment at
the discretion of the judge.

So Abram and Richard put their heads together, and resolved to try the
Underground Rail Road. They concluded that liberty was worth dying for,
and that it was their duty to strike for Freedom even if it should cost
them their lives. The next thing needed, was information about the
Underground Rail Road. Before a great while the captain of a schooner
turned up, from Wilmington, Delaware. Learning that his voyage extended
to Philadelphia, they sought to find out whether this captain was true
to Freedom. To ascertain this fact required no little address. It had to
be done in such a way, that even the captain would not really understand
what they were up to, should he be found untrue. In this instance,
however, he was the right man in the right place, and very well
understood his business.

Abram and Richard made arrangements with him to bring them away; they
learned when the vessel would start, and that she was loaded with tar,
rosin, and spirits of turpentine, amongst which the captain was to
secrete them. But here came the difficulty. In order that slaves might
not be secreted in vessels, the slave-holders of North Carolina had
procured the enactment of a law requiring all vessels coming North to be
smoked.

To escape this dilemma, the inventive genius of Abram and Richard soon
devised a safe-guard against the smoke. This safe-guard consisted in
silk oil cloth shrouds, made large, with drawing strings, which, when
pulled over their heads, might be drawn very tightly around their
waists, whilst the process of smoking might be in operation. A bladder
of water and towels were provided, the latter to be wet and held to
their nostrils, should there be need. In this manner they had determined
to struggle against death for liberty. The hour approached for being at
the wharf. At the appointed time they were on hand ready to go on the
boat; the captain secreted them, according to agreement. They were ready
to run the risk of being smoked to death; but as good luck would have
it, the law was not carried into effect in this instance, so that the
"smell of smoke was not upon them." The effect of the turpentine,
however, of the nature of which they were totally ignorant, was worse,
if possible, than the smoke would have been. The blood was literally
drawn from them at every pore in frightful quantities. But as heroes of
the bravest type they resolved to continue steadfast as long as a pulse
continued to beat, and thus they finally conquered.

The invigorating northern air and the kind treatment of the Vigilance
Committee acted like a charm upon them, and they improved very rapidly
from their exhaustive and heavy loss of blood. Desiring to retain some
memorial of them, a member of the Committee begged one of their silk
shrouds, and likewise procured an artist to take the photograph of one
of them; which keepsakes have been valued very highly. In the regular
order of arrangements the wants of Abram and Richard were duly met by
the Committee, financially and otherwise, and they were forwarded to
Canada. After their safe arrival in Canada, Richard addressed a member
of the Committee thus:


    KINGSTON, July 20, 1857.

    MR. WILLIAM STILL--_Dear Friend_:--I take the opertunity of
    wrighting a few lines to let you no that we air all in good
    health hoping thos few lines may find you and your family

    Yours with Respect,

    RICHARD EDONS.


Abram, his comrade, allied himself faithfully to John Bull until Uncle
Sam became involved in the contest with the rebels. In this hour of need
Abram hastened back to North Carolina to help fight the battles of
Freedom. How well he acted his part, we are not informed. We only know
that, after the war was over, in the reconstruction of North Carolina,
Abram was promoted to a seat in its Senate. He died in office only a few
months since. The portrait is almost a "fac-simile."

JOHN PETTIFOOT.


Anglo-African and Anglo-Saxon were about equally mixed in the
organization of Mr. Pettifoot. His education, with regard to books, was
quite limited. He had, however, managed to steal the art of reading and
writing, to a certain extent. Notwithstanding the Patriarchal
Institution of the South, he was to all intents and purposes a rebel at
heart, consequently he resolved to take a trip on the Underground Rail
Road to Canada. So, greatly to the surprise of those whom he was
serving, he was one morning inquired for in vain. No one could tell what
had become of Jack no more than if he had vanished like a ghost.
Doubtless Messrs. McHenry and McCulloch were under the impression that
newspapers and money possessed great power and could, under the
circumstances, be used with entire effect. The following advertisement
is evidence, that Jack was much needed at the tobacco factory.


    $100 REWARD--For the apprehension and delivery to us of a
    MULATTO MAN, named John Massenberg, or John Henry Pettifoot, who
    has been passing as free, under the name of Sydney. He is about
    5 feet 6 or 8 inches high, spare made, bright, with a bushy head
    of hair, curled under and a small moustache. Absconded a few
    days ago from our Tobacco Factory.

Jack was aware that a trap of this kind would most likely be set for
him, and that the large quantity of Anglo-Saxon blood in his veins would
not save him. He was aware, too, that he was the reputed son of a white
gentleman, who was a professional dentist, by the name of Dr. Peter
Cards. The Doctor, however, had been called away by death, so Jack could
see no hope or virtue in having a white father, although a "chivalric
gentleman," while living, and a man of high standing amongst
slave-holders. Jack was a member of the Baptist church, too, and hoped
he was a good Christian; but he could look for no favors from the
Church, or sympathy on the score of his being a Christian. He knew very
well were it known, that he had the love of freedom in his heart, or the
idea of the Underground Rail Road in his head, he would be regarded as
having committed the "unpardonable sin." So Jack looked to none of these
"broken reeds" in Richmond in the hour of his trial, but to Him above,
whom he had not seen, and to the Underground Rail Road. He felt pretty
well satisfied, that if Providence would aid him, and he could get a
conductor to put him on the right road to Canada, he would be all right.
Accordingly, he acted up to his best light, and thus he succeeded
admirably, as the sequel shows.

JOHN HENRY PETTIFOOT. John is a likely young man, quite bright in color
and in intellect also. He was the son of Peter Cards, a dentist by
profession, and a white man by complexion. As a general thing, he had
been used 'very well;' had no fault to find, except this year, being
hired to McHenry & McCulloch, tobacconists, of Petersburg, Va., whom he
found rather more oppressive than he agreed for, and supposing that he
had 'no right' to work for any body for nothing, he 'picked up his bed
and walked.' His mistress had told him that he was '_willed_ free,' at
her death, but John was not willing to wait her "motions to die."

He had a wife in Richmond, but was not allowed to visit her. He left one
sister and a step-father in bondage. Mr. Pettifoot reached Philadelphia
by the Richmond line of steamers, stowed away among the pots and cooking
utensils. On reaching the city, he at once surrendered himself into the
hands of the Committee, and was duly looked after by the regular acting
members.

EMANUEL T. WHITE.


EMANUEL was about twenty-five years of age, with seven-eighths of white
blood in his veins, medium size, and a very smart and likely-looking
piece of property generally. He had the good fortune to escape from
Edward H. Hubbert, a ship timber merchant of Norfolk, Va. Under
Hubbert's yoke he had served only five years, having been bought by him
from a certain Aldridge Mandrey, who was described as a "very cruel
man," and would "rather fight than eat." "I have licks that will carry
me to my grave, and will be there till the flesh rots off my bones,"
said Emanuel, adding that his master was a "_devil_," though a member of
the Reformed Methodist Church. But his mistress, he said, was a "right
nice little woman, and kept many licks off me." "If you said you were
sick, he would whip it out of you." From Mandrey he once fled, and was
gone two months, but was captured at Williamsburg, Va., and received a
severe flogging, and carried home. Hubbert finally sold Emanuel to a Mr.
Grigway of Norfolk; with Emanuel Mr. G. was pretty well suited, but his
wife was not--he had "too much white blood in him" for her. Grigway and
his wife were members of the Episcopal Church.

In this unhappy condition Emanuel found a conductor of the Underground
Rail Road. A secret passage was secured for him on one of the Richmond
steamers, and thus he escaped from his servitude. The Committee attended
to his wants, and forwarded him on as usual. From Syracuse, where he was
breathing quite freely under the protection of the Rev. J.W. Loguen, he
wrote the following letter:


    SYRACUSE, July 29, 1857.

    MY DEAR FRIEND, MR. STILL:--I got safe through to Syracuse, and
    found the house of our friend, Mr. J.W. Loguen. Many thanks to
    you for your kindness to me. I wish to say to you, dear sir,
    that I expect my clothes will be sent to Dr. Landa, and I wish,
    if you please, get them and send them to the care of Mr. Loguen,
    at Syracuse, for me He will be in possession of my whereabouts
    and will send them to me. Remember me to Mr. Landa and Miss
    Millen Jespan, and much to you and your family.

    Truly Yours,

THE ESCAPE OF A CHILD FOURTEEN MONTHS OLD.


There is found the following brief memorandum on the Records of the
Underground Rail Road Book, dated July, 1857:

"A little child of fourteen months old was conveyed to its mother, who
had been compelled to flee without it nearly nine months ago."

While the circumstances connected with the coming of this slave child
were deeply interesting, no further particulars than the simple notice
above were at that time recorded. Fortunately, however, letters from the
good friends, who plucked this infant from the jaws of Slavery, have
been preserved to throw light on this little one, and to show how
true-hearted sympathizers with the Slave labored amid dangers and
difficulties to save the helpless bondman from oppression. It will be
observed, that both these friends wrote from Washington, D.C., the seat
of Government, where, if Slavery was not seen in its worst aspects, the
Government in its support of Slavery appeared in a most revolting light.



LETTER FROM "J.B."



    WASHINGTON, D.C., July 12, 1857.

    DEAR SIR:--Some of our citizens, I am told, lately left here for
    Philadelphia, three of whom were arrested and brought back.

    I beg you will inform me whether two others--(I., whose wife is
    in Philadelphia, was one of them), ever reached your city.

    To-morrow morning Mrs. Weems, _with her baby_, will start for
    Philadelphia and see you probably over night.

    Yours Truly,

    J.B.


"J.B." was not only a trusty and capable conductor of the Underground
Rail Road in Washington, but was also a practical lawyer, at the same
time. His lawyer-like letter, in view of the critical nature of the
case, contained but few words, and those few naturally enough were
susceptible of more than one construction.

Doubtless those styled "our citizens,"--"three of whom were arrested and
brought back,"--were causing great anxiety to this correspondent, not
knowing how soon he might find himself implicated in the "running off,"
etc. So, while he felt it to be his duty, to still aid the child, he was
determined, if the enemy intercepted his letter, he should not find much
comfort or information. The cause was safe in such careful hands. The
following letters, bearing on the same case, are also from another good
conductor, who was then living in Washington.



LETTERS FROM E.L. STEVENS.



    WASHINGTON, D.C., July 8,1857.

    MY DEAR SIR:--I write you now to let you know that the children
    of E. are yet well, and that Mrs. Arrah Weems will start with
    one of them for Philadelphia to-morrow or next day. She will be
    with you probably in the day train. She goes for the purpose of
    making an effort to redeem her last child, now in Slavery. The
    whole amount necessary is raised, except about $300. She will
    take her credentials with her, and you can place the most
    implicit reliance on her statements. The story in regard to the
    Weems' family was published in Frederick Douglass' paper two
    years ago. Since then the two middle boys have been redeemed and
    there is only one left in Slavery, and he is in Alabama. The
    master has agreed to take for him just what he gave, $1100. Mr.
    Lewis Tappan has his letter and the money, except the amount
    specified. There were about $5000 raised in England to redeem
    this family, and they are now all free except this one. And
    there never was a more excellent and worthy family than the
    Weems' family. I do hope, that Mrs. W. will find friends who can
    advance the amount required.

    Truly Yours,

    E.L. STEVENS.





    WASHINGTON, D.C., July 13th, 1857.

    MY FRIEND:--Your kind letter in reply to mine about Arrah was
    duly received. As she is doubtless with you before this, she
    will explain all. I propose that a second journey be made by her
    or some one else, in order to take the other. They have been a
    great burden to the good folks here and should have been _at
    home_ long ere this. Arrah will explain everything. I want,
    however, to say a word in her behalf. If there is a person in
    the world, that deserves the hearty co-operation of every friend
    of humanity, that person is Arrah Weems, who now, after a long
    series of self-sacrificing labor to aid others in their struggle
    for their God-given rights, solicits a small amount to redeem
    the last one of her own children in Slavery. Never have I had my
    sympathies so aroused in behalf of any object as in behalf of
    this most worthy family. She can tell you what I have done. And
    I do hope, that our friends in Philadelphia and New York will
    assist her to make up the full amount required for the purchase
    of the boy.

    After she does what she can in P., will you give her the proper
    direction about getting to New York and to Mr. Tappan's? Inform
    him of what she has done, &c.

    Please write me as soon as you can as to whether she arrived
    safely, &c. Give me your opinion, also, as to the proposal about
    the other. Had you not better keep the little one in P. till the
    other is taken there? Inform me also where E. is, how she is
    getting along, &c., who living with, &c.

    Yours Truly,

    E.L.S.


In this instance, also, as in the case of "J.B.," the care and anxiety
of other souls, besides this child, crying for deliverance, weighed
heavily on the mind of Mr. Stevens, as may be inferred from certain
references in his letters. Mr. Stevens' love of humanity, and impartial
freedom, even in those dark days of Slavery, when it was both unpopular
and unsafe to allow the cries of the bondman to awaken the feeling of
humanity to assist the suffering, was constantly leading him to take
sides with the oppressed, and as he appears in this correspondence, so
it was his wont daily to aid the helpless, who were all around him.
Arrah Weems, who had the care of the child, alluded to so touchingly by
Mr. Stevens, had known, to her heart's sorrow, how intensely painful it
was to a mother's feelings to have her children torn from her by a cruel
master and sold. For Arrah had had a number of children sold, and was at
that very time striving diligently to raise money to redeem the last one
of them. And through such kind-hearted friends as Mr. Stevens, the
peculiar hardships of this interesting family of Weems' were brought to
the knowledge of thousands of philanthropists in this country and
England, and liberal contributions had already been made by friends of
the Slave on both sides of the ocean. It may now be seen, that while
this child had not been a conscious sufferer from the wicked system of
Slavery, it had been the object of very great anxiety and suffering to
several persons, who had individually perilled their own freedom for its
redemption. This child, however, was safely brought to the Vigilance
Committee, in Philadelphia, and was duly forwarded, _viâ_ friends in New
York, to its mother, in Syracuse, where she had stopped to work and wait
for her little one, left behind at the time she escaped.

ESCAPE OF A YOUNG SLAVE MOTHER.


LEFT HER LITTLE BABY-BOY, LITTLE GIRL AND HUSBAND BEHIND.


She anxiously waits their coming in Syracuse, N.Y. Not until after the
foregoing story headed, the "Escape of a Child," etc., had been put into
the hands of the printer and was in type, was the story of the mother
discovered, although it was among the records preserved. Under changed
names, in many instances, it has been found to be no easy matter to cull
from a great variety of letters, records and advertisements, just when
wanted, all the particulars essential to complete many of these
narratives. The case of the child, alluded to above, is a case in point.
Thus, however, while it is impossible to introduce the mother's story in
its proper place, yet, since it has been found, it is too important and
interesting to be left out. It is here given as follows:


    $300 REWARD.--RAN AWAY from the subscriber on Saturday, the 30th
    of August, 1856, my SERVANT WOMAN, named EMELINE CHAPMAN, about
    25 years of age; quite dark, slender built, speaks short, and
    stammers some; with two children, one a female about two and a
    half years old; the other a male, seven or eight months old,
    bright color. I will give the above reward if they are delivered
    to me in Washington.

    MRS. EMILY THOMPSON,

    s23-TU, Th&st&

    Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.


Emeline Chapman, so particularly described in the "Baltimore Sun" of the
23d of September, 1856, arrived by the regular Underground Rail Road
train from Washington. In order to escape the responsibility attached to
her original name, she adopted the name of Susan Bell. Thus for freedom
she was willing to forego her name, her husband, and even her little
children. It was a serious sacrifice; but she had been threatened with
the auction block, and she well understood what that meant. With regard
to usage, having lived away from her owner, Emeline did not complain of
any very hard times. True, she had been kept at work very constantly,
and her owner had very faithfully received all her hire. Emeline had not
even been allowed enough of her hire to find herself in clothing, or
anything for the support of her two children--for these non-essentials,
her kind mistress allowed her to seek elsewhere, as best she could.
Emeline's husband was named John Henry; her little girl she called
Margaret Ann, and her babe she had named after its father, all with the
brand of Slavery upon them. The love of freedom, in the breast of this
spirited young Slave-wife and mother, did not extinguish the love she
bore to her husband and children, however otherwise her course, in
leaving them, as she did, might appear. For it was just this kind of
heroic and self-sacrificing struggle, that appealed to the hearts of men
and compelled attention. The letters of Biglow and Stevens, relative to
the little child, prove this fact, and additional testimony found in the
appended letter from Rev. J.W. Loguen conclusively confirms the same.
Indeed, who could close his eyes and ears to the plaintive cries of such
a mother? Who could refrain from aiding on to freedom children honored
in such a heroic parent?


    SYRACUSE, Oct. 5, 1856.

    DEAR FRIEND STILL:--I write to you for Mrs. Susan Bell, who was
    at your city some time in September last. She is from Washington
    city. She left her dear little children behind (two children).
    She is stopping in our city, and wants to hear from her children
    very much indeed. She wishes to know if you have heard from Mr.
    Biglow, of Washington city. She will remain here until she can
    hear from you. She feels very anxious about her children, I will
    assure you. I should have written before this, but I have been
    from home much of the time since she came to our city. She wants
    to know if Mr. Biglow has heard anything about her husband. If
    you have not written to Mr. Biglow, she wishes you would. She
    sends her love to you and your dear family. She says that you
    were all kind to her, and she does not forget it. You will
    direct your letter to me, dear brother, and I will see that she
    gets it.

    Miss F.E. Watkins left our house yesterday for Ithaca, and other
    places in that part of the State. Frederick Douglass, Wm. J.
    Watkins and others were with us last week; Gerritt Smith with
    others. Miss Watkins is doing great good in our part of the
    State. We think much indeed of her. She is such a good and
    glorious speaker, that we are all charmed with her. We have had
    thirty-one fugitives in the last twenty-seven days; but you, no
    doubt, have had many more than that. I hope the good Lord may
    bless you and spare you long to do good to the hunted and
    outraged among our brethren.

    Yours truly,

    J.W. LOGUEN,

    Agent of the Underground Rail Road.

SAMUEL W. JOHNSON.


ARRIVAL FROM THE "DAILY DISPATCH" OFFICE.


"Sam" was doing Slave labor at the office of the Richmond "Daily
Dispatch," as a carrier of that thoroughly pro-slavery sheet. "Sam" had
possessed himself somehow of a knowledge of reading and writing a
little, and for the news of the day he had quite an itching ear. Also
with regard to his freedom he was quite solicitous. Being of an
ambitious turn of mind, he hired his time, for which he paid his master
$175 per annum in regular quarterly payments. Besides paying this
amount, he had to find himself in board, clothing, and pay doctor's
expenses. He had had more than one owner in his life. The last one,
however, he spoke of thus: "His name is James B. Foster, of Richmond, a
very hard man. He owns three more Slaves besides myself." In escaping,
"Sam" was obliged to leave his wife, who was owned by Christian Bourdon.
His attachment to her, judging from his frequent warm expressions of
affection, was very strong. But, as strong as it was, he felt that he
could not consent to remain in slavery any longer. "Sam" had luckily
come across a copy of Uncle Tom's Cabin, and in perusing it, all his
notions with regard to "Masters and Servants," soon underwent an entire
change, and he began to cast his eyes around him to see how he might get
his freedom. One who was thoroughly awake as he was to the idea of being
free, with a fair share of courage, could now and then meet with the
opportunity to escape by the steamers or schooners coming North. Thus
Samuel found the way open and on one of the steamers came to
Philadelphia. On arriving, he was put at once in the charge of the
Committee. While in their hands he seemed filled with astonishment at
his own achievements, and such spontaneous expressions as naturally
flowed from his heart thrilled and amazed his new found friends, and
abundant satisfaction was afforded, that Samuel Washington Johnson would
do no discredit to his fugitive comrades in Canada. So the Committee
gladly aided him on his journey.

After arriving in Canada, Samuel wrote frequently and intelligently. The
subjoined letter to his wife shows how deeply he was attached to her,
and, at the same time, what his views were of Slavery. The member of the
Committee to whom it was sent with the request, that it should be
forwarded to her, did not meet with the opportunity of doing so. A copy
of it was preserved with other Underground Rail Road documents.



LETTER FROM SAMUEL W. JOHNSON TO HIS WIFE.



    My Dear Wife I now embrace this golden opportunity of writing a
    few Lines to inform you that I am well at present engoying good
    health and hope that these few lines may find you well also. My
    dearest wife I have Left you and now I am in a foreign land
    about fourteen hundred miles from you but though my wife my

    SAMUEL WASHINGTON JOHNSON.


Whether Samuel ever met with the opportunity of communicating with his
wife, the writer cannot say. But of all the trials which Slaves had to
endure, the separations of husbands and wives were the most difficult to
bear up under. Although feeling keenly the loss of his wife, Samuel's
breast swelled with the thought of freedom, as will be seen from the
letter which he wrote immediately after landing in Canada:


    ST. CATHARINE, UPPER CANADA WEST.

    MR. WILLIAM STILL:--I am now in safety. I arrived at home safe
    on the 11th inst at 12 o'clock M. So I hope that you will now
    take it upon yourself to inform me something of that letter I
    left at your house that night when I left there and write me
    word how you are and how is your wife. I wish you may excuse
    this letter for I am so full that I cannot express my mind at
    all. I am only got $1.50 and I feel as if I had an independent
    fortune but I don't want you to think that I am going to be idle
    because I am on free ground and I shall always work though I am
    not got nothing to do at present. Direct your letter to the post
    office as soon as possible.

FAMILY FROM BALTIMORE.


STEPHEN AMOS, _alias_ HENRY JOHNSON, HARRIET, _alias_ MARY JANE JOHNSON
(man and wife), and their four children, ANN REBECCA, WM. H., ELIZABETH
and MARY ELLEN. Doubtless, in the eyes of a Slaveholder, a more
"likely-looking" family could not readily be found in Baltimore, than
the one to be now briefly noticed. The mother and her children were
owned by a young slave-holder, who went by the name of William Giddings,
and resided in Prince George's county, Md. Harriet acknowledged, that
she had been treated "tolerably well in earlier days" for one in her
condition; but, as in so many instances in the experience of Slaves,
latterly, times had changed with her and she was compelled to serve
under a new master who oft-times treated her "very severely." On one
occasion, seven years previously, a brother of her owner for a trifling
offence struck and kicked her so brutally, that she was immediately
thrown into a fit of sickness, which lasted "all one summer"--from this
she finally recovered.

On another occasion, about one year previous to her escape, she was
seized by her owner and thrust into prison to be sold. In this instance
the interference of the Uncle of Harriet's master saved her from the
auction block. The young master, was under age, and at the same time
under the guardianship of his Uncle. The young master had early acquired
an ardent taste for fast horses, gambling, etc. Harriet felt, that her
chances for the future in the hands of such a brutal master could not be
other than miserable. Her husband had formerly been owned by John S.
Giddings, who was said to have been a "mild man." He had allowed Stephen
(her husband) to buy himself, and for eighteen months prior to the
flight, he had been what was called a free man. It should also be
further stated in justice to Stephen's master, that he was so disgusted
with the manner in which Stephen's wife was treated, that he went so far
as to counsel Stephen to escape with his wife and children. Here at
least is one instance where a Maryland slave-holder lends his influence
to the Underground Rail Road cause. The counsel was accepted, and the
family started on their perilous flight. And although they necessarily
had manifest trials and difficulties to discourage and beset them, they
battled bravely with all these odds and reached the Vigilance Committee
safely. Harriet was a bright mulatto, with marked features of character,
and well made, with good address and quite intelligent. She was about
twenty-six years of age. The children also were remarkably fine-looking
little creatures, but too young to know the horrors of Slavery. The
Committee at once relieved them of their heavy load of anxiety by
cheering words and administering to their necessities with regard to
food, money, etc. After the family had somewhat recovered from the
fatigue and travel-worn condition in which they arrived, and were
prepared to resume their journey, the Committee gave them the strictest
caution with regard to avoiding slave-hunters, and also in reference to
such points on the road where they would be most in danger of going
astray from a lack of knowledge of the way. Then, with indescribable
feelings of sympathy, free tickets were tendered them, and they having
been conducted to the depot, were sent on their way rejoicing.

ELIJAH HILTON.


FROM RICHMOND.


After many years of hard toiling for the support of others, the yoke
pressed so heavily upon Elijah's shoulders, that he could not endure
Slave life any longer. In the hope of getting rid of his bondage, by
dexterous management and a resolute mind, which most determined and
thoughtful men exercise when undertaking to accomplish great objects, he
set about contriving to gain his freedom. In proof of Elijah's
truthfulness, the advertisement of Mr. R.J. Christians is here offered,
as taken from a Richmond paper, about the time that Elijah passed
through Philadelphia on the Underground Rail Road, in 1857.


    RAN AWAY--$500 REWARD.--Left the Tobacco Factory of the
    subscriber on the 14th inst., on the pretence of being sick, a
    mulatto man, named ELIJAH, the property of Maj. Edward Johnson,
    of Chesterfield county. He is about 5 feet 8 or 10 inches high,
    spare made, bushy hair, and very genteel appearance; he is
    supposed to be making his way North. The above reward will be
    paid if delivered at my factory.

    jy 21--ts.


From his infancy up to the hour of his escape, not a breath of free air
had he ever been permitted to breathe. He was first owned by Mrs.
Caroline Johnson, "a stingy widow, the owner of about fifty slaves, and
a member of Dr. Plummer's church." Elijah, at her death, was willed to
her son, Major Johnson, who was in the United States service. Elijah
spoke of him as a "favorable man," but added, "I'd rather be free. I
believe I can treat myself better than he can or anybody else." For the
last nineteen years he had been hired out, sometimes as waiter,
sometimes in a tobacco factory, and for five years in the _Coal Mines_.

At the mines he was treated very brutally, but at Cornelius Hall's
Tobacco factory, the suffering he had to endure seems almost incredible.
The poor fellow, with the scars upon his person and the unmistakable
earnestness of his manner, only needed to be seen and heard to satisfy
the most incredulous of the truth of his story. For refusing to be
flogged, one time at Hall's Factory, the overseer, in a rage, "took up a
hickory club" and laid his head "open on each side." Overpowered and
wounded, he was stripped naked and compelled to receive THREE HUNDRED
LASHES, by which he was literally excoriated from head to foot. For six
months afterwards he was "laid up." Last year he was hired out for "one
hundred and eighty dollars," out of which he "received but five
dollars." This year he brought "one hundred and ninety dollars." Up to
the time he escaped, he had received "two dollars," and the promise of
"more at Christmas." Left brothers and sisters, all ignorant of his way
of escape. The following pass brought away by Elijah speaks for itself,
and will doubtless be interesting to some of our readers who are
ignorant of what used to be Republican usages in the "land of the Free."


    RICHMOND, July 3d, 1857.

    Permit the Bearer _Elijah_ to pass to and from my FACTORY, to
    _Frederick Williams, In the Vallie_, for one month, untill 11
    o'clock at night.

As usual, the Vigilance Committee tendered aid to Elijah, and forwarded
him on to Canada, whence he wrote back as follows:


    TORONTO, Canada West, July 28. Dear friend in due respect to
    your humanity and nobility I now take my pen in hand to inform
    you of my health. I am enjoying a reasonable proportion of
    health at this time and hope when these few lines come to hand
    they may find you and family the same dear Sir I am in Toronto
    and are working at my ole branch of business with meny of my
    friends. I want you to send those to toronto to Mr Tueharts on

    from Richmond Va and expect my things to come to you. So when
    they come to you then you will send them to Jesse Tuehart Edward
    St no 43.

    I must close by saying I have no more at present. I still remain
    your brother,

SOLOMON BROWN.


ARRIVED PER CITY OF RICHMOND.


This candidate for Canada managed to secure a private berth on the
steamship City of Richmond. He was thus enabled to leave his old
mistress, Mary A. Ely, in Norfolk, the place of her abode, and the field
of his servitude. Solomon was only twenty-two years of age, rather under
the medium size, dark color, and of much natural ability. He viewed
Slavery as a great hardship, and for a length of time had been watching
for an opportunity to free himself. He had been in the habit of hiring
his time of his mistress, for which he paid ten dollars per month. This
amount failed to satisfy the mistress, as she was inclined to sell him
to North Carolina, where Slave stock, at that time, was commanding high
prices. The idea of North Carolina and a new master made Solomon rather
nervous, and he was thereby prompted to escape. On reaching the
Committee he manifested very high appreciation of the attention paid
him, and after duly resting for a day, he was sent on his way rejoicing.
Seven days after leaving Philadelphia, he wrote back from Canada as
follows:


    ST. CATHARINES, Feb. 20th, 1854.

    MR. STILL--DEAR SIR:--It is with great pleasure that I have to
    inform you, that I have arrived safe in a land of freedom.
    Thanks to kind friends that helped me here. Thank God that I am
    treading on free soil. I expect to go to work to-morrow in a
    steam factory.

    I would like to have you, if it is not too much trouble, see Mr.
    Minhett, the steward on the boat that I came out on, when he
    gets to Norfolk, to go to the place where my clothes are, and
    bring them to you, and you direct them to the care of Rev. Hiram
    Wilson, St. Catharines, Niagara District, Canada West, by
    rail-road via Suspension Bridge. You mentioned if I saw Mr.
    Foreman. I was to deliver a message--he is not here. I saw two
    yesterday in church, from Norfolk, that I had known there. You
    will send my name, James Henry, as you knew me by that name;
    direct my things to James Henry. My love to your wife and
    children.

    Yours Respectfully,

WILLIAM HOGG, ALIAS JOHN SMITH.


TRAVELER FROM MARYLAND.


William fled from Lewis Roberts, who followed farming in Baltimore
county, Md. In speaking of him, William gave him the character of being
a "fierce and rough man," who owned nine head of slaves. Two of
William's sisters were held by Roberts, when he left. His excuse for
running away was, "ill-treatment." In traveling North, he walked to
Columbia (in Pennsylvania), and there took the cars for Philadelphia.
The Committee took charge of him, and having given him the usual aid,
sent him hopefully on his way. After safely reaching Canada, the thought
of his wife in a land of bondage, pressed so deeply upon his mind, that
he was prompted to make an effort to rescue her. The following letter,
written on his behalf by the Rev. H. Wilson, indicates his feelings and
wishes with regard to her:


    ST. CATHARINES, Canada West, 24th July, 1854.

    DEAR FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--Your encouraging letter, to John
    Smith, was duly received by him, and I am requested to write
    again on his behalf. His colored friend in Baltimore county, who
    would favor his designs, is Thomas Cook, whom he wishes you to
    address, Baltimore post-office, care of Mr. Thomas Spicer.

    He has received a letter from Thomas Cook, dated the 6th of
    June, but it was a long time reaching him. He wishes you to say
    to Cook, that he got his letter, and that he would like to have
    him call on his wife and make known to her, that he is in good
    health, doing well here, and would like to have her come on as
    soon as she can.

    As she is a free woman, there will, doubtless, be no difficulty
    in her coming right through. He is working in the neighborhood
    of St. Catharines, but twelve miles from Niagara Falls. You will
    please recollect to address Thomas Cook, in the care of Thomas
    Spicer, Baltimore Post-office. Smith's wife is at, or near the
    place he came from, and, doubtless, Thomas Cook knows all about
    her condition and circumstances. Please write again to John
    Smith, in my care, if you please, and request Thomas Cook to do
    the same.

    Very respectfully yours in the cause of philanthropy.

TWO FEMALE PASSENGERS FEOM MARYLAND.


As the way of travel, _viâ_ the Underground Rail Road, under the most
favorable circumstances, even for the sterner sex, was hard enough to
test the strongest nerves, and to try the faith of the bravest of the
brave, every woman, who won her freedom, by this perilous undertaking,
deserves commemoration. It is, therefore, a pleasure to thus transfer
from the old Record book the names of Ann Johnson and Lavina Woolfley,
who fled from Maryland in 1857. Their lives, however, had not been in
any way very remarkable. Ann was tall, and of a dark chestnut color,
with an intelligent countenance, and about twenty-four years of age. She
had filled various situations as a Slave. Sometimes she was required to
serve in the kitchen, at other times she was required to toil in the
field, with the plow, hoe, and the like. Samuel Harrington, of Cambridge
District, Maryland, was the name of the man for whose benefit Ann
labored during her younger days. She had no hesitation in saying, that
he was a very "ill-natured man;" he however, was a member of the "old
time Methodist Church." In Slave property he had invested only to the
extent of some five or six head. About three years previous to Ann's
escape, one of her brothers fled and went to Canada. This circumstance
so enraged the owner, that he declared he would "sell all" he owned.
Accordingly Ann was soon put on the auction block, and was bought by a
man who went by the name of William Moore. Moore was a married man, who,
with his wife, was addicted to intemperance and carousing. Ann found
that she had simply got "out of the fire into the frying-pan." She was
really at a loss to tell when her lot was the harder, whether under the
"rum drinker," or the old time Methodist. In this state of mind she
decided to leave all and go to Canada, the refuge for the fleeing
bondman. Lavina, Ann's companion, was the wife of James Woolfley. She
and her husband set out together, with six others, and were of the party
of eight who were betrayed into Dover jail, as has already been
described in these pages. After fighting their way out of the jail, they
separated (for prudential reasons). The husband of Lavina, immediately
after the conflict at the jail, passed on to Canada, leaving his wife
under the protection of friends. Since that time several months had
elapsed, but of each other nothing had been known, before she received
information on her arrival at Philadelphia. The Committee was glad to
inform her, that her husband had safely passed on to Canada, and that
she would be aided on also, where they could enjoy freedom in a free
country.

CAPTAIN F. AND THE MAYOR OF NORFOLK.


TWENTY-ONE PASSENGERS SECRETED IN A BOAT. NOVEMBER, 1855.


CAPTAIN F. was certainly no ordinary man. Although he had been living a
sea-faring life for many years, and the marks of this calling were
plainly enough visible in his manners and speech, he was, nevertheless,
unlike the great mass of this class of men, not addicted to intemperance
and profanity. On the contrary, he was a man of thought, and possessed,
in a large measure, those humane traits of character which lead men to
sympathize with suffering humanity wherever met with.

It must be admitted, however, that the first impressions gathered from a
hasty survey of his rough and rugged appearance, his large head, large
mouth, large eyes, and heavy eye-brows, with a natural gift at keeping
concealed the inner-workings of his mind and feelings, were not
calculated to inspire the belief, that he was fitted to be entrusted
with the lives of unprotected females, and helpless children; that he
could take pleasure in risking his own life to rescue them from the hell
of Slavery; that he could deliberately enter the enemy's domain, and
with the faith of a martyr, face the dread slave-holder, with his
Bowie-knives and revolvers--Slave-hunters, and blood-hounds, lynchings,
and penitentiaries, for humanity's sake. But his deeds proved him to be
a true friend of the Slave; whilst his skill, bravery, and success
stamped him as one of the most daring and heroic Captains ever connected
with the Underground Rail Road cause.

At the time he was doing most for humanity in rescuing bondsmen from
Slavery, Slave-laws were actually being the most rigidly executed. To
show mercy, in any sense, to man or woman, who might be caught assisting
a poor Slave to flee from the prison-house, was a matter not to be
thought of in Virginia. This was perfectly well understood by Captain
F.; indeed he did not hesitate to say, that his hazardous operations
might any day result in the "sacrifice" of his life. But on this point
he seemed to give himself no more concern than he would have done to
know which way the wind would blow the next day. He had his own
convictions about dying and the future, and he declared, that he had "no
fear of death," however it might come. Still, he was not disposed to be
reckless or needlessly to imperil his life, or the lives of those he
undertook to aid. Nor was he averse to receiving compensation for his
services. In Richmond, Norfolk, Petersburg, and other places where he
traded, many slaves were fully awake to their condition. The great slave
sales were the agencies that served to awaken a large number. Then the
various mechanical trades were necessarily given to the Slaves, for the
master had no taste for "greasy, northern mechanics." Then, again, the
stores had to be supplied with porters, draymen, etc., from the slave
population. In the hearts of many of the more intelligent amongst the
slaves, the men, as mechanics, etc., the women, as dress-makers,
chamber-maids, etc., notwithstanding all the opposition and hard laws,
the spirit of Freedom was steadily burning. Many of the slaves were half
brothers, and sisters, cousins, nephews, and nieces to their owners, and
of course "blood would tell."

It was only necessary for the fact to be made known to a single reliable
and intelligent slave, that a man with a boat running North had the love
of Freedom for all mankind in his bosom to make that man an object of
the greatest interest. If an angel had appeared amongst them doubtless
his presence would not have inspired greater anxiety and hope than did
the presence of Captain F. The class most anxious to obtain freedom
could generally manage to acquire some means which they would willingly
offer to captains or conductors in the South for such assistance as was
indispensable to their escape. Many of the slaves learned if they could
manage to cross Mason and Dixon's line, even though they might be
utterly destitute and penniless, that they would then receive aid and
protection from the Vigilance Committee. Here it may be well to state
that, whilst the Committee gladly received and aided all who might come
or be brought to them, they never employed agents or captains to go into
the South with a view of enticing or running off slaves. So when
captains operated, they did so with the full understanding that they
alone were responsible for any failures attending their movements.

The way is now clear to present Captain F. with his schooner lying at
the wharf in Norfolk, loading with wheat, and at the same time with
twenty-one fugitives secreted therein. While the boat was thus lying at
her mooring, the rumor was flying all over town that a number of slaves
had escaped, which created a general excitement a degree less, perhaps,
than if the citizens had been visited by an earthquake. The mayor of the
city with a posse of officers with axes and long spears repaired to
Captain F.'s boat. The fearless commander received his Honor very
coolly, and as gracefully as the circumstances would admit. The mayor
gave him to understand who he was, and by what authority he appeared on
the boat, and what he meant to do. "Very well," replied Captain F.,
"here I am and this is my boat, go ahead and search." His Honor with his
deputies looked quickly around, and then an order went forth from the
mayor to "spear the wheat thoroughly." The deputies obeyed the command
with alacrity. But the spears brought neither blood nor groans, and the
sagacious mayor obviously concluded that he was "barking up the wrong
tree." But the mayor was not there for nothing. "Take the axes and go to
work," was the next order; and the axe was used with terrible effect by
one of the deputies. The deck and other parts of the boat were chopped
and split; no greater judgment being exercised when using the axe than
when spearing the wheat; Captain F. all the while wearing an air of
utter indifference or rather of entire composure. Indeed every step they
took proved conclusively that they were wholly ignorant with regard to
boat searching. At this point, with remarkable shrewdness, Captain F.
saw wherein he could still further confuse them by a bold strategical
move. As though about out of patience with the mayor's blunders, the
captain instantly reminded his Honor that he had "stood still long
enough" while his boat was being "damaged, chopped up," &c. "Now if you
want to search," continued he, "give me the axe, and then point out the
spot you want opened and I will open it for you very quick." While
uttering these words he presented, as he was capable of doing, an
indignant and defiant countenance, and intimated that it mattered not
where or when a man died provided he was in the right, and as though he
wished to give particularly strong emphasis to what he was saying, he
raised the axe, and brought it down edge foremost on the deck with
startling effect, at the same time causing the splinters to fly from the
boards. The mayor and his posse seemed, if not dreadfully frightened,
completely confounded, and by the time Captain F. had again brought down
his axe with increased power, demanding where they would have him open,
they looked as though it was time for them to retire, and in a few
minutes after they actually gave up the search and left the boat without
finding a soul. Daniel in the lions' den was not safer than were the
twenty-one passengers secreted on Captain F.'s boat. The law had been
carried out with a vengeance, but did not avail with this skilled
captain. The "five dollars" were paid for being searched, the amount
which was lawfully required of every captain sailing from Virginia. And
the captain steered direct for the City of Brotherly Love. The wind of
heaven favoring the good cause, he arrived safely in due time, and
delivered his precious freight in the vicinity of Philadelphia within
the reach of the Vigilance Committee. The names of the passengers were
as follows:

[Illustration: Mayor and Police of Norfolk on Capt. Fountain's
schooner.]

ALAN TATUM, DANIEL CARR, MICHAEL VAUGHN, THOMAS NIXON, FREDERICK NIXON,
PETER PETTY, NATHANIEL GARDENER, JOHN BROWN, THOMAS FREEMAN, JAMES
FOSTER, GODFREY SCOTT, WILLIS WILSON, NANCY LITTLE, JOHN SMITH, FRANCIS
HAINES, DAVID JOHNSON, PHILLIS GAULT, ALICE JONES, NED WILSON, and SARAH
C. WILSON, and one other, who subsequently passed on, having been
detained on account of sickness. These passengers were most
"likely-looking articles;" a number of them, doubtless, would have
commanded the very highest prices in the Richmond market. Among them
were some good mechanics--one excellent dress-maker, some "prime"
waiters and chambermaids;--men and women with brains, some of them
evincing remarkable intelligence and decided bravery, just the kind of
passengers that gave the greatest satisfaction to the Vigilance
Committee. The interview with these passengers was extremely
interesting. Each one gave his or her experience of Slavery, the escape,
etc., in his or her own way, deeply impressing those who had the
privilege of seeing and hearing them, with the fact of the growing
spirit of Liberty, and the wonderful perception and intelligence
possessed by some of the sons of toil in the South. While all the names
of these passengers were duly entered on the Underground Rail Road
records, the number was too large, and the time they spent with the
attempts to escape were made by Daniel, after being sold to North
Carolina; for this offence, he was on one occasion stripped naked, and
flogged severely. This did not cure him. Prior to his joining Captain
F.'s party, he had fled to the swamps, and dwelt there for three months,
surrounded with wild animals and reptiles, and it was this state of
solitude that he left directly before finding Captain F. Daniel had a
wife in Portsmouth, to whom he succeeded in paying a private visit,
when, to his unspeakable joy, he made the acquaintance of the noble
Captain F., whose big heart was delighted to give him a passage North.
Daniel, after being sold, had been allowed, within the two years, only
one opportunity of visiting his wife; being thus debarred he resolved to
escape. His wife, whose name was Hannah, had three
children--slaves--their names were Sam, Dan, and "baby." The name of the
latter was unknown to him.

MICHAEL VAUGHN. Michael was about thirty-one years of age, with superior
physical proportions, and no lack of common sense. His color was without
paleness--dark and unfading, and his manly appearance was quite
striking. Michael belonged to a lady, whom he described as a "very
disagreeable woman." "For all my life I have belonged to her, but for
the last eight years I have hired my time. I paid my mistress $120 a
year; a part of the time I had to find my board and all my clothing."
This was the direct, and unequivocal testimony that Michael gave of his
slave life, which was the foundation for alleging that his mistress was
a "very disagreeable woman."

Michael left a wife and one child in Slavery; but they were not owned by
his mistress. Before escaping, he felt afraid to lead his companion into
the secret of his contemplated movements, as he felt, that there was no
possible way for him to do anything for her deliverance; on the other
hand, any revelation of the matter might prove too exciting for the poor
soul;--her name was Esther. That he did not lose his affection for her
whom he was obliged to leave so unceremoniously, is shown by the
appended letter:


    NEW BEDFORD, August 22d, 1855.

    DEAR SIR:--I send you this to inform you that I expect my wife
    to come that way. If she should, you will direct her to me. When
    I came through your city last Fall, you took my name in your
    office, which was then given you, Michael Vaughn; since then my
    name is William Brown, No. 130 Kempton street. Please give my
    wife and child's name to Dr. Lundy, and tell him to attend to it
    for me. Her name is Esther, and the child's name Louisa.

    Truly yours,

    WILLIAM BROWN.


Michael worked in a foundry. In church fellowship he was connected with
the Methodists--his mistress with the Baptists.

THOMAS NIXON was about nineteen years of age, of a dark hue, and quite
intelligent. He had not much excuse to make for leaving, except, that he
was "tired of staying" with his "owner," as he "feared he might be sold
some day," so he "thought" that he might as well save him the trouble.
Thomas belonged to a Mr. Bockover, a wholesale grocer, No. 12 Brewer
street. Thomas left behind him his mother and three brothers. His father
was sold away when he was an infant, consequently he never saw him.
Thomas was a member of the Methodist Church; his master was of the same
persuasion.

FREDERICK NIXON was about thirty-three years of age, and belonged truly
to the wide-awake class of slaves, as his marked physical and mental
appearance indicated. He had a more urgent excuse for escaping than
Thomas; he declared that he fled because, his owner wanted "to work him
hard without allowing him any chance, and had treated him rough."
Frederick was also one of Mr. Bockover's chattels; he left his wife,
Elizabeth, with four children in bondage. They were living in Eatontown,
North Carolina. It had been almost one year since he had seen them. Had
he remained in Norfolk he had not the slightest prospect of being
reunited to his wife and children, as he had been already separated from
them for about three years. This painful state of affairs only increased
his desire to leave those who were brutal enough to make such havoc in
his domestic relations.

PETER PETTY was about twenty-four years of age, and wore a happy
countenance; he was a person of agreeable manners, and withal pretty
smart. He acknowledged, that he had been owned by Joseph Boukley, Hair
Inspector. Peter did not give Mr. Boukley a very good character,
however; he said, that Mr. B. was "rowdyish in his habits, was deceitful
and sly, and would sell his slaves any time. Hard bondage--something
like the children of Israel," was his simple excuse for fleeing. He
hired his time of his master, for which he was compelled to pay $156 a
year. When he lost time by sickness or rainy weather, he was required to
make up the deficiency, also find his clothing. He left a
wife--Lavinia--and one child, Eliza, both slaves. Peter communicated to
his wife his secret intention to leave, and she acquiesced in his going.
He left his parents also. All his sisters and brothers had been sold.
Peter would have been sold too, but his owner was under the impression,
that he was "too good a Christian" to violate the laws by running away.
Peter's master was quite a devoted Methodist, and was attached to the
same Church with Peter. While on the subject of religion, Peter was
asked about the kind and character of preaching that he had been
accustomed to hear; whereupon he gave the following graphic specimen:
"Servants obey your masters; good servants make good masters;  when your
mistress speaks to you don't pout out your mouths; when you want to go
to church ask your mistress and master," etc., etc. Peter declared, that
he had never heard but one preacher speak against slavery, and that "one
was obliged to leave suddenly for the North." He said, that a Quaker
lady spoke in meeting against Slavery one day, which resulted in an
outbreak, and final breaking up of the meeting.

PHILLIS GAULT. Phillis was a widow, about thirty years of age; the blood
of two races flowed in about equal proportions through her veins. Such
was her personal appearance, refinement, manners, and intelligence, that
had the facts of her slave life been unknown, she would have readily
passed for one who had possessed superior advantages. But the facts in
her history proved, that she had been made to feel very keenly the
horrifying effects of Slavery; not in the field, for she had never
worked there; nor as a common drudge, for she had always been required
to fill higher spheres; she was a dress-maker--but not without fear of
the auction block. This dreaded destiny was the motive which constrained
her to escape with the twenty others; secreted in the hold of a vessel
expressly arranged for bringing away slaves. Death had robbed her of her
husband at the time that the fever raged so fearfully in Norfolk. This
sad event deprived her of the hope she had of being purchased by her
husband, as he had intended. She was haunted by the constant thought of
again being sold, as she had once been, and as she had witnessed the
sale of her sister's four children after the death of their mother.

Phillis was, to use her own striking expression in a state of "great
horror;" she felt, that nothing would relieve her but freedom. After
having fully pondered the prospect of her freedom and the only mode
offered by which she could escape, she consented to endure bravely
whatever of suffering and trial might fall to her lot in the
undertaking--and as was the case with thousands of others, she
succeeded. She remained several days in the family of a member of the
Committee in Philadelphia, favorably impressing all who saw her. As she
had formed a very high opinion of Boston, from having heard it so
thoroughly reviled in Norfolk, she desired to go there. The Committee
made no objections, gave her a free ticket, etc. From that time to the
present, she has ever sustained a good Christian character, and as an
industrious, upright, and intelligent woman, she has been and is highly
respected by all who know her. The following letter is characteristic of
her:


    BOSTON, March 22, 1858.

    MY DEAR SIR--I received your photograph by Mr Cooper and it

ARRIVALS FROM DIFFERENT PLACES.


MATILDA MAHONEY,--DR. J.W. PENNINGTON'S BROTHER AND SONS CAPTURED AND
CARRIED BACK.

While many sympathized with the slave in his chains, and freely wept
over his destiny, or gave money to help buy his freedom, but few could
be found who were willing to take the risk of going into the South, and
standing face to face with Slavery, in order to conduct a panting slave
to freedom. The undertaking was too fearful to think of in most cases.
But there were instances when men and women too, moved by the love of
freedom, would take their lives in their hands, beard the lion in his
den, and nobly rescue the oppressed. Such an instance is found in the
case of Matilda Mahoney, in Baltimore.

The story of Matilda must be very brief, although it is full of
thrilling interest. She was twenty-one years of age in 1854, when she
escaped and came to Philadelphia, a handsome young woman, of a light
complexion, quite refined in her manners, and in short, possessing great
personal attractions. But her situation as a slave was critical, as will
be seen.

Her claimant was Wm. Rigard, of Frederick, Md., who hired her to a Mr.
Reese, in Baltimore; in this situation her duties were general housework
and nursing. With these labors, she was not, however, so much
dissatisfied as she was with other circumstances of a more alarming
nature: her old master was tottering on the verge of the grave, and his
son, a trader in New Orleans. These facts kept Matilda in extreme
anxiety. For two years prior to her escape, the young trader had been
trying to influence his father to let him have her for the Southern
market; but the old man had not consented. Of course the trader knew
quite well, that an "article" of her appearance would command readily a
very high price in the New Orleans market. But Matilda's attractions had
won the heart of a young man in the North, one who had known her in
Baltimore in earlier days, and this lover was willing to make desperate
efforts to rescue her from her perilous situation. Whether or not he had
nerve enough to venture down to Baltimore to accompany his intended away
on the Underground Rail Road, his presence would not have aided in the
case. He had, however, a friend who consented to go to Baltimore on this
desperate mission. The friend was James Jefferson, of Providence, R.I.
With the strategy of a skilled soldier, Mr. Jefferson hurried to the
Monumental City, and almost under the eyes of the slave-holders, and
slave-catchers, despite of pro slavery breastworks, seized his prize and
speeded her away on the Underground Railway, before her owner was made
acquainted with the fact of her intended escape. On Matilda's arrival at
the station in Philadelphia, several other passengers from different
points, happened to come to hand just at that time, and gave great
solicitude and anxiety to the Committee. Among these were a man and his
wife and their four children, (noticed elsewhere), from Maryland.
Likewise an interesting and intelligent young girl who had been almost
miraculously rescued from the prison-house at Norfolk, and in addition
to these, the brother of J.W. Pennington, D.D., with his two sons.

While it was a great gratification to have travelers coming along so
fast, and especially to observe in every countenance, determination,
rare manly and womanly bearing, with remarkable intelligence, it must be
admitted, that the acting committee felt at the same time, a very lively
dread of the slave-hunters, and were on their guard. Arrangements were
made to send the fugitives on by different trains, and in various
directions. Matilda and all the others with the exception of the father
and two sons (relatives of Dr. Pennington) successfully escaped and
reached their longed-for haven in a free land. The Penningtons, however,
although pains had been taken to apprize the Doctor of the good news of
the coming of his kin, whom he had not seen for many, many years, were
captured after being in New York some twenty-four hours. In answer to an
advisory letter from the secretary of the Committee the following from
the Doctor is explicit, relative to his wishes and feelings with regard
to their being sent on to New York.


    29 6th AVENUE, NEW YORK, May 24th, 1854.

    MY DEAR MR. STILL:--Your kind letter of the 22d inst has come to
    hand and I have to thank you for your offices of benevolence to
    my bone and my flesh, I have had the pleasure of doing a little
    for your brother Peter, but I do not think it an offset. My
    burden has been great about these brethren. I hope they have
    started on to me. Many thanks, my good friend.

    Yours Truly.

    J.W.C. PENNINGTON.


This letter only served to intensify the deep interest which had already
been awakened for the safety of all concerned. At the same time also it
made the duty of the Committee clear with regard to forwarding them to
N.Y. Immediately, therefore, the Doctor's brother and sons were
furnished with free tickets and were as carefully cautioned as possible
with regard to slave-hunters, if encountered on the road. In company
with several other Underground Rail Road passengers, under the care of
an intelligent guide, all were sent off in due order, looking quite as
well as the most respectable of their race from any part of the country.
The Committee in New York, with the Doctor, were on the look out of
course; thus without difficulty all arrived safely in the Empire City.

It would seem that the coming of his brother and sons so overpowered the
Doctor that he forgot how imminent their danger was. The meeting and
interview was doubtless very joyous. Few perhaps could realize, even in
imagination, the feelings that filled their hearts, as the Doctor and
his brother reverted to their boyhood, when they were both slaves
together in Maryland; the separation--the escape of the former many
years previous--the contrast, one elevated to the dignity of a Doctor of
Divinity, a scholar and noted clergyman, and as such well known in the
United States, and Great Britain, whilst, at the same time, his brother
and kin were held in chains, compelled to do unrequited labor, to come
and go at the bidding of another. Were not these reflections enough to
incapacitate the Doctor for the time being, for cool thought as to how
he should best guard against the enemy? Indeed, in view of Slavery and
its horrid features, the wonder is, not that more was not done, but that
any thing was done, that the victims were not driven almost out of their
senses. But time rolled on until nearly twenty-four hours had passed,
and while reposing their fatigued and weary limbs in bed, just before
day-break, hyena-like the slave-hunters pounced upon all three of them,
and soon had them hand-cuffed and hurried off to a United States'
Commissioner's office. Armed with the Fugitive Law, and a strong guard
of officers to carry it out, resistance would have been simply useless.
Ere the morning sun arose the sad news was borne by the telegraph wires
to all parts of the country of this awful calamity on the Underground
Rail Road.

Scarcely less painful to the Committee was the news of this accident,
than the news of a disaster, resulting in the loss of several lives, on
the Camden and Amboy Road, would have been to its managers. This was the
first accident that had ever taken place on the road after passengers
had reached the Philadelphia Committee, although, in various instances,
slave-hunters had been within a hair's breadth of their prey.

All that was reported respecting the arrest and return of the Doctor's
kin, so disgraceful to Christianity and civilization, is taken from the
Liberator, as follows:


    THREE FUGITIVE SLAVES ARRESTED IN NEW YORK, AND GIVEN UP TO
    THEIR OWNERS.

    NEW YORK, May 25th.

    About three o'clock this morning, three colored men, father and
    two sons, known as Jake, Bob, and Stephen Pennington, were
    arrested at the instance of David Smith and Jacob Grove, of
    Washington Co., Md., who claimed them as their slaves. They were
    taken before Commissioner Morton, of the United States Court,
    and it was understood that they would be examined at 11 o'clock;
    instead of that, however, the case was heard at once, no persons
    being present, when the claimnants testified that they were the
    owners of said slaves and that they escaped from their service
    at Baltimore, on Sunday last.

    From what we can gather of the proceedings, the fugitives
    acknowledged themselves to be slaves of Smith and Grove. The
    commissioner considering the testimony sufficient, ordered their
    surrender, and they were accordingly given up to their
    claimants, who hurried them off at once, and they are now on
    their way to Baltimore. A telegraph despatch has been sent to
    Philadelphia, as it is understood an attempt will be made to
    rescue the parties, when the cars arrive. There was no
    excitement around the commissioner's office, owing to a
    misunderstanding as to the time of examination. The men were
    traced to this city by the claimants, who made application to
    the United States Court, when officers Horton and De Angeles
    were deputied by the marshal to effect their arrest, and those
    officers, with deputy Marshal Thompson scoured the city, and
    finally found them secreted in a house in Broome St. They were
    brought before Commissioner Morton this morning. No counsel
    appeared for the fugitives. The case being made out, the usual
    affidavits of fear of rescue were made, and the warrants
    thereupon issued, and the three fugitives were delivered over to
    the U.S. Marshal, and hurried off to Maryland. They were a
    father and his two sons, father about forty-five and sons
    eighteen or nineteen. The evidence shows them to have recently
    escaped. The father is the brother of the Rev. Dr. Pennington, a
    highly respected colored preacher of this city.





    NEW YORK, May 28.

    Last evening the church at the corner of Prince and Marion
    streets was filled with an intelligent audience of white and
    colored people, to hear Dr. Pennington relate the circumstance
    connected with the arrest of his brother and nephews. He showed,
    that he attempted to afford his brother the assistance of
    counsel, but was unable to do so, the officers at the Marshal's
    office having deceived him in relation to the time the trial was
    to take place before the Commissioners. Hon. E.F. Culver next
    addressed the audience, showing, that a great injustice had been
    done to the brother of Dr. Pennington, and though he, up to that
    time, had advocated peace, he now had the spirit to tear down
    the building over the Marshal's head. Intense interest was
    manifested during the proceedings, and much sympathy in behalf
    of Dr. Pennington.





    THE FUGITIVE SLAVES IN BALTIMORE.

    The U.S. Marshal, A.T. Hillyer, Esq., received a dispatch this
    morning from officers Horton and Dellugelis, at Baltimore,
    stating, that they had arrived there with the three slaves,
    arrested here yesterday (the Penningtons), the owners
    accompanying them. The officers will return to New York, this
    evening.--_N.Y. Express_, 27_th_.





    NEW YORK, May 30.

    The Rev. Dr. Pennington has received a letter from Mr. Grove,
    the claimant of his brother, who was recently taken back from
    this city, offering to sell him to Dr. Pennington, should he
    wish to buy him, and stating, that he would await a reply,
    before "selling him to the slave-drivers." Mr. Groce, who
    accompanied his "sweet heart," Matilda, in the same train which
    conveyed the Penningtons to New York, had reason to apprehend
    danger to all the Underground Rail Road passengers, as will
    appear from his subjoined letter:


        ELMIRA, May 28th.

        DEAR LUKE:--I arrived home safe with my precious charge,
        and found all well. I have just learned, that the
        Penningtons are taken. Had he done as I wished him he
        would never have been taken. Last night our tall friend
        from Baltimore came, and caused great excitement here by
        his information. The lady is perfectly safe now in
        Canada. I will write you and Mr. Still as soon as I get
        over the excitement. This letter was first intended for
        Mr. Gains, but I now send it to you. Please let me hear
        their movements.

        Yours truly,

        C.L. GROCE.



But sadly as this blow was felt by the Vigilance Committee, it did not
cause them to relax their efforts in the least. Indeed it only served to
stir them up to renewed diligence and watchfulness, although for a
length of time afterwards the Committee felt disposed, when sending, to
avoid New York as much as possible, and in lieu thereof, to send _viâ_
Elmira, where there was a depot under the agency of John W. Jones. Mr.
Jones was a true and prompt friend of the fugitive, and wide-awake with
regard to Slavery and slave-holders, and slave hunters, for he had known
from sad experience in Virginia every trait of character belonging to
these classes.

In the midst of the Doctor's grief, friends of the slave soon raised
money to purchase his brother, about $1,000; but the unfortunate sons
were doomed to the auction block and the far South, where, the writer
has never exactly learned.



"FLEEING GIRL OF FIFTEEN," IN MALE ATTIRE.


PROFESSORS H. AND T. OFFER THEIR SERVICES--CAPTAINS B. ALSO ARE
ENLISTED--SLAVE-TRADER GRASPING TIGHTLY HIS PREY, BUT SHE IS
RESCUED--LONG CONFLICT, BUT GREAT TRIUMPH--ARRIVAL ON THANKSGIVING DAY,
NOV. 25, 1855. It was the business of the Vigilance Committee, as it was
clearly understood by the friends of the Slave, to assist all needy
fugitives, who might in any way manage to reach Philadelphia, but, for
various reasons, not to send agents South to incite slaves to run away,
or to assist them in so doing. Sometimes, however, this rule could not
altogether be conformed to. Cases, in some instances, would appeal so
loudly and forcibly to humanity, civilization, and Christianity, that it
would really seem as if the very stones would cry out, unless something
was done. As an illustration of this point, the story of the young girl,
which is now to be related, will afford the most striking proof. At the
same time it may be seen how much anxiety, care, hazard, delay and
material aid, were required in order to effect the deliverance of some
who were in close places, and difficult of access. It will be necessary
to present a considerable amount of correspondence in this case, to
bring to light the hidden mysteries of this narrative. The first letter,
in explanation, is the following:



LETTER FROM J. BIGELOW, ESQ.



    WASHINGTON, D.C., June 27, 1854.

    MR. WM. STILL--_Dear Sir_:--I have to thank you for the prompt
    answer you had the kindness to give to my note of 22d inst.
    Having found a correspondence so quick and easy, and withal so
    very flattering, I address you again more fully.

    The liberal appropriation for _transportation_ has been made
    chiefly on account of a female child of ten or eleven years old,
    for whose purchase I have been authorized to offer $700
    (refused), and for whose sister I have paid $1,600, and some
    $1,000 for their mother, &c.

    This child sleeps in the same apartment with its master and
    mistress, which adds to the difficulty of removal. She is some
    ten or twelve miles from the city, so that really the chief
    hazard will be in bringing her safely to town, and in secreting
    her until a few days of _storm_ shall have abated. All this, I
    think, is now provided for with entire safety.

    The child has two cousins in the immediate vicinity; a young man
    of some twenty-two years of age, and his sister, of perhaps
    seventeen--_both Slaves_, but bright and clear-headed as
    anybody. The young man I have seen often--the services of _both_
    seem indispensable to the main object suggested; but having once
    rendered the service, they cannot, and ought not return to
    Slavery. They look for _freedom_ as the reward of what they
    shall now do.

    Out of the $300, cheerfully offered for the whole enterprise, I
    must pay some reasonable sum for transportation to the city and
    sustenance while here. It cannot be much; for the balance, I
    shall give a draft, which will be _promptly paid_ on their
    arrival in New York.

    If I have been understood to offer the whole $300, _it shall be
    paid_, though I have meant as above stated. Among the various
    ways that have been suggested, has been that of taking _all of
    them_ into the cars here; that, I think, will be found
    impracticable. I find so much vigilance at the depot, that I
    would not deem it safe, though, in any kind of carriage they
    might leave in safety at any time.

    All the rest I leave to the experience and sagacity of the
    gentleman who maps out the enterprise.

    Now I will thank you to reply to this and let me know that it
    reaches you in safety, and is not put in a careless place,
    whereby I may be endangered; and state also, whether all my
    propositions are understood and acceptable, and whether, (pretty
    quickly after I shall inform you that _all things are ready_),
    the gentleman will make his appearance?

    I live alone. My office and bed-room, &c., are at the corner of
    E. and 7th streets, opposite the east end of the General Post
    Office, where any one may call upon me.

    It would, of course, be imprudent, that this letter, or any
    other _written_ particulars, be in his pockets for fear of
    accident.

    Yours very respectfully,

    J. BIGELOW.


While this letter clearly brought to light the situation of things, its
author, however, had scarcely begun to conceive of the numberless
difficulties which stood in the way of success before the work could be
accomplished. The information which Mr. Bigelow's letter contained of
the painful situation of this young girl was submitted to different
parties who could be trusted, with a view of finding a person who might
possess sufficient courage to undertake to bring her away. Amongst those
consulted were two or three captains who had on former occasions done
good service in the cause. One of these captains was known in
Underground Rail-Road circles as the "powder boy."[A] He was willing to
undertake the work, and immediately concluded to make a visit to
Washington, to see how the "land lay." Accordingly in company with
another Underground Rail Road captain, he reported himself one day to
Mr. Bigelow with as much assurance as if he were on an errand for an
office under the government. The impression made on Mr. Bigelow's mind
may be seen from the following letter; it may also be seen that he was
fully alive to the necessity of precautionary measures.

[Footnote A: He had been engaged at different times in carrying powder
in his boat from a powder magazine, and from this circumstance, was
familiarly called the "Powder Boy."]



SECOND LETTER FROM LAWYER BIGELOW.



    WASHINGTON, D.C., September 9th, 1855.

    MR. WM. STILL, DEAR SIR:--I strongly hope the little matter of
    business so long pending and about which I have written you so
    many times, will take a move now. I have the promise that the
    merchandize shall be delivered in this city to-night. Like so
    many other promises, this also may prove a failure, though I
    have reason to believe that it will not. I shall, however, know
    before I mail this note. In case the goods arrive here I shall
    hope to see your long-talked of "Professional gentleman" in
    Washington, as soon as possible. He will find me by the enclosed
    card, which shall be a satisfactory introduction for him. You
    have never given me his name, nor am I anxious to know it. But
    on a pleasant visit made last fall to friend Wm. Wright, in
    Adams Co., I suppose I accidentally learned it to be a certain
    Dr. H----. Well, let him come.

    I had an interesting call a week ago from two gentlemen, masters
    of vessels, and brothers, one of whom, I understand, you know as
    the "powder boy." I had a little light freight for them; but not
    finding enough other freight to ballast their craft, they went
    down the river looking for wheat, and promising to return soon.
    I hope to see them often.

    I hope this may find you returned from your northern trip,[A] as
    your time proposed was out two or three days ago.

    the fugitives to Canada.]

    printed, you will send me the copy as proposed.

    I forwarded some of her things to Boston a few days ago, and had
    I known its importance in court, I could have sent you one or
    two witnesses who would prove that her freedom was intended by
    her before she left Washington, and that a man was _engaged_
    here to go on to Philadelphia the same day with her to give
    notice there of her case, though I think he failed to do so. It
    was beyond all question her purpose, _before leaving Washington
    and provable too_, that if Wheeler should make her a free woman
    by taking her to a free state "_to use it rather_."

    Tuesday, 11th September. The attempt was made on Sunday to
    forward the merchandize, but failed through no fault of any of
    the parties that I now know of. It will be repeated soon, and
    you shall know the result.

    "Whorra for Judge Kane." I feel so indignant at the man, that it
    is not easy to write the foregoing sentence, and yet who is
    helping our cause like Kane and Douglas, not forgetting
    Stringfellow. I hope soon to know that this reaches you in
    safety.

    It often happens that light freight would be offered to Captain
    B., but the owners cannot by possibility _advance_ the amount of
    freight. I wish it were possible in some such extreme cases,
    that after advancing _all they have_, some public fund should be
    found to pay the balance or at least lend it.

    [I wish here to caution you against the supposition that I would
    do any act, or say a word towards helping servants to escape.
    Although I hate slavery so much, I keep my hands clear of any
    such wicked or illegal act.]

    Yours, very truly,

    J.B.

    Will you recollect, hereafter, that in any of my future letters,
    in which I may use [] whatever words may be within the brackets
    are intended to have no signification whatever to you, only to
    blind the eyes of the uninitiated. You will find an example at
    the close of my letter.


Up to this time the chances seemed favorable of procuring the ready
services of either of the above mentioned captains who visited Lawyer
Bigelow for the removal of the merchandize to Philadelphia, providing
the shipping master could have it in readiness to suit their
convenience. But as these captains had a number of engagements at
Richmond, Petersburg, &c., it was not deemed altogether safe to rely
upon either of them, consequently in order to be prepared in case of an
emergency, the matter was laid before two professional gentlemen who
were each occupying chairs in one of the medical colleges of
Philadelphia. They were known to be true friends of the slave, and had
possessed withal some experience in Underground Rail Road matters.
Either of these professors was willing to undertake the operation,
provided arrangements could be completed in time to be carried out
during the vacation. In this hopeful, although painfully indefinite
position the matter remained for more than a year; but the
correspondence and anxiety increased, and with them disappointments and
difficulties multiplied. The hope of Freedom, however, buoyed up the
heart of the young slave girl during the long months of anxious waiting
and daily expectation for the hour of deliverance to come. Equally true
and faithful also did Mr. Bigelow prove to the last; but at times he had
some painfully dark seasons to encounter, as may be seen from the
subjoined letter:


    WASHINGTON, D.C., October 6th, 1855.

    MR. STILL, DEAR SIR:--I regret exceedingly to learn by your
    favor of 4th instant, that all things are not ready. Although I
    cannot speak of any immediate and positive danger. [_Yet it is
    well known that the city is full of incendiaries_.]

    Perhaps you are aware that any colored citizen is liable at any
    hour of day or night without any show of authority to have his
    house ransacked by constables, and if others do it and commit
    the most outrageous depredations none but white witnesses can
    convict them. Such outrages are always common here, and no kind
    of property exposed to colored protection only, can be
    considered safe. [I don't say that _much liberty_ should not be
    given to constables on account of numerous runaways, but it
    don't always work for good.] Before advertising they go round
    and offer rewards to sharp colored men of perhaps _one or two
    hundred dollars_, to betray runaways, and having discovered
    their hiding-place, seize them and then cheat their informers
    out of the money.

    [_Although a law-abiding man_,] I am anxious in this case of
    _innocence_ to raise no conflict or suspicion. [_Be sure that
    the manumission is full and legal_.] And as I am _powerless_
    without your aid, _I pray you_ don't lose a moment in giving me
    relief. The idea of waiting yet for weeks seems dreadful; do
    reduce it to days if possible, and give me notice of the
    _earliest possible time_.

    The property is not yet advertised, but will be, [and if we
    delay too long, may be sold and lost.]

    It was a great misunderstanding, though not your fault, that so
    much delay would be necessary. [I repeat again that I must have
    the thing done legally, therefore, please get a good lawyer to
    draw up the deed of manumission.]

    Yours Truly,

    J. BIGELOW.


Great was the anxiety felt in Washington. It is certainly not too much
to say, that an equal amount of anxiety existed in Philadelphia
respecting the safety of the merchandise. At this juncture Mr. Bigelow
had come to the conclusion that it was no longer safe to write over his
own name, but that he would do well to henceforth adopt the name of the
renowned Quaker, Wm. Penn, (he was worthy of it) as in the case of the
following letter.


    WASHINGTON, D.C., November 10th, 1855.

    DEAR SIR:--Doctor T. presented my card last night about half
    past eight which I instantly recognized. I, however, soon became
    suspicious, and afterwards confounded, to find the doctor using
    your name and the well known names of Mr. McK. and Mr. W. and
    yet, neither he nor I, could conjecture the object of his visit.

    The doctor is agreeable and sensible, and doubtless a
    true-hearted man. He seemed to see the whole matter as I did,
    and was embarrassed. He had nothing to propose, no information
    to give of the "P. Boy," or of any substitute, and seemed to
    want no particular information from me concerning my anxieties
    and perils, though I stated them to him, but found him as
    powerless as myself to give me relief. I had an agreeable
    interview with the doctor till after ten, when he left,
    intending to take the cars at six, as I suppose he did do, this
    morning.

    This morning after eight, I got your letter of the 9th, but it
    gives me but little enlightenment or satisfaction. You simply
    say that the doctor is a _true man_, which I cannot doubt, that
    you thought it best we should have an interview, and that you
    supposed I would meet the expenses. You informed me also that
    the "P. Boy" left for Richmond, on Friday, the 2d, to be gone
    _the length of time named in your last_, I must infer that to be
    _ten days_ though in your last _you assured me_ that the "P.
    Boy" would certainly start for _this place_ (not Richmond) in
    two or three days, though the difficulty about freight might
    cause delay, and the whole enterprise might not be accomplished
    under ten days, &c., &c. That time having elapsed and I having
    agreed to an extra fifty dollars to ensure promptness. I have
    scarcely left my office since, except for my hasty meals,
    awaiting his arrival. You now inform me he has gone to Richmond,
    to be gone ten days, which will expire tomorrow, but you do not
    say he will return here or to Phila, or where, at the expiration
    of that time, and Dr. T. could tell me nothing whatever about
    him. Had he been able to tell me that this _best plan_, which I
    have so long rested upon, would fail, or was abandoned, I could
    then understand it, but he says no such thing, and you say, as
    you have twice before said, "ten days more."

    Now, my dear sir, after this recapitulation, can you not see
    that I have reason for great embarrassment? I have given
    assurances, both here and in New York, founded on your
    assurances to me, and caused my friends in the latter place
    great anxiety, so much that I have had no way to explain my own
    letters but by sending your last two to Mr. Tappan.

    I cannot doubt, I do not, but that you wish to help me, and the
    cause too, for which both of us have made many and large
    sacrifices with no hope of reward in this world. If in this case
    I have been very urgent since September Dr. T. can give you some
    of my reasons, they have not been selfish.

    The whole matter is in a nutshell. Can I, in your opinion,
    depend on the "P. Boy," and when?

    If he promises to come here next trip, will he come, or go to
    Richmond? This I think is the best way. Can I depend on it?

    Dr. T. promised to write me some explanation and give some
    advice, and at first I thought to await his letter, but on
    second thought concluded to tell you how I feel, as I have done.

    Will you answer my questions with some explicitness, and without
    delay?

    I forgot to inquire of Dr. T. who is the head of your Vigilance
    Committee, whom I may address concerning other and further
    operations?

    Yours very truly,

    WM. PENN.

    P.S. I ought to say, that I have no doubt but there were good
    reasons for the P. Boy's going to Richmond instead of W.; _but
    what can they be_?


Whilst there are a score of other interesting letters, bearing on this
case, the above must suffice, to give at least, an idea of the
perplexities and dangers attending its early history. Having
accomplished this end, a more encouraging and pleasant phase of the
transaction may now be introduced. Here the difficulties, at least very
many of them, vanish, yet in one respect, the danger became most
imminent. The following letter shows that the girl had been successfully
rescued from her master, and that a reward of five hundred dollars had
been offered for her.


    WASHINGTON, D.C., October 12, 1855.

    MR. WM. STILL:--AS YOU PICK UP ALL THE NEWS THAT IS STIRRING, I
    CONTRIBUTE A FEW SCRAPS TO YOUR STOCK, GOING TO SHOW THAT THE
    POOR SLAVE-HOLDERS HAVE THEIR TROUBLES AS WELL AS OTHER PEOPLE.

    FOUR HEAVY LOSSES ON ONE SMALL SCRAP CUT FROM A SINGLE NUMBER OF
    THE "SUN!" HOW VEXATIOUS! HOW PROVOKING! ON THE OTHER HAND,
    THINK OF THE POOR, TIMID, BREATHLESS, FLYING CHILD OF FIFTEEN!
    FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD! OH, FOR SUCCOR! TO WHOM IN ALL THIS
    WIDE LAND OF FREEDOM SHALL SHE FLEE AND FIND SAFETY?
    ALAS!--ALAS!--THE LAW POINTS TO NO ONE!

    IS SHE STILL RUNNING WITH BLEEDING FEET?[A] OR HIDES SHE IN SOME
    COLD CAVE, TO REST AND STARVE? "$500 REWARD." YOURS, FOR THE
    WEAK AND THE POOR. PERISH THE REWARD.

    [Footnote A: At the time this letter was written, she was then
    under Mr. B.'s protection in Washington, and had to be so kept
    for six weeks. His question, therefore, "is she still running
    with bleeding feet," etc., was simply a precautionary step to
    blind any who might perchance investigate the matter.]

    J.B.


Having thus succeeded in getting possession of, and secreting this
fleeing child of fifteen, as best they could, in Washington, all
concerned were compelled to "possess their souls in patience," until the
storm had passed. Meanwhile, the "child of fifteen" was christened "Joe
Wright," and dressed in male attire to prepare for traveling as a lad.
As no opportunity had hitherto presented itself, whereby to prepare the
"package" for shipment, from Washington, neither the "powder boy" nor
Dr. T.[B] was prepared to attend to the removal, at this critical
moment. The emergency of the case, however, cried loudly for aid. The
other professional gentleman (Dr. H.), was now appealed to, but his
engagements in the college forbade his absence before about Thanksgiving
day, which was then six weeks off. This fact was communicated to
Washington, and it being the only resource left, the time named was
necessarily acquiesced in. In the interim, "Joe" was to perfect herself
in the art of wearing pantaloons, and all other male rig. Soon the days
and weeks slid by, although at first the time for waiting seemed long,
when, according to promise, Dr. H. was in Washington, with his horse and
buggy prepared for duty. The impressions made by Dr. H., on William
Penn's mind, at his first interview, will doubtless be interesting to
all concerned, as may be seen in the following letter:

[Footnote B: Dr. T. was one of the professional gentlemen alluded to
above, who had expressed a willingness to act as an agent in the
matter.]


    WASHINGTON, D.C., November 26, 1855.

    MY DEAR SIR:--A recent letter from my friend, probably has led
    you to expect this from me. He was delighted to receive yours of
    the 23d, stating that the boy was _all right_. He found the
    "Prof. gentleman" a _perfect gentleman_; cool, quiet,
    thoughtful, and _perfectly competent to execute his
    undertaking_. At the first three minutes of their interview, he
    felt assured that all would be right. He, and all concerned,
    give you and that gentleman sincere thanks for what you have
    done. May the blessings of Him, who cares for the poor, be on
    your heads.

    The especial object of this, is to inform you that there is a
    half dozen or so of packages here, _pressing for
    transportation_; twice or thrice that number are also pressing,
    but less so than the others. Their aggregate means will average,
    say, $10 each; besides these, we know of a few, say three or
    four, _able and smart_, but utterly destitute, and kept so
    purposely by their oppressors. For all these, we feel deeply
    interested; $10 each would not be enough for the "powder boy."
    Is there any fund from which a pittance could be spared to help
    these poor creatures? I don't doubt but that they would honestly
    repay a small loan as soon as they could earn it. I know full
    well, that if you begin with such cases, there is no boundary at
    which you can stop. For years, one half at least, of my friend's
    time here has been gratuitously given to cases of distress among
    this class. He never expects or desires to do less; he literally
    has the _poor always with him_. He knows that it is so with you
    also, therefore, he only states the case, being especially
    anxious for at least those to whom I have referred.

    [Illustration: MARIA WEEMS ESCAPING IN MALE ATTIRE]

    I think a small lot of hard coal might always be sold here _from
    the vessel_ at a profit. Would not a like lot of Cumberland coal
    always sell in Philadelphia?

    My friend would be very glad to see the powder boy here again,
    and if he brings coal, there are those here, who would try to
    help him sell.

    Reply to your regular correspondent as usual.

    WM. PENN.


By the presence of the Dr., confidence having been reassured that all
would be right, as well as by the "inner light," William Penn
experienced a great sense of relief. Everything having been duly
arranged, the doctor's horse and carriage stood waiting before the White
House (William Penn preferred this place as a starting point, rather
than before his own office door). It being understood that "Joe" was to
act as coachman in passing out of Washington, at this moment he was
called for, and in the most polite and natural manner, with the
fleetness of a young deer, he jumped into the carriage, took the reins
and whip, whilst the doctor and William Penn were cordially shaking
hands and bidding adieu. This done, the order was given to Joe, "drive
on." Joe bravely obeyed. The faithful horse trotted off willingly, and
the doctor sat in his carriage as composed as though he had succeeded in
procuring an honorable and lucrative office from the White House, and
was returning home to tell his wife the good news. The doctor had some
knowledge of the roads, also some acquaintances in Maryland, through
which State he had to travel; therefore, after leaving the suburbs of
Washington, the doctor took the reins in his own hands, as he felt that
he was more experienced as a driver than his young coachman. He was also
mindful of the fact, that, before reaching Pennsylvania, his faithful
beast would need feeding several times, and that they consequently would
be obliged to pass one or two nights at least in Maryland, either at a
tavern or farm-house.

In reflecting upon the matter, it occurred to the doctor, that in
earlier days, he had been quite intimately acquainted with a farmer and
his family (who were slave-holders), in Maryland, and that he would
about reach their house at the end of the first day's journey. He
concluded that he could do no better than to renew his acquaintance with
his old friends on this occasion. After a very successful day's travel,
night came on, and the doctor was safely at the farmer's door with his
carriage and waiter boy; the doctor was readily recognized by the farmer
and his family, who seemed glad to see him; indeed, they made quite a
"fuss" over him. As a matter of strategy, the doctor made quite a "fuss"
over them in return; nevertheless, he did not fail to assume airs of
importance, which were calculated to lead them to think that he had
grown older and wiser than when they knew him in his younger days. In
casually referring to the manner of his traveling, he alluded to the
fact, that he was not very well, and as it had been a considerable
length of time since he had been through that part of the country, he
thought that the drive would do him good, and especially the sight of
old familiar places and people. The farmer and his family felt
themselves exceedingly honored by the visit from the distinguished
doctor, and manifested a marked willingness to spare no pains to render
his night's lodging in every way comfortable.

The Dr. being an educated and intelligent gentleman, well posted on
other questions besides medicine, could freely talk about farming in all
its branches, and "niggers" too, in an emergency, so the evening passed
off pleasantly with the Dr. in the parlor, and "Joe" in the kitchen. The
Dr., however, had given "Joe" precept upon precept, "here a little, and
there a little," as to how he should act in the presence of master white
people, or slave colored people, and thus he was prepared to act his
part with due exactness. Before the evening grew late, the Dr., fearing
some accident, intimated, that he was feeling a "little languid," and
therefore thought that he had better "retire." Furthermore he added,
that he was "liable to vertigo," when not quite well, and for this
reason he must have his boy "Joe" sleep in the room with him. "Simply
give him a bed quilt and he will fare well enough in one corner of the
room," said the Dr. The proposal was readily acceded to, and carried
into effect by the accommodating host. The Dr. was soon in bed, sleeping
soundly, and "Joe," in his new coat and pants, wrapped up in the bed
quilt, in a corner of the room quite comfortably.

The next morning the Dr. arose at as early an hour as was prudent for a
gentleman of his position, and feeling refreshed, partook of a good
breakfast, and was ready, with his boy, "Joe," to prosecute their
journey. Face, eyes, hope, and steps, were set as flint,
Pennsylvania-ward. What time the following day or night they crossed
Mason and Dixon's line is not recorded on the Underground Rail Road
books, but at four o'clock on Thanksgiving Day, the Dr. safely landed
the "fleeing girl of fifteen" at the residence of the writer in
Philadelphia. On delivering up his charge, the Dr. simply remarked to
the writer's wife, "I wish to leave this young lad with you a short
while, and I will call and see further about him." Without further
explanation, he stepped into his carriage and hurried away, evidently
anxious to report himself to his wife, in order to relieve her mind of a
great weight of anxiety on his account. The writer, who happened to be
absent from home when the Dr. called, returned soon afterwards. "The Dr.
has been here" (he was the family physician), "and left this 'young
lad,' and said, that he would call again and see about him," said Mrs.
S. The "young lad" was sitting quite composedly in the dining-room, with
his cap on. The writer turned to him and inquired, "I suppose you are
the person that the Dr. went to Washington after, are you not?" "No,"
said "Joe." "Where are you from then?" was the next question. "From
York, sir." "From York? Why then did the Dr. bring you here?" was the
next query, "the Dr. went expressly to Washington after a young girl,
who was to be brought away dressed up as a boy, and I took you to be the
person." Without replying "the lad" arose and walked out of the house.
The querist, somewhat mystified, followed him, and then when the two
were alone, "the lad" said, "I am the one the Dr. went after." After
congratulating her, the writer asked why she had said, that she was not
from Washington, but from York. She explained, that the Dr. had strictly
charged her not to own to any person, except the writer, that she was
from Washington, but from York. As there were persons present (wife,
hired girl, and a fugitive woman), when the questions were put to her,
she felt that it would be a violation of her pledge to answer in the
affirmative. Before this examination, neither of the individuals present
for a moment entertained the slightest doubt but that she was a "lad,"
so well had she acted her part in every particular. She was dressed in a
new suit, which fitted her quite nicely, and with her unusual amount of
common sense, she appeared to be in no respect lacking. To send off a
prize so rare and remarkable, as she was, without affording some of the
stockholders and managers of the Road the pleasure of seeing her, was
not to be thought of. In addition to the Vigilance Committee, quite a
number of persons were invited to see her, and were greatly astonished.
Indeed it was difficult to realize, that she was not a boy, even after
becoming acquainted with the facts in the case.

The following is an exact account of this case, as taken from the
Underground Rail Road records:


    "THANKSGIVING DAY, Nov., 1855.

    Arrived, Ann Maria Weems, _alias_ 'Joe Wright,' _alias_ 'Ellen
    Capron,' from Washington, through the aid of Dr. H. She is about
    fifteen years of age, bright mulatto, well grown, smart and
    good-looking. For the last three years, or about that length of
    time, she has been owned by Charles M. Price, a negro trader, of
    Rockville, Maryland. Mr. P. was given to 'intemperance,' to a
    very great extent, and gross 'profanity.' He buys and sells many
    slaves in the course of the year. 'His wife is cross and
    peevish.' She used to take great pleasure in 'torturing' one
    'little slave boy.' He was the son of his master (and was owned
    by him); this was the chief cause of the mistress' spite."

    Ann Maria had always desired her freedom from childhood, and
    although not thirteen, when first advised to escape, she
    received the suggestion without hesitation, and ever after that
    time waited almost daily, for more than two years, the chance to
    flee. Her friends were, of course, to aid her, and make
    arrangements for her escape. Her owner, fearing that she might
    escape, for a long time compelled her to sleep in the chamber
    with "her master and mistress;" indeed she was so kept until
    about three weeks before she fled. She left her parents living
    in Washington. Three of her brothers had been sold South from
    their parents. Her mother had been purchased for $1,000, and one
    of her sisters for $1,600 for freedom. Before Ann Maria was
    thirteen years of age $700 was offered for her by a friend, who
    desired to procure her freedom, but the offer was promptly
    refused, as were succeeding ones repeatedly made. The only
    chance of procuring her freedom, depended upon getting her away
    on the Underground Rail Road. She was neatly attired in male
    habiliments, and in that manner came all the way from
    Washington. After passing two or three days with her new friends
    in Philadelphia, she was sent on (in male attire) to Lewis
    Tappan, of New York, who had likewise been deeply interested in
    her case from the beginning, and who held himself ready, as was
    understood, to cash a draft for three hundred dollars to
    compensate the man who might risk his own liberty in bringing
    her on from Washington. After having arrived safely in New York,
    she found a home and kind friends in the family of the Rev. A.N.
    Freeman, and received quite an ovation characteristic of an
    Underground Rail Road.

    After having received many tokens of esteem and kindness from
    the friends of the slave in New York and Brooklyn, she was
    carefully forwarded on to Canada, to be educated at the "Buxton
    Settlement."


An interesting letter, however, from the mother of Ann Maria, conveying
the intelligence of her late great struggle and anxiety in laboring to
free her last child from Slavery is too important to be omitted, and
hence is inserted in connection with this narrative.



LETTER FROM THE MOTHER.



    WASHINGTON, D.C., September 19th, 1857.

    WM. STILL, ESQ., Philadelphia, Pa. SIR:--I have just sent for my
    son Augustus, in Alabama. I have sent eleven hundred dollars
    which pays for his body and some thirty dollars to pay his fare
    to Washington. I borrowed one hundred and eighty dollars to make
    out the eleven hundred dollars. I was not very successful in
    Syracuse. I collected only twelve dollars, and in Rochester only
    two dollars. I did not know that the season was so unpropitious.
    The wealthy had all gone to the springs. They must have returned
    by this time. I hope you will exert yourself and help me get a
    part of the money I owe, at least. I am obliged to pay it by the
    12th of next month. I was unwell when I returned through
    Philadelphia, or I should have called. I had been from home five
    weeks.

    My son Augustus is the last of the family in Slavery. I feel
    rejoiced that he is soon to be free and with me, and of course
    feel the greatest solicitude about raising the one hundred and
    eighty dollars I have borrowed of a kind friend, or who has
    borrowed it for me at bank. I hope and pray you will help me as
    far as possible. Tell Mr. Douglass to remember me, and if he
    can, to interest his friends for me.

    You will recollect that five hundred dollars of our money was
    taken to buy the sister of Henry H. Garnett's wife. Had I been
    able to command this I should not be necessitated to ask the
    favors and indulgences I do.

    I am expecting daily the return of Augustus, and may Heaven
    grant him a safe deliverance and smile propitiously upon you and
    all kind friends who have aided in his return to me.

    Be pleased to remember me to friends, and accept yourself the

That William Penn who worked so faithfully for two years for the
deliverance of Ann Maria may not appear to have been devoting all his
time and sympathy towards this single object it seems expedient that two
or three additional letters, proposing certain grand Underground Rail
Road plans, should have a place here. For this purpose, therefore, the
following letters are subjoined.



LETTERS FROM WILLIAM PENN.



    WASHINGTON, D.C., Oct. 3, 1854

    DEAR SIR:--I address you to-day chiefly at the suggestion of the
    Lady who will hand you my letter, and who is a resident of your
    city.

    After stating to you, that the case about which I have
    previously written, remains just as it was when I wrote
    last--full of difficulty--I thought I would call your attention
    to another enterprise; it is this: to find a man with a large
    heart for doing good to the oppressed, who will come to
    Washington to live, and who will _walk out to Penn'a., or a part
    of the way there, once or twice a week_. He will find parties
    who will _pay him for doing so_. Parties of say, two, three,
    five or so, who will pay him _at least_ $5 each, for the
    privilege of following him, but _will never speak to him_; but
    will keep just in sight of him and obey any sign he may give;
    say, he takes off his hat and scratches his head as a sign for
    them to go to some barn or wood to rest, &c. No living being
    shall be found to say he ever spoke to them. A white man would
    be best, and then even parties led out by him could not, if they
    would, testify to any _understanding_ or anything else against a
    white man. I think he might make a good living at it. Can it not
    be done?

    If one or two safe stopping-places could be found on the
    way--such as a barn or shed, they could walk quite safely all
    night and then sleep all day--about two, or _easily_ three
    nights would convey them to a place of safety. The traveler
    might be a peddler or huckster, with an old horse and cart, and
    bring us in eggs and butter if he pleases.

    Let him once plan out his route, and he might then take ten or a
    dozen at a time, and they are often able and willing to pay $10
    a piece.

    I have a hard case now on hand; a brother and sister 23 to 25
    years old, whose mother lives in your city. They are cruelly
    treated; they want to go, they _ought_ to go; but they are
    utterly destitute. Can nothing be done for such cases? If you
    can think of anything let me know it. I suppose you know me?





    WASHINGTON, D.C., April 3, 1856.

    DEAR SIR:--I sent you the recent law of Virginia, under which
    all vessels are to be searched for fugitives within the waters
    of that State.

    It was long ago suggested by a sagacious friend, that the
    "powder boy" might find a better port in the Chesapeake bay, or
    in the Patuxent river to communicate with this vicinity, than by
    entering the Potomac river, even were there no such law.

    Suppose he opens a trade with some place south-west of
    Annapolis, 25 or 30 miles from here, or less. He might carry
    wood, oysters, &c., and all his customers from this vicinity
    might travel in _that direction_ without any of the suspicions
    that might attend their journeyings _towards this city_. In this
    way, doubtless, a good business might be carried on without
    interruption or competition, and provided the plan was conducted
    without affecting the inhabitants along that shore, no suspicion
    would arise as to the manner or magnitude of his business
    operations. How does this strike you? What does the "powder boy"
    think of it?

    I heretofore intimated a _pressing necessity_ on the part of
    several females--they are variously situated--two have children,
    say a couple each; some have none--of the latter, one can raise
    $50, another, say 30 or 40 dollars--another who was gazetted
    last August (a copy sent you), can raise, through her friends,
    20 or 30 dollars, &c., &c. None of these can walk so far or so
    fast as scores of _men_ that are constantly leaving. I cannot
    shake off my anxiety for these poor creatures. Can you think of
    anything for any of these? Address your other correspondent in
    answer to this at your leisure.

    Yours,

    WM. PENN.

    P.S.--April 3d. Since writing the above, I have received yours
    of 31st. I am rejoiced to hear that business is so successful
    and prosperous--may it continue till _the article_ shall cease
    to be merchandize.

    I spoke in my last letter of the departure of a "few friends." I
    have since heard of their good health in Penn'a. Probably you
    may have seen them.

    In reference to the expedition of which you think you can "hold
    out some little encouragement," I will barely remark, that I
    shall be glad, if it is undertaken, to have all the notice of
    the _time and manner_ that is possible, so as to make ready.

    A friend of mine says, anthracite coal will always pay here from
    Philadelphia, and thinks a small vessel might run often--that
    she never would be searched in the Potomac, unless she went
    outside.

    You advise caution towards Mr. P. I am precisely of your opinion
    about him, that he is a "queer stick," and while I advised him
    carefully in reference to his own undertakings, I took no
    counsel of him concerning mine.

    Yours,

    W.P.





    WASHINGTON, D.C., April 23d, 1856.

    DEAR SIR:--I have to thank you for your last two encouraging
    letters of 31st of March and 7th April. I have seen nothing in
    the papers to interest you, and having bad health and a press of
    other engagements, I have neglected to write you.

    Enclosed is a list of persons referred to in my last letter, all
    most anxious to travel--all meritorious. In some of these I feel
    an especial interest for what they have done to help others in
    distress.

    I suggest for yours and the "powder boy's" consideration the
    following plan: that he shall take in coal for Washington and
    come directly here--sell his coal and go to Georgetown for
    freight, and _wait_ for it. If any fancy articles are sent on
    board, _I understand he has a place_ to put them in, and _if he
    has_ I suggest that he lies still, still waiting for freight
    till the first anxiety is over. Vessels that have _just left_
    are the ones that will be inquired after, and perhaps chased. If
    he lays still a day or two all suspicion will be prevented. If
    there shall be occasion to refer to any of them hereafter, it
    may be by their numbers in the list.

    The family--5 to 11--will be missed and inquired after soon and
    urgently; 12 and 13 will also be soon missed, but _none of the
    others_.

    If all this can be done, some little time or notice must be had
    to get them all ready. They tell me they can pay the sums marked
    to their names. The aggregate is small, but as I told you, they
    are poor. Let me hear from you when convenient.

FIVE YEARS AND ONE MONTH SECRETED.


JOHN HENRY, HEZEKIAH, AND JAMES HILL.--JOHN MAKES A DESPERATE RESISTANCE
AT THE SLAVE AUCTION AND ESCAPES AFTER BEING SECRETED NINE MONTHS.
HEZEKIAH ESCAPED FROM A TRADER AND WAS SECEETED THIRTEEN MONTHS BEFORE
HIS FINAL DELIVERANCE.--JAMES WAS SECRETED THREE YEARS IN A PLACE OF
GREAT SUFFERING, AND ESCAPED. IN ALL FIVE YEARS AND ONE MONTH.

Many letters from JOHN HENRY show how incessantly his mind ran out
towards the oppressed, and the remarkable intelligence and ability he
displayed with the pen, considering that he had no chance to acquire
book knowledge. After having fled for refuge to Canada and having become
a partaker of impartial freedom under the government of Great Britain,
to many it seemed that the fugitive should be perfectly satisfied. Many
appeared to think that the fugitive, having secured freedom, had but
little occasion for anxiety or care, even for his nearest kin. "Change
your name." "Never tell any one how you escaped." "Never let any one
know where you came from." "Never think of writing back, not even to
your wife; you can do your kin no good, but may do them harm by
writing." "Take care of yourself." "You are free, well, be satisfied
then." "It will do you no good to fret about your wife and children;
that will not get them out of Slavery." Such was the advice often given
to the fugitive. Men who had been slaves themselves, and some who had
aided in the escape of individuals, sometimes urged these sentiments on
men and women whose hearts were almost breaking over the thought that
their dearest and best friends were in chains in the prison-house.
Perhaps it was thoughtlessness on the part of some, and a wish to
inspire due cautiousness on the part of others, that prompted this
advice. Doubtless some did soon forget their friends. They saw no way by
which they could readily communicate with them. Perhaps Slavery had
dealt with them so cruelly, that little hope or aspiration was left in
them.

It was, however, one of the most gratifying facts connected with the
fugitives, the strong love and attachment that they constantly expressed
for their relatives left in the South; the undying faith they had in God
as evinced by their touching appeals on behalf of their fellow-slaves.
But few probably are aware how deeply these feelings were cherished in
the breasts of this people. Forty, fifty, or sixty years, in some
instances elapsed, but this ardent sympathy and love continued warm and
unwavering as ever. Children left to the cruel mercy of slave-holders,
could never be forgotten. Brothers and sisters could not refrain from
weeping over the remembrance of their separation on the auction block:
of having seen innocent children, feeble and defenceless women in the
grasp of a merciless tyrant, pleading, groaning, and crying in vain for
pity. Not to remember those thus bruised and mangled, it would seem
alike unnatural, and impossible. Therefore it is a source of great
satisfaction to be able, in relating these heroic escapes, to present
the evidences of the strong affections of this greatly oppressed race.

JOHN HENRY never forgot those with whom he had been a fellow-sufferer in
Slavery; he was always fully awake to their wrongs, and longed to be
doing something to aid and encourage such as were striving to get their
Freedom. He wrote many letters in behalf of others, as well as for
himself, the tone of which, was always marked by the most zealous
devotion to the slave, a high sense of the value of Freedom, and
unshaken confidence that God was on the side of the oppressed, and a
strong hope, that the day was not far distant, when the slave power
would be "suddenly broken and that without remedy."

Notwithstanding the literary imperfections of these letters, they are
deemed well suited to these pages. Of course, slaves were not allowed
book learning. Virginia even imprisoned white women for teaching free
colored children the alphabet. Who has forgotten the imprisonment of
Mrs. Douglass for this offense? In view of these facts, no apology is
needed on account of Hill's grammar and spelling.

In these letters, may be seen, how much liberty was valued, how the
taste of Freedom moved the pen of the slave; how the thought of
fellow-bondmen, under the heel of the slave-holder, aroused the spirit
of indignation and wrath; how importunately appeals were made for help
from man and from God; how much joy was felt at the arrival of a
fugitive, and the intense sadness experienced over the news of a failure
or capture of a slave. Not only are the feelings of John Henry Hill
represented in these epistles, but the feelings of very many others
amongst the intelligent fugitives all over the country are also
represented to the letter. It is more with a view of doing justice to a
brave, intelligent class, whom the public are ignorant of, than merely
to give special prominence to John and his relatives as individuals,
that these letters are given.



ESCAPE OF JOHN HENRY HILL FROM THE SLAVE AUCTION IN RICHMOND, ON THE
FIRST DAY OF JANUARY, 1853.


JOHN HENRY at that time, was a little turned of twenty-five years of
age, full six feet high, and remarkably well proportioned in every
respect. He was rather of a brown color, with marked intellectual
features. John was by trade, a carpenter, and was considered a competent
workman. The year previous to his escape, he hired his time, for which
he paid his owner $150. This amount John had fully settled up the last
day of the year. As he was a young man of steady habits, a husband and
father, and withal an ardent lover of Liberty; his owner, John Mitchell,
evidently observed these traits in his character, and concluded that he
was a dangerous piece of property to keep; that his worth in money could
be more easily managed than the man. Consequently, his master
unceremoniously, without intimating in any way to John, that he was to
be sold, took him to Richmond, on the first day of January (the great
annual sale day), and directly to the slave-auction. Just as John was
being taken into the building, he was invited to submit to hand-cuffs.
As the thought flashed upon his mind that he was about to be sold on the
auction-block, he grew terribly desperate. "Liberty or death" was the
watchword of that awful moment. In the twinkling of an eye, he turned on
his enemies, with his fist, knife, and feet, so tiger-like, that he
actually put four or five men to flight, his master among the number.
His enemies thus suddenly baffled, John wheeled, and, as if assisted by
an angel, strange as it may appear, was soon out of sight of his
pursuers, and securely hid away. This was the last hour of John Henry's
slave life, but not, however, of his struggles and sufferings for
freedom, for before a final chance to escape presented itself, nine
months elapsed. The mystery as to where, and how he fared, the following
account, in his own words, must explain--


    Nine months I was trying to get away. I was secreted for a long
    time in a kitchen of a merchant near the corner of Franklyn and
    7th streets, at Richmond, where I was well taken care of, by a
    lady friend of my mother. When I got Tired of staying in that
    place, I wrote myself a pass to pass myself to Petersburg, here
    I stopped with a very prominent Colored person, who was a friend
    to Freedom stayed here until two white friends told other
    friends if I was in the city to tell me to go at once, and stand
    not upon the order of going, because they had hard a plot. I
    wrot a pass, started for Richmond, Reached Manchester, got off
    the Cars walked into Richmond, once more got back into the same
    old Den, Stayed here from the 16th of Aug. to 12th Sept. On the
    11th of Sept. 8 o'clock P.M. a message came to me that there had
    been a State Room taken on the steamer City of Richmond for my
    benefit, and I assured the party that it would be occupied if
    God be willing. Before 10 o'clock the next morning, on the 12th,
    a beautiful Sept. day, I arose early, wrote my pass for Norfolk
    left my old Den with a many a good bye, turned out the back way
    to 7th St., thence to Main, down Main behind 4 night waich to
    old Rockett's and after about 20 minutes of delay I succeed in
    Reaching the State Room. My Conductor was very much Excited, but
    I felt as Composed as I do at this moment, for I had started
    from my Den that morning for Liberty or for Death providing
    myself with a Brace of Pistels.

    Yours truly

    J.H. HILL.


A private berth was procured for him on the steamship City of Richmond,
for the amount of $125, and thus he was brought on safely to
Philadelphia. While in the city, he enjoyed the hospitalities of the
Vigilance Committee, and the greetings of a number of friends, during
the several days of his sojourn. The thought of his wife, and two
children, left in Petersburg, however, naturally caused him much
anxiety. Fortunately, they were free, therefore, he was not without hope
of getting them; moreover, his wife's father (Jack McCraey), was a free
man, well known, and very well to do in the world, and would not be
likely to see his daughter and grandchildren suffer. In this particular,
Hill's lot was of a favorable character, compared with that of most
slaves leaving their wives and children.



FIRST LETTER


ON ARRIVING IN CANADA.



    TORONTO, October 4th, 1853.

    DEAR SIR:--I take this method of informing you that I am well,
    and that I got to this city all safe and sound, though I did not
    get here as soon as I expect. I left your city on Saterday and I

    same day that I left Philadelphia, but I had to stay there untel
    Monday evening. I left that place at six o'clock. I got to
    Albany next morning in time to take the half past six o'clock
    train for Rochester, here I stay untel Wensday night. The reason
    I stay there so long Mr. Gibbs given me a letter to Mr Morris at
    Rochester. I left that place Wensday, but I only got five miles
    from that city that night. I got to Lewiston on Thurday
    afternoon, but too late for the boat to this city. I left
    Lewiston on Friday at one o'clock, got to this city at five. Sir
    I found this to be a very handsome city. I like it better than
    any city I ever saw. It are not as large as the city that you

    in this city. He says that he will give me work next week and
    everybody advises me to work for Mr. Tinsly as there more surity
    in him.

    several days, but have not seen nor heard of them. I hope and
    trust in the Lord Almighty that all things are well with them.

    hear from my wife. Since I reached this city I have talagraphed
    to friend Brown to send my thing to me, but I cannot hear a word
    from no one at all. I have written to Mr. Brown two or three
    times since I left the city. I trust that he has gotten my
    wife's letters, that is if she has written. Please direct your
    letters to me, near the corner Sarah and Edward street, until I
    give you further notice. You will tell friend B. how to direct
    his letters, as I forgotten it when I writt to him, and ask him
    if he has heard anything from Virginia. Please to let me hear
    from him without delay for my very soul is trubled about my
    friends whom I expected to of seen here before this hour.
    Whatever you do please to write. I shall look for you paper

    liberty and humanity.

    JOHN H. HILL.




THIRD LETTER.


_Canada is highly praised_--_The Vigilance Committee is implored to send
all the Fugitives there_--"_Farmers and Mechanics wanted_"--"_No living
in Canada for Negroes," as argued by_ "_Masters," flatly denied, &c.,
&c., &c._


    So I ask you to send the fugitives to Canada. I don't know much
    of this Province but I beleaves that there is Rome enough for
    the colored and whites of the United States. We wants farmers
    mechanic men of all qualification &c., if they are not made we
    will make them, if we cannot make the old, we will make our
    children.

    Now concerning the city toronto this city is Beautiful and
    Prosperous Levele city. Great many wooden codages more than what
    should be but I am in hopes there will be more of the Brick and
    Stonn. But I am not done about your Republicanism. Our masters
    have told us that there was no living in Canada for a Negro but
    if it may Please your gentlemanship to publish these facts that
    we are here able to earn our bread and money enough to make us
    comftable. But I say give me freedom, and the United States may
    have all her money and her Luxtures, yeas give Liberty or Death.
    I'm in America, but not under Such a Government that I cannot
    express myself, speak, think or write So as I am able, and if my
    master had allowed me to have an education I would make them
    American Slave-holders feel me, Yeas I would make them tremble
    when I spoke, and when I take my Pen in hand their knees smote
    together. My Dear Sir suppose I was an educated man. I could
    write you something worth reading, but you know we poor
    fugitives whom has just come over from the South are not able to
    write much on no subject whatever, but I hope by the aid of my
    God I will try to use my midnight lamp, untel I can have some
    influence upon the American Slavery. If some one would say to
    me, that they would give my wife bread untel I could be Educated
    I would stoop my trade this day and take up my books.

    But a crisis is approaching when assential requisite to the
    American Slaveholders when blood Death or Liberty will be
    required at their hands. I think our people have depened too
    long and too much on false legislator let us now look for
    ourselves. It is true that England however the Englishman is our
    best friend but we as men ought not to depened upon her
    Remonstrace with the Americans because she loves her commercial
    trade as any Nations do. But I must say, while we look up and
    acknowledge the Power greatness and honor of old England, and
    believe that while we sit beneath the Silken folds of her flag
    of Perfect Liberty, we are secure, beyond the reach of the
    aggressions of the Blood hounds and free from the despotism that
    would wrap around our limbs by the damable Slaveholder. Yet we
    would not like spoiled childeren depend upon her, but upon
    ourselves and as one means of strengthening ourselves, we should
    agitate the emigration to Canada. I here send you a paragraph
    which I clipted from the weekly Glob. I hope you will publish so
    that Mr. Williamson may know that men are not chattel here but
    reather they are men and if he wants his chattle let him come
    here after it or his thing. I wants you to let the whole United
    States know we are satisfied here because I have seen more
    Pleasure since I came here then I saw in the U.S. the 24 years
    that I served my master. Come Poor distress men women and come

    seen to come out an infame house.

    general way of doing your business, the money are all right I
    only had to pay a 6d on the Ten dollars. this money was given to
    by a friend in the city N. york, the friend was from Richmond
    Virginia (a white man) the amount was fifteen dollars, I forward
    a letter to you yesterday which letter I forgot to date. my
    friend I wants to hear from virginia the worst of all things.
    you know that we expect some freneds on and we cannot hear any
    thing from them which makes us uneasy for fear that they have
    attempt to come away and been detected. I have ears open at all
    times, listen at all hours expecting to hear from them Please to
    see friend Brown and know from him if he has heard anything from
    our friends, if he have not. tell him write and inquiare into

    was not what they thought them to be and if the slave-holders
    know when they are doing well they had better keep their side
    for if they comes over this side of the lake I am under the
    impression they will not go back with somethin that their mother
    boned them with whether thiar slaves written for them or not. I
    know some one here that have written his master to come after
    him, but not because he expect to go with him home but because
    he wants to retaleate upon his persecutor, but I would be sorry
    for man that have written for his master expecting to return
    with him because the people here would kill them. Sir I cannot
    write enough to express myself so I must close by saying I
    Remain yours.

    TORONTO, January 7th, 1855.

    MY DEAR FRIEND:--It is with much pleasure that I take this
    opportunity of addressing you with these few lines hoping when
    they reeches you they may find yourself and family enjoying good
    health as they leaves us at present.

    And it is with much happiness that I can say to you that Mrs.
    Mercer arrived in this city on yesterday. Mr. Mercer was at my
    house late in the evening, and I told him that when he went home
    if hear anything from Virginia, that he must let me know as soon
    as possible. He told me that if he went home and found any news
    there he would come right back and inform me thereof. But little
    did he expect to find his dearest there. You may judge what a
    meeting there was with them, and may God grant that there may be
    some more meetings with our wives and friends. I had been
    looking for some one from the old sod for several days, but I
    was in good hopes that it would be my poor Uncle. But poor
    fellow he are yet groaning under the sufferings of a horrid
    sytam, Expecting every day to Receive his Doom. Oh, God, what
    shall I do, or what can I do for him? I have prayed for him more
    than 12 months, yet he is in that horrid condition. I can never
    hear anything Directly from him or any of my people.

    Once more I appeal to your Humanity. Will you act for him, as if
    you was in slavery yourself, and I sincerely believe that he
    will come out of that condition? Mrs. M. have told me that she
    given some directions how he could be goten at, but friend
    Still, if this conductor should not be successfull this time,
    will you mind him of the Poor Slave again. I hope you will as
    Mrs. Mercer have told the friend what to do I cannot do more,
    therefore I must leve it to the Mercy of God and your Exertion.

    The weather have been very mile Ever since the 23rd of Dec. I
    have thought considerable about our condition in this country
    Seeing that the weather was so very faverable to us. I was
    thinking a few days ago, that nature had giving us A country &
    adopted all things Sutable.

    You will do me the kindness of telling me in your next whether
    or not the ten slaves have been Brought out from N.C.

    I have not hard from Brown for Nine month he have done some very
    Bad letting me alone, for what cause I cannot tell. Give my Best
    Respect to Mr. B. when you see him. I wish very much to hear
    from himself and family. You will please to let me hear from
    you. My wife Joines me in love to yourself and family.

    Yours most Respectfully,

    being arrested. At this day four years ago I left Petersburg for
    Richmond to meet the man whom called himself my master, but he
    wanted money worser that day than I do this day, he took me to
    sell me, he could not have done a better thing for me for I
    intended to leave any how by the first convaiance. I hard some
    good Prayers put up for the suffers on last Sunday evening in
    the Baptist Church. Now friend still I beleve that Prayers
    affects great good, but I beleve that the fire and sword would
    affect more good in this case. Perhaps this is not your
    thoughts, but I must acknowledge this to be my Polacy. The world
    are being turned upside down, and I think we might as well take
    an active part in it as not. We must have something to do as
    other people, and I hope this moment among the Slaves are the
    beginning. I wants to see something go on while I live.

THE ESCAPE OF HEZEKIAH HILL.


(UNCLE OF JOHN HENRY HILL.)


Impelled by the love of freedom Hezekiah resolved that he would work no
longer for nothing; that he would never be sold on the auction block:
that he no longer would obey the bidding of a master, and that he would
die rather than be a slave. This decision, however, had only been
entertained by him a short time prior to his escape. For a number of
years Hezekiah had been laboring under the pleasing thought that he
should succeed in obtaining freedom through purchase, having had an
understanding with his owner with this object in view. At different
times he had paid on account for himself nineteen hundred dollars, six
hundred dollars more than he was to have paid according to the first
agreement. Although so shamefully defrauded in the first instance, he
concluded to bear the disappointment as patiently as possible and get
out of the lion's mouth as best he could.

He continued to work on and save his money until he had actually come
within one hundred dollars of paying two thousand. At this point instead
of getting his free papers, as he firmly believed that he should, to his
surprise one day he saw a notorious trader approaching the shop where he
was at work. The errand of the trader was soon made known. Hezekiah
simply requested time to go back to the other end of the shop to get his
coat, which he seized and ran. He was pursued but not captured. This
occurrence took place in Petersburg, Va., about the first of December,
1854. On the night of the same day of his escape from the trader,
Hezekiah walked to Richmond and was there secreted under a floor by a
friend. He was a tall man, of powerful muscular strength, about thirty
years of age just in the prime of his manhood with enough pluck for two
men.

A heavy reward was offered for him, but the hunters failed to find him
in this hiding-place under the floor. He strongly hoped to get away
soon; on several occasions he made efforts, but only to be disappointed.
At different times at least two captains had consented to afford him a
private passage to Philadelphia, but like the impotent man at the pool,
some one always got ahead of him. Two or three times he even managed to
reach the boat upon the river, but had to return to his horrible place
under the floor. Some were under the impression that he was an
exceedingly unlucky man, and for a time captains feared to bring him.
But his courage sustained him unwaveringly.

Finally at the expiration of thirteen months, a private passage was
procured for him on the steamship Pennsylvania, and with a little slave
boy, seven years of age, (the son of the man who had secreted him)
though placed in a very hard berth, he came safely to Philadelphia,
greatly to the astonishment of the Vigilance Committee, who had waited
for him so long that they had despaired of his ever coming.

The joy that filled Hezekiah's bosom may be imagined but never
described. None but one who had been in similar straits could enter into
his feelings.

He had left his wife Louisa, and two little boys, Henry and Manuel. His
passage cost one hundred dollars.

Hezekiah being a noted character, a number of the true friends were
invited to take him by the hand and to rejoice with him over his noble
struggles and his triumph; needing rest and recruiting, he was made
welcome to stay, at the expense of the committee, as long as he might
feel disposed so to do. He remained several days, and then went on to
Canada rejoicing. After arriving there he returned his acknowledgment
for favors received, &c., in the following letter:


    TORONTO Jan 24th 1856.

    MR. STILL:--this is to inform you that Myself and little boy,
    arrived safely in this city this day the 24th, at ten o'clock
    after a very long and pleasant trip. I had a great deal of
    attention paid to me while on the way.

    I owes a great deel of thanks to yourself and friends. I will

    sick and could not be attended to there. However, I have arrived
    alright.

JAMES--(BROTHER OF JOHN HENRY HILL).


For three years James suffered in a place of concealment, before he
found the way opened to escape. When he resolved on having his freedom
he was much under twenty-one years of age, a brave young man, for three
years, with unfailing spirit, making resistance in the city of Richmond
to the slave Power!

Such heroes in the days of Slavery, did much to make the infernal system
insecure, and to keep alive the spirit of freedom in liberty-loving
hearts the world over, wherever such deeds of noble daring were made
known. But of his heroism, but little can be reported here, from the
fact, that such accounts as were in the possession of the Committee,
were never transferred from the loose slips of paper on which they were
first written, to the regular record book. But an important letter from
the friend with whom he was secreted, written a short while before he
escaped (on a boat), gives some idea of his condition:


    RICHMOND, VA., February 16th, 1861.

    DEAR BROTHER STILL:--I received a message from brother Julius
    anderson, asking me to send the bundle on but I has no way to
    send it, I have been waiting and truly hopeing that you would
    make some arrangement with some person, and send for the parcel.
    I have no way to send it, and I cannot communicate the subject
    to a stranger there is a Way by the N.y. line, but they are all
    strangers to me, and of course I could not approach them With
    this subject for I would be indangered myself greatly. this
    business is left to you and to you alone to attend to in
    providing the way for me to send on the parcel, if you only make
    an arrangement with some person and let me know the said person
    and the article which they is to be sent on then I can send the
    parcel. unless you do make an arrangement with some person, and
    assure them that they will receive the funs for delivering the
    parcel this Business cannot be accomplished. it is in your power
    to try to make some provision for the article to be sent but it
    is not in my power to do so, the bundle has been on my hands now
    going on 3 years, and I have suffered a great deal of danger,
    and is still suffering the same. I have understood Sir that
    there were no difficul about the mone that you had it in your
    possession Ready for the bundle whenever it is delivered. But
    Sir as I have said I can do nothing now. Sir I ask you please
    through sympathy and feelings on my part & his try to provide a
    way for the bundle to be sent and relieve me of the danger in
    which I am in. you might succeed in making an arrangement with
    those on the New york Steamers for they dose such things but
    please let me know the man that the arrangement is made
    with--please give me an answer by the bearer.

    yours truly friend

    C.A.


At last, the long, dark night passed away, and this young slave safely
made his way to freedom, and proceeded to Boston, where he now resides.
While the Committee was looked to for aid in the deliverance of this
poor fellow, it was painful to feel that it was not in their power to
answer his prayers--not until after his escape, was it possible so to
do. But his escape to freedom gave them a satisfaction which no words
can well express. At present, John Henry Hill is a justice of the peace
in Petersburg. Hezekiah resides at West Point, and James in Boston,
rejoicing that all men are free in the United States, at last.

ARCHER BARLOW, ALIAS EMIT ROBINS.


This passenger arrived from Norfolk, Va. in 1853. For the last four
years previous to escaping, he had been under the yoke of Dr. George
Wilson. Archer declared that he had been "very badly treated" by the
Doctor, which he urged as his reason for leaving. True, the doctor had
been good enough to allow him to hire his time, for which he required
Archer to pay the moderate sum of $120 per annum. As Archer had been
"sickly" most of the time, during the last year, he complained that
there was "no reduction" in his hire on this account. Upon reflection,
therefore, Archer thought, if he had justice done him, he would be in
possession of this "one hundred and twenty" himself, and all his other
rights, instead of having to toil for another without pay; so he looked
seriously into the matter of master and slave, and pretty soon resolved,
that if others chose to make no effort to get away, for himself he would
never be contented, until he was free. When a slave reached this
decision, he was in a very hopeful state. He was near the Underground
Rail Road, and was sure to find it, sooner or later. At this thoughtful
period, Archer was thirty-one years of age, a man of medium size, and
belonged to the two leading branches of southern humanity, _i.e._, he
_was_ half white and half colored--a dark mulatto. His arrival in
Philadelphia, per one of the Richmond steamers, was greeted with joy by
the Vigilance Committee, who extended to him the usual aid and care, and
forwarded him on to freedom. For a number of years, he has been a
citizen of Boston.

SAMUEL BUSH, ALIAS WILLIAM OBLEBEE.


This "piece of property" fled in the fall of 1853. As a specimen of this
article of commerce, he evinced considerable intelligence. He was a man
of dark color, although not totally free from the admixture of the
"superior" southern blood in his veins; in stature, he was only
ordinary. For leaving, he gave the following reasons: "I found that I
was working for my master, for his advantage, and when I was sick, I had
to pay just as much as if I were well--$7 a month. But my master was
cross, and said that he intended to sell me--to do better by me another
year. Times grew worse and worse, constantly. I thought, as I had heard,
that if I could raise thirty dollars I could come away." He at once saw
the value of money. To his mind it meant liberty from that moment.
Thenceforth he decided to treasure up every dollar he could get hold of
until he could accumulate at least enough to get out of "Old Virginia."
He was a married man, and thought he had a wife and one child, but on
reflection, he found out that they did not actually belong to him, but
to a carpenter, by the name of Bailey. The man whom Samuel was compelled
to call master was named Hoyle.

The Committee's interview with Samuel was quite satisfactory, and they
cheerfully accorded to him brotherly kindness and material aid at the
same time.

JOHN SPENCER AND HIS SON WILLIAM, AND JAMES ALBERT.


These individuals escaped from the eastern shore of Maryland, in the
Spring of 1853, but were led to conclude that they could enjoy the
freedom they had aimed to find, in New Jersey. They procured employment
in the neighborhood of Haddonfield, some six or eight miles from Camden,
New Jersey, and were succeeding, as they thought, very well.

Things went on favorably for about three months, when to their alarm
"slave-hunters were discovered in the neighborhood," and sufficient
evidence was obtained to make it quite plain that, John, William and
James were the identical persons, for whom the hunters were in "hot
pursuit." When brought to the Committee, they were pretty thoroughly
alarmed and felt very anxious to be safely off to Canada. While the
Committee always rendered in such cases immediate protection and aid,
they nevertheless, felt, in view of the imminent dangers existing under
the fugitive slave law, that persons disposed to thus stop by the way,
should be very plainly given to understand, that if they were captured
they would have themselves the most to blame. But the dread of Slavery
was strong in the minds of these fugitives, and they very fully realized
their folly in stopping in New Jersey. The Committee procured their
tickets, helped them to disguise themselves as much as possible, and
admonished them not to stop short of Canada.

HETTY SCOTT ALIAS MARGARET DUNCANS AND DAUGHTER PRISCILLA.


This mother and daughter had been the "chattels personal" of Daniel
Coolby of Harvard, Md. Their lot had been that of ordinary slaves in the
country, on farms, &c. The motive which prompted them to escape was the
fact that their master had "threatened to sell" them. He had a right to
do so; but Hetty was a little squeamish on this point and took great
umbrage at her "kind master." In this "disobedient" state of mind, she
determined, if hard struggling would enable her, to defeat the threats
of Mr. Daniel Coolby, that he should not much longer have the
satisfaction of enjoying the fruit of the toil of herself and offspring.
She at once began to prepare for her journey.

She had three children of her own to bring, besides she was intimately
acquainted with a young man and a young woman, both slaves, to whom she
felt that it would be safe to confide her plans with a view of inviting
them to accompany her. The young couple were ready converts to the
eloquent speech delivered to them by Hetty on Freedom, and were quite
willing to accept her as their leader in the emergency. Up to the hour
of setting out on their lonely and fatiguing journey, arrangements were
being carefully completed, so that there should be no delay of any kind.
At the appointed hour they were all moving northward in good order.

Arriving at Quakertown, Pa., they found friends of the slave, who
welcomed them to their homes and sympathy, gladdening the hearts of all
concerned. For prudential reasons it was deemed desirable to separate
the party, to send some one way and some another. Thus safely, through
the kind offices and aid of the friends at Quakertown, they were duly
forwarded on to the Committee in Philadelphia. Here similar acts of
charity were extended to them, and they were directed on to Canada.

ROBERT FISHER.


THIS PASSENGER AVAILS HIMSELF OF HOLIDAY WEEK, BETWEEN CHRISTMAS AND NEW
YEAR'S, TO MAKE HIS NORTHERN TRIP. Robert was about thirty years of age,
dark color, quite tall, and in talking with him a little while, it was
soon discovered that Slavery had not crushed all the brains out of his
head by a good deal. Nor was he so much attached to his "kind-hearted
master," John Edward Jackson, of Anne Arundel, Md., or his old fiddle,
that he was contented and happy while in bondage. Far from it. The fact
was, that he hated Slavery so decidedly and had such a clear common
sense-like view of the evils and misery of the system, that he declared
he had as a matter of principle refrained from marrying, in order that
he might have no reason to grieve over having added to the woes of
slaves. Nor did he wish to be encumbered, if the opportunity offered to
escape. According to law he was entitled to his freedom at the age of
twenty-five.

But what right had a negro, which white slave-holders were "bound to
respect?" Many who had been willed free, were held just as firmly in
Slavery, as if no will had ever been made. Robert had too much sense to
suppose that he could gain anything by seeking legal redress. This
method, therefore, was considered out of the question. But in the
meantime he was growing very naturally in favor of the Underground Rail
Road. From his experience Robert did not hesitate to say that his master
was "mean," "a very hard man," who would work his servants early and
late, without allowing them food and clothing sufficient to shield them
from the cold and hunger. Robert certainly had unmistakable marks about
him, of having been used roughly. He thought very well of Nathan Harris,
a fellow-servant belonging to the same owner, and he made up his mind,
if Nathan would join him, neither the length of the journey, the
loneliness of night travel, the coldness of the weather, the fear of the
slave-hunter, nor the scantiness of their means should deter him from
making his way to freedom. Nathan listened to the proposal, and was
suddenly converted to freedom, and the two united during Christmas week,
1854, and set out on the Underground Rail Road. It is needless to say
that they had trying difficulties to encounter. These they expected, but
all were overcome, and they reached the Vigilance Committee, in
Philadelphia safely, and were cordially welcomed. During the interview,
a full interchange of thought resulted, the fugitives were well cared
for, and in due time both were forwarded on, free of cost.

HANSEL WAPLES.


This traveler arrived from Millsboro, Indian River, Delaware, where he
was owned by Wm. E. Burton. While Hansel did not really own himself, he
had the reputation of having a wife and six children. In June, some six
months prior to her husband's arrival, Hansel's wife had been allowed by
her mistress to go out on a begging expedition, to raise money to buy
herself; but contrary to the expectation of her mistress she never
returned. Doubtless the mistress looked upon this course as a piece of
the most highhanded stealing. Hansel did not speak of his owner as being
a hard man, but on the contrary he thought that he was about as "good"
as the best that he was acquainted with. While this was true, however,
Hansel had quite good ground for believing that his master was about to
sell him. Dreading this fate he made up his mind to go in pursuit of his
wife to a Free state. Exactly where to look or how to find her he could
not tell.

The Committee advised him to "search in Canada." And in order to enable
him to get on quickly and safely, the Committee aided him with money,
&c., in 1853.

MARY ENNIS ALIAS LICIA HEMMIN.


Mary arrived with her two children in the early Spring of 1854.

The mother was a woman of about thirty-three years of age, quite tall,
with a countenance and general appearance well fitted to awaken sympathy
at first sight. Her oldest child was a little girl seven years of age,
named Lydia; the other was named Louisa Caroline, three years of age,
both promising in appearance. They were the so called property of John
Ennis, of Georgetown, Delaware. For their flight they chose the dead of
Winter. After leaving they made their way to West Chester, and there
found friends and security for several weeks, up to the time they
reached Philadelphia. Probably the friends with whom they stopped
thought the weather too inclement for a woman with children dependent on
her support to travel. Long before this mother escaped, thoughts of
liberty filled her heart. She was ever watching for an opportunity, that
would encourage her to hope for safety, when once the attempt should be
made. Until, however, she was convinced that her two children were to be
sold, she could not quite muster courage to set out on the journey. This
threat to sell proved in multitudes of instances, "the last straw on the
camel's back." When nothing else would start them this would. Mary and
her children were the only slaves owned by this Ennis, consequently her
duties were that of "Jack of all trades;" sometimes in the field and
sometimes in the barn, as well as in the kitchen, by which, it is
needless to say, that her life was rendered servile to the last degree.

To bind up the broken heart of such a poor slave mother, and to aid such
tender plants as were these little girls, from such a wretched state of
barbarism as existed in poor little Delaware, was doubly gratifying to
the Committee.

These passengers reached the Philadelphia station, about the 24th of
September, 1856, five days after they escaped from Carroll county. They
were in fine spirits, and had borne the fatigue and privation of travel
bravely. A free and interesting interview took place, between these
passengers and the Committee, eliciting much information, especially
with regard to the workings of the system on the farms, from which they
had the good luck to flee. Each of the party was thoroughly questioned,
about how time had passed with them at home, or rather in the prison
house, what kind of men their masters were, how they fed and clothed, if
they whipped, bought or sold, whether they were members of church, or
not, and many more questions needless to enumerate bearing on the
domestic relation which had existed between themselves and their
masters. These queries they answered in their own way, with
intelligence. Upon the whole, their lot in Slavery had been rather more
favorable than the average run of slaves.

No record was made of any very severe treatment. In fact, the notices
made of them were very brief, and, but for the elaborate way in which
they were described in the "Baltimore Sun," by their owners, their
narratives would hardly be considered of sufficient interest to record.
The heavy rewards, beautiful descriptions, and elegant illustrations in
the "Sun," were very attractive reading. The Vigilance Committee took
the "Sun," for nothing else under the sun but for this special
literature, and for this purpose they always considered the "Sun" a
cheap and reliable paper.

A slave man or woman, running for life, he with a bundle on his back or
she with a babe in her arms, was always a very interesting sight, and
should always be held in remembrance. Likewise the descriptions given by
slave-holders, as a general rule, showed considerable artistic powers
and a most thorough knowledge of the physical outlines of this peculiar
property. Indeed, the art must have been studied attentively for
practical purposes. When the advertisements were received in advance of
arrivals, which was always the case, the descriptions generally were
found so lifelike, that the Committee preferred to take them in
preference to putting themselves to the labor of writing out new ones,
for future reference. This we think, ought not to be complained of by
any who were so unfortunate as to lose wayward servants, as it is but
fair to give credit to all concerned. True, sometimes some of these
beautiful advertisements were open to gentle criticism. The one at the
head of this report, is clearly of this character. For instance, in
describing Isaac, Mr. Thomas B. Owings, represents him as being of a
"very light color," "almost yellow," "might be called a yellow boy." In
the next breath he has no perceptible marks. Now, if he is "very light,"
that is a well-known southern mark, admitted everywhere. A hint to the
wise is sufficient. However, judging from what was seen of Isaac in
Philadelphia, there was more cunning than "foolishness" about him.
Slaves sometimes, when wanting to get away, would make their owners
believe that they were very happy and contented. And, in using this kind
of foolishness, would keep up appearances until an opportunity offered
for an escape. So Isaac might have possessed this sagacity, which
appeared like nonsense to his master. That slave-holders, above all
others, were in the habit of taking special pains to encourage
foolishness, loud laughing, banjo playing, low dancing, etc., in the
place of education, virtue, self-respect and manly carriage,
slave-holders themselves are witnesses.

As Mr. Robert Dade was also a loser, equally with Mr. Thomas B. Owings,
and as his advertisement was of the same liberality and high tone, it
seems but fitting that it should come in just here, to give weight and
completeness to the story. Both Owings and Dade showed a considerable
degree of southern chivalry in the liberality of their rewards.
Doubtless, the large sums thus offered awakened a lively feeling in the
breasts of old slave-hunters. But it is to be supposed that the artful
fugitives safely reached Philadelphia before the hunters got even the
first scent on their track. Up to the present hour, with the owners all
may be profound mystery; if so, it is to be hoped, that they may feel
some interest in the solution of these wonders. The articles so
accurately described must now be permitted to testify in their own
words, as taken from the records.

Green Modock acknowledges that he was owned by William Dorsey, Perry by
Robert Dade, Sam and Isaac by Thomas Owings, all farmers, and all
"tough" and "pretty mean men." Sam and Isaac had other names with them,
but not such a variety of clothing as their master might have supposed.
Sam said he left because his master threatened to sell him to Georgia,
and he believed that he meant so to do, as he had sold all his brothers
and sisters to Georgia some time before he escaped.

But this was not all. Sam declared his master had threatened to shoot
him a short while before he left. This was the last straw on the camel's
back. Sam's heart was in Canada ever after that. In traveling he
resolved that nothing should stop him. Charles offered the same excuse
as did Sam. He had been threatened with the auction-block. He left his
mother free, but four sisters he left in chains. As these men spoke of
their tough owners and bad treatment in Slavery, they expressed their
indignation at the idea that Owings, Dade and Dorsey had dared to rob
them of their God-given rights. They were only ignorant farm hands. As
they drank in the free air, the thought of their wrongs aroused all
their manhood. They were all young men, hale and stout, with strong
resolutions to make Canada their future home. The Committee encouraged
them in this, and aided them for humanity's sake.--Mr. Robert Dade's
advertisement speaks for itself as follows:


    RAN AWAY--On Saturday night, 20th inst., from the subscriber,
    living near Mount Airy P.O., Carroll county, two Negro men,
    PERRY and CHARLES. Perry is quite dark, full face; is about 5
    feet 8 or 9 inches high; has a scar on one of his hands, and one
    on his legs, caused by a cut from a scythe; 25 years old.
    Charles is of a copper color, about 5 feet 9 or 10 inches high;
    round shouldered, with small whiskers; has one crooked finger
    that he cannot straighten, and a scar on his right leg, caused
    by the cut of a scythe; 22 years old. I will give two hundred
    and fifty dollars each, if taken in the State and returned to
    me, or secured in some jail so that I can get them again, or a
    $1,000 for the two, or $500 each, if taken out of the State, and
    secured in some jail in this State so that I can get them again.

WILLIAM B. WHITE, SUSAN BROOKS AND WILLIAM HENRY ATKINS.--STOWED AWAY IN
THE STEAMSHIP CITY OF RICHMOND.


But for their hope of liberty, their uncomfortable position could hardly
have been endured by these fugitives. William had been compelled to dig
and delve, to earn bread and butter, clothing and luxuries, houses and
land, education and ease for H.B. Dickinson, of Richmond. William
smarted frequently; but what could he do? Complaint from a slave was a
crime of the deepest dye. So William dug away mutely, but continued to
think, nevertheless. He was a man of about thirty-six years of age, of
dark chestnut color, medium size, and of pleasant manners to say the
least. His owner was a tobacco manufacturer, who held some thirty slaves
in his own right, besides hiring a great many others. William was
regularly employed by day in his master's tobacco factory. He was
likewise employed, as one of the carriers of the Richmond Dispatch; the
time allotted to fill the duties of this office, was however, before
sunrise in the morning. It is but just to state, in favor of his master,
that William was himself the receiver of a part of the pay for this
night work. It was by this means William procured clothing and certain
other necessaries.

From William's report of his master, he was by no means among the worst
of slave-holders in Richmond; he did not himself flog, but the overseer
was allowed to conduct this business, when it was considered necessary.
For a long time William had cherished a strong desire to be free, and
had gone so far on several occasions as to make unsuccessful attempts to
accomplish this end. At last he was only apprised of his opportunity to
carry his wishes into practice a few moments before the hour for the
starting of the Underground Rail Road train.

Being on the watch, he hailed the privilege, and left without looking
back.

True he left his wife and two children, who were free, and a son also
who was owned by Warner Toliver, of Gloucester county, Va. We leave the
reader to decide for himself, whether William did right or wrong, and
who was responsible for the sorrow of both husband and wife caused by
the husband's course. The Committee received him as a true and honest
friend of freedom, and as such aided him.

SUSAN BROOKS.


Susan was also a passenger on the same ship that brought Wm. B. White.
She was from Norfolk. Her toil, body and strength were claimed by Thomas
Eckels, Esq., a man of wealth and likewise a man of intemperance. With
those who regarded Slavery as a "divine institution," intemperance was
scarcely a mote, in the eyes of such. For sixteen years, Susan had been
in the habit of hiring her time, for which she was required to pay five
dollars per month. As she had the reputation of being a good cook and
chambermaid, she was employed steadily, sometimes on boats. This sum may
therefore be considered reasonable.

Owing to the death of her husband, about a year previous to her escape,
she had suffered greatly, so much so, that on two or three occasions,
she had fallen into alarming fits,--a fact by no means agreeable to her
owner, as he feared that the traders on learning her failing health
would underrate her on this account. But Susan was rather thankful for
these signs of weakness, as she was thereby enabled to mature her plans
and thus to elude detection.

Her son having gone on ahead to Canada about six months in advance of
her, she felt that she had strong ties in the goodly land. Every day she
remained in bondage, the cords bound her more tightly, and "weeks seemed
like months, and months like years," so abhorrent had the peculiar
institution become to her in every particular. In this state of mind,
she saw no other way, than by submitting to be secreted, until an
opportunity should offer, via the Underground Rail Road.

So for four months, like a true and earnest woman, she endured a great
"fight of affliction," in this horrible place. But the thought of
freedom enabled her to keep her courage up, until the glad news was
conveyed to her that all things were ready, providing that she could get
safely to the boat, on which she was to be secreted. How she succeeded
in so doing the record book fails to explain.

One of the methods, which used to succeed very well, in skillful and
brave hands, was this: In order to avoid suspicion, the woman intending
to be secreted, approached the boat with a clean ironed shirt on her
arm, bare headed and in her usual working dress, looking good-natured of
course, and as if she were simply conveying the shirt to one of the men
on the boat. The attention of the officer on the watch would not for a
moment be attracted by a custom so common as this. Thus safely on the
boat, the man whose business it was to put this piece of property in the
most safe Underground Rail Road place, if he saw that every thing looked
favorable, would quickly arrange matters without being missed from his
duties. In numerous instances, officers were outwitted in this way.

As to what Susan had seen in the way of hardships, whether in relation
to herself or others, her story was most interesting; but it may here be
passed in order to make room for others. She left one sister, named Mary
Ann Tharagood, who was wanting to come away very much. Susan was a woman
of dark color, round built, medium height, and about forty years of age
when she escaped in 1854.

WILLIAM HENRY ATKINS.


William Henry was also a fellow-passenger on the same boat with William
B. White and Susan Cooke. These might be set down, as first-class
Underground Rail Road travelers.

Henry was a very likely-looking article. He was quite smart, about six
feet high, a dark mulatto, and was owned by a Baptist minister.

For some cause not stated on the books, not long before leaving, Henry
had received a notice from his owner, (the Baptist Minister) that he
might hunt himself a new master as soon as possible. This was a business
that Henry had no relish for. The owner he already had, he concluded bad
enough in all conscience, and it did not occur to him that hunting
another would mend the matter much. So in thinking over the situation,
he was "taken sick." He felt the need of a little time to reflect upon
matters of very weighty moment involving his freedom. So when he was
called upon one day to go to his regular toil, the answer was, "I am
sick, I am not able to budge hardly." The excuse took and Henry attended
faithfully to his "sick business," for the time being, while on the
other hand, the Baptist Minister waited patiently all the while for
William to get well enough for hunting a new master. What had to be
done, needed to be done quickly, before his master's patience was
exhausted. William soon had matters arranged for traveling North. He had
a wife, Eliza, for whom he felt the greatest affection; but as he viewed
matters at that time, he concluded that he could really do more for her
in Canada than he could in Norfolk. He saw no chance, either under the
Baptist minister, or under a new master. His wife was owned by Susan
Langely. When the hour arrived to start, as brave men usually do, Henry,
having counted all the cost, was in his place on the boat with his face
towards Canada.

How he looked at matters on John Bull's side of the house, letters from
Henry will abundantly reveal as follows:

FOUR ARRIVALS.


CHARLOTTE AND HARRIET ESCAPE IN DEEP MOURNING--MASTER IN THE SAME CAR
HUNTING FOR THEM, SEES THEM, BUT DOES NOT KNOW THEM--WHITE LADY AND
CHILD WITH A COLORED COACHMAN, TRAVELING--AT CHAMBERSBUEG AT A HOTEL,
THE PROPRIETOR DETECTS THEM AS U.G.R.R. PASSENGERS--THREE "LIKELY" YOUNG
MEN FROM BALTIMORE--"FOUR LARGE AND TWO SMALL HAMS"--POLICE OFFICES
IMPARTING INFORMATION AT THE ANTI-SLAVERY OFFICE--U.G.R.R. PASSENGERS
TRAVELING WITH THEIR MASTERS' HORSES AND CARRIAGES--"BREAK
DOWN"--CONFLICT WITH WHITE MEN--SIX PASSENGERS RIDING TWO HORSES, &c.
About the 31st of May, 1856, an exceedingly anxious state of feeling
existed with the active Committee in Philadelphia. In the course of
twenty-four hours four arrivals had come to hand from different
localities. The circumstances connected with the escape of each party,
being so unusual, there was scarcely ground for any other conclusion
than that disaster was imminent, if not impossible to be averted.

It was a day long to be remembered. Aside from the danger, however, a
more encouraging hour had never presented itself in the history of the
Road. The courage, which had so often been shown in the face of great
danger, satisfied the Committee that there were heroes and heroines
among these passengers, fully entitled to the applause of the
liberty-loving citizens of Brotherly Love. The very idea of having to
walk for days and nights in succession, over strange roads, through
by-ways, and valleys, over mountains, and marshes, was fitted to appal
the bravest hearts, especially where women and children were concerned.

Being familiar with such cases, the Committee was delighted beyond
measure to observe how wisely and successfully each of these parties had
managed to overcome these difficulties.



[Illustration: ]



Party No. 1 consisted of Charlotte Giles and Harriet Eglin, owned by
Capt. Wm. Applegarth and John Delahay. Neither of these girls had any
great complaint to make on the score of ill-treatment endured.

So they contrived each to get a suit of mourning, with heavy black
veils, and thus dressed, apparently absorbed with grief, with a friend
to pass them to the Baltimore depot (hard place to pass, except aided by
an individual well known to the R.R. company), they took a direct course
for Philadelphia.

While seated in the car, before leaving Baltimore (where slaves and
masters both belonged), who should enter but the master of one of the
girls! In a very excited manner, he hurriedly approached Charlotte and
Harriet, who were apparently weeping. Peeping under their veils, "What
is your name," exclaimed the excited gentleman. "Mary, sir," sobbed
Charlotte. "What is your name?" (to the other mourner) "Lizzie, sir,"
was the faint reply. On rushed the excited gentleman as if moved by
steam--through the cars, looking for his property; not finding it, he
passed out of the cars, and to the delight of Charlotte and Harriet soon
disappeared. Fair business men would be likely to look at this conduct
on the part of the two girls in the light of a "sharp practice." In
military parlance it might be regarded as excellent strategy. Be this as
it may, the Underground Rail Road passengers arrived safely at the
Philadelphia station and were gladly received.

A brief stay in the city was thought prudent lest the hunters might be
on the pursuit. They were, therefore, retained in safe quarters.



In the meantime, Arrival No. 2 reached the Committee. It consisted of a
colored man, a white woman and a child, ten years old. This case created
no little surprise. Not that quite a number of passengers, fair enough
to pass for white, with just a slight tinge of colored blood in their
veins, even sons and daughters of some of the F.F.V., had not on various
occasions come over the U.G.R.R. But this party was peculiar. An
explanation was sought, which resulted in ascertaining that the party
was from Leesburg, Virginia; that David, the colored man, was about
twenty-seven years of age, intelligent, and was owned, or claimed by
Joshua Pusey. David had no taste for Slavery, indeed, felt that it would
be impossible for him to adapt himself to a life of servitude for the
special benefit of others; he had, already, as he thought, been dealt
with very wrongfully by Pusey, who had deprived him of many years of the
best part of his life, and would continue thus to wrong him, if he did
not make a resolute effort to get away. So after thinking of various
plans, he determined not to run off as a slave with his "budget on his
back," but to "travel as a coachman," under the "protection of a white
lady." In planning this pleasant scheme, David was not blind to the fact
that neither himself nor the "white lady," with whom he proposed to
travel, possessed either horse or carriage.

But his master happened to have a vehicle that would answer for the
occasion. David reasoned that as Joshua, his so called master, had
deprived him of his just dues for so many years, he had a right to
borrow, or take without borrowing, one of Joshua's horses for the
expedition. The plan was submitted to the lady, and was approved, and a
mutual understanding here entered into, that she should hire a carriage,
and take also her little girl with them. The lady was to assume the
proprietorship of the horse, carriage and coachman. In so doing all
dangers would be, in their judgment, averted. The scheme being all ready
for execution, the time for departure was fixed, the carriage hired,
David having secured his master Joshua's horse, and off they started in
the direction of Pennsylvania. White people being so accustomed to
riding, and colored people to driving, the party looked all right. No
one suspected them, that they were aware of, while passing through
Virginia.

[Illustration: ]

On reaching Chambersburg, Pa., in the evening, they drove to a hotel,
the lady alighted, holding by the hand her well dressed and nice-looking
little daughter, bearing herself with as independent an air as if she
had owned twenty such boys as accompanied her as coachman. She did not
hesitate to enter and request accommodations for the night, for herself,
daughter, coachman, and horse. Being politely told that they could be
accommodated, all that was necessary was, that the lady should show off
to the best advantage possible. The same duty also rested with weight
upon the mind of David.

The night passed safely and the morning was ushered in with bright hopes
which were overcast but only for a moment, however. Breakfast having
been ordered and partaken of, to the lady's surprise, just as she was in
the act of paying the bill, the proprietor of the hotel intimated that
he thought that matters "looked a little suspicious," in other words, he
said plainly, that he "believed that it was an Underground Rail Road
movement;" but being an obliging hotel-keeper, he assured her at the
same time, that he "would not betray them." Just here it was with them
as it would have been on any other rail road when things threaten to
come to a stand; they could do nothing more than make their way out of
the peril as best they could. One thing they decided to do immediately,
namely, to "leave the horse and carriage," and try other modes of
travel. They concluded to take the regular passenger cars. In this way
they reached Philadelphia. In Harrisburg, they had sought and received
instructions how to find the Committee in Philadelphia.

What relations had previously existed between David and this lady in
Virginia, the Committee knew not. It looked more like the time spoken of
in Isaiah, where it is said, "And a little child shall lead them," than
any thing that had ever been previously witnessed on the Underground
Rail Road. The Underground Rail Road never practised the proscription
governing other roads, on account of race, color, or previous condition.
All were welcome to its immunities, white or colored, when the object to
be gained favored freedom, or weakened Slavery. As the sole aim apparent
in this case was freedom for the slave the Committee received these
travellers as Underground Rail Road passengers.



Arrival No. 3. Charles H. Ringold, Robert Smith, and John Henry
Richards, all from Baltimore. Their ages ranged from twenty to
twenty-four years. They were in appearance of the class most inviting to
men who were in the business of buying and selling slaves. Charles and
John were owned by James Hodges, and Robert by Wm. H. Normis, living in
Baltimore. This is all that the records contain of them. The exciting
and hurrying times when they were in charge of the Committee probably
forbade the writing out of a more detailed account of them, as was often
the case.

With the above three arrivals on hand, it may be seen how great was the
danger to which all concerned were exposed on account of the bold and
open manner in which these parties had escaped from the land of the
peculiar institution. Notwithstanding, a feeling of very great
gratification existed in view of the success attending the new and
adventurous modes of traveling. Indulging in reflections of this sort,
the writer on going from his dinner that day to the anti-slavery office,
to his surprise found an officer awaiting his coming. Said officer was
of the mayor's police force. Before many moments had been allowed to
pass, in which to conjecture his errand, the officer, evidently burdened
with the importance of his mission, began to state his business
substantially as follows:

"I have just received a telegraphic despatch from a slave-holder living
in Maryland, informing me that six slaves had escaped from him, and that
he had reason to believe that they were on their way to Philadelphia,
and would come in the regular train direct from Harrisburg; furthermore
I am requested to be at the depot on the arrival of the train to arrest
the whole party, for whom a reward of $1300 is offered. Now I am not the
man for this business. I would have nothing to do with the contemptible
work of arresting fugitives. I'd rather help them off. What I am telling
you is confidential. My object in coming to the office is simply to
notify the Vigilance Committee so that they may be on the look-out for
them at the depot this evening and get them out of danger as soon as
possible. This is the way I feel about them; but I shall telegraph back
that I will be on the look-out."

While the officer was giving this information he was listened to most
attentively, and every word he uttered was carefully weighed. An air of
truthfulness, however, was apparent; nevertheless he was a stranger and
there was cause for great cautiousness. During the interview an unopened
telegraphic despatch which had come to hand during the writer's absence,
lay on the desk. Impressed with the belief that it might shed light on
the officer's story, the first opportunity that offered, it was seized,
opened, and it read as follows: (Copied from the original.)




    HARRISBURG, May 31st, 1856.

    WM. STILL, N. 5th St.:--I have sent via at two o'clock four
    large and two small hams.

    JOS. C. BUSTILL.


Here there was no room for further doubt, but much need for vigilance.
Although the despatch was not read to the officer, not that his story
was doubted, but purely for prudential reasons, he was nevertheless
given to understand, that it was about the same party, and that they
would be duly looked after. It would hardly have been understood by the
officer, had he been permitted to read it so guardedly was it worded, it
was indeed dead language to all save the initiated. In one particular
especially, relative to the depot where they were expected to arrive,
the officer was in the dark, as his despatch pointed to the regular
train, and of course to the depot at Eleventh and Market streets. The
Underground Rail Road despatch on the contrary pointed to Broad and
Callowhill streets "Via," _i.e._ Reading.

As notified, that evening the "four large and two small hams" arrived,
and turned out to be of the very finest quality, just such as any trader
would have paid the highest market price for. Being mindful of the great
danger of the hour, there was felt to be more occasion just then for
anxiety and watchfulness, than for cheering and hurrahing over the brave
passengers. To provide for them in the usual manner, in view of the
threatening aspect of affairs, could not be thought of. In this critical
hour it devolved upon a member of the Committee, for the safety of all
parties, to find new and separate places of accommodation, especially
for the six known to be pursued. To be stored in other than private
families would not answer. Three or four such were visited at once;
after learning of the danger much sympathy was expressed, but one after
another made excuses and refused. This was painful, for the parties had
plenty of house room, were identified with the oppressed race, and on
public meeting occasions made loud professions of devotion to the cause
of the fugitive, &c. The memory of the hour and circumstances is still
fresh.

Accommodations were finally procured for a number of the fugitives with
a widow woman, (Ann Laws) whose opportunities for succor were far less
than at the places where refusals had been met with. But Mrs. L. was
kind-hearted, and nobly manifested a willingness to do all that she
could for their safety. Of course the Committee felt bound to bear
whatever expense might necessarily be incurred. Here some of the
passengers were kept for several days, strictly private, long enough to
give the slave-hunters full opportunity to tire themselves, and give up
the chase in despair. Some belonging to the former arrivals had also to
be similarly kept for the same reasons. Through careful management all
were succored and cared for. Whilst much interesting information was
obtained from these several arrivals: the incidents connected with their
lives in Slavery, and when escaping were but briefly written out. Of
this fourth arrival, however, the following intelligence will doubtless
be highly gratifying to the friends of freedom, wherever the labors of
the Underground Rail Road may be appreciated. The people round about
Hagerstown, Maryland, may like to know how these "articles" got off so
successfully, the circumstances of their escape having doubtless created
some excitement in that region of the country.

Arrival No. 4. Charles Bird, George Dorsey, Angeline Brown, Albert
Brown, Charles Brown and Jane Scott.

Charles was twenty-four years of age, quite dark, of quick motion, and
ready speech, and in every way appearing as though he could take care of
himself. He had occupied the condition of a farm laborer. This calling
he concluded to forsake, not because he disliked farming, but simply to
get rid of David Clargart, who professed to own him, and compelled him
to work without pay, "for nothing." While Charles spoke favorably of
Clargart as a man, to the extent, at all events, of testifying that he
was not what was called a hard man, nevertheless Charles was so
decidedly opposed to Slavery that he felt compelled to look out for
himself. Serving another man on the no pay principle, at the same time
liable to be flogged, and sold at the pleasure of another, Charles felt
was worse than heathenish viewed in any light whatsoever. He was
prepared therefore, to leave without delay. He had four sisters in the
hands of Clargart, but what could he do for them but leave them to
Providence.

The next on the list was George Dorsey, a comrade of Charles. He was a
young man, of medium size, mixed blood, intelligent, and a brave fellow
as will appear presently.

This party in order to get over the road as expeditiously as possible,
availed themselves of their master's horses and wagon and moved off
civilly and respectably. About nine miles from home on the road, a
couple of white men, finding their carriage broken down approached them,
unceremoniously seized the horses by the reins and were evidently about
to assume authority, supposing that the boys would surrender at once.
But instead of so doing, the boys struck away at them with all their
might, with their large clubs, not even waiting to hear what these
superior individuals wanted. The effect of the clubs brought them
prostrate in the road, in an attitude resembling two men dreaming, (it
was in the night.) The victorious passengers, seeing that the smashed up
carriage could be of no further use to them, quickly conceived the idea
of unhitching and attempting further pursuit on horseback. Each horse
was required to carry three passengers. So up they mounted and off they
galloped with the horses' heads turned directly towards Pennsylvania. No
further difficulty presented itself until after they had traveled some
forty miles. Here the poor horses broke down, and had to be abandoned.
The fugitives were hopeful, but of the difficulties ahead they wot not;
surely no flowery beds of ease awaited them. For one whole week they
were obliged to fare as they could, out in the woods, over the
mountains, &c. How they overcame the trials in this situation we cannot
undertake to describe. Suffice it to say, at the end of the time above
mentioned they managed to reach Harrisburg and found assistance as
already intimated.

[Illustration: ]

George and Angeline, (who was his sister) with her two boys had a
considerable amount of white blood in their veins, and belonged to a
wealthy man by the name of George Schaeffer, who was in the milling
business. They were of one mind in representing him as a hard man. "He
would often threaten to sell, and was very hard to please." George and
Angeline left their mother and ten brothers and sisters.

Jane was a well-grown girl, smart, and not bad-looking, with a fine
brown skin, and was also owned by Schaeffer.

Letters from the enterprising Charlotte and Harriet (arrival No. 1),
brought the gratifying intelligence, that they had found good homes in
Western New York, and valued their freedom highly. Three out of quite a
number of letters received from them from time to time are subjoined.


    SENNETT, June, 1856.

    MR. WILLIAM STILL:--_Dear Sir_:--I am happy to tell you that
    Charlotte Gildes and myself have got along thus far safely. We
    have had no trouble and found friends all the way along, for
    which we feel very thankful to you and to all our friends on the
    road since we left. We reached Mr. Loguen's in Syracuse, on last
    Tuesday evening & on Wednesday two gentlemen from this community
    called and we went with them to work in their families. What I
    wish you would do is to be so kind as to send our clothes to
    this place if they should fall into your hands. We hope our
    uncle in Baltimore will get the letter Charlotte wrote to him
    last Sabbath, while we were at your house, concerning the
    clothes. Perhaps the best would be to send them to Syracuse to
    the _care of Mr. Loguen_ and he will send them to us. This will
    more certainly ensure our getting them. If you hear anything
    that would be interesting to Charlotte or me from Baltimore,
    please direct a letter to us to this place, to the care of Revd.
    Chas. Anderson, Sennett, Cayuga Co., N.Y. Please give my love
    and Charlotte's to Mrs. Still and thank her for her kindness to
    us while at your house.

    Your affectionate friend,

    HARRIET EGLIN.




SECOND LETTER.



    SENNETT, July 31st, 1856.

    MR. WM. STILL:--_My Dear Friend_:--I have just received your
    note of 29th inst. and allow me dear sir, to assure you that the
    only letter I have written, is the one you received, an answer
    to which you sent me. I never wrote to Baltimore, nor did any
    person write for me there, and it is with _indescribable grief_,
    that I hear what your letter communicates to me, of those who
    you say have gotten into difficulty on my account. My Cousin
    Charlotte who came with me, got into a good place in this
    vicinity, but she could not content herself to stay here but
    just _one week_--she then went to Canada--and she is the one who
    by writing (if any one), has brought this trouble upon those to
    whom you refer in Baltimore.

    She has written me two letters from Canada, and by neither of
    them can I ascertain _where she lives_--her letters are mailed
    at Suspension Bridge, but she does not live there as her letters
    show. In the first she does not even sign her name. She has
    evidently employed some person to write, who is nearly as
    ignorant as herself. If I knew where to find her I would find
    out _what_ she has written.

    I don't know but she has told where I live, and may yet get me
    and my friends here, in trouble too, as she has some in other
    places. I don't wish to have you trouble yourself about my
    clothes, I am in a place where I can get all the clothes I want
    or need. Will you please write me when convenient and tell me
    what you hear about those who I fear are suffering as the result
    of their kindness to me? May God, in some way, grant them
    deliverance. Oh the misery, the sorrow, which this cursed system
    of Slavery is constantly bringing upon millions in this land of
    boasted freedom!

    Can you tell me where Sarah King is, who was at your house when
    I was there? She was going to Canada to meet her husband. Give
    my love to Mrs. Still & accept the same yourself. Your much
    indebted & obliged friend,

    HARRIET EGLIN.


The "difficulty" about which Harriet expressed so much regret in the
above letter, had reference to a letter supposed to have been written by
her friend Charlotte to Baltimore, about her clothing. It had been
intercepted, and in this way, a clue was obtained by one of the owners
as to how they escaped, who aided them, etc. On the strength of the
information thus obtained, a well-known colored man, named Adams, was
straightway arrested and put in prison at the instance of one of the
owners, and also a suit was at the same time instituted against the Rail
Road Company for damages--by which steps quite a huge excitement was
created in Baltimore. As to the colored man Adams, the prospect looked
simply hopeless. Many hearts were sad in view of the doom which they
feared would fall upon him for obeying a humane impulse (he had put the
girls on the cars). But with the Rail Road Company it was a different
matter; they had money, power, friends, etc., and could defy the courts.
In the course of a few months, when the suit against Adams and the Rail
Road Company came up, the Rail Road Company proved in court, in defense,
that the prosecutor entered the cars in search of his runaway, and went
and spoke to the two young women in "mourning" the day they escaped,
looking expressly for the identical parties, for which he was seeking
damages before the court, and that he declared to the conductor, on
leaving the cars, that the said "two girls in mourning, were not the
ones he was looking after," or in other words, that "neither" belonged
to him. This positive testimony satisfied the jury, and the Rail Road
Company and poor James Adams escaped by the verdict not guilty. The
owner of the lost property had the costs to pay of course, but whether
he was made a wiser or better man by the operation was never
ascertained.



THIRD LETTER.



    SENNETT, October 28th, 1856.

    DEAR MR. STILL:--I am happy to tell you that I am well and
    happy. I still live with Rev. Mr. Anderson in this place, I am
    learning to read and write. I do not like to trouble you too
    much, but I would like to know if you have heard anything more
    about my friends in Baltimore who got into trouble on our
    account. Do be pleased to write me if you can give me any
    information about them. I feel bad that they should suffer for
    me. I wish all my brethren and sisters in bondage, were as well
    off as I am. The girl that came with me is in Canada, near the
    Suspension Bridge. I was glad to see Green Murdock, a colored
    young man, who stopped at your house about six weeks ago, he
    knew my folks at the South. He has got into a good place to work
    in this neighborhood. Give my love to Mrs Still, and believe me
    your obliged friend,

    HARRIET EGLIN.

    P.S. I would like to know what became of Johnson,[A] the man
    whose foot was smashed by jumping off the cars, he was at your
    house when I was there.

    [Footnote A: Johnson was an unfortunate young fugitive, who,
    while escaping, beheld his master or pursuer in the cars, and
    jumped therefrom, crushing his feet shockingly by the bold act.]

this volume within due limits, in the cases to be noticed in this
chapter, it will be impossible to state more than a few of the
interesting particulars that make up these narratives. While some of
these passengers might not have been made in the prison house to drink
of the bitter cup as often as others, and in their flight might not have
been called upon to pass through as severe perils as fell to the lot of
others, nevertheless justice seems to require, that, as far as possible,
all the passengers passing over the Philadelphia Underground Rail Road
shall be noticed.



James Burrell. James was certainly justifiable in making his escape, if
for no other reason than on the score of being nearly related to the
chivalry of the South. He was a mulatto (the son of a white man
evidently), about thirty-two years of age, medium size, and of an
agreeable appearance. He was owned by a maiden lady, who lived at
Williamsburg, but not requiring his services in her own family, she
hired him out by the year to a Mr. John Walker, a manufacturer of
tobacco, for which she received $120 annually. This arrangement was not
satisfactory to James. He could not see why he should be compelled to
wear the yoke like an ox. The more he thought over his condition, the
more unhappy was his lot, until at last he concluded, that he could not
stand Slavery any longer. He had witnessed a great deal of the hardships
of the system of Slavery, and he had quite enough intelligence to
portray the horrors thereof in very vivid colors. It was the
auction-block horror that first prompted him to seek freedom. While
thinking how he would manage to get away safely, his wife and children
were ever present in his mind. He felt as a husband should towards his
"wife Betsy," and likewise loved his "children, Walter and Mary;" but
these belonged to another man, who lived some distance in the country,
where he had permission to see them only once a week. This had its
pleasure, it also had its painful influence. The weekly partings were a
never-failing source of unhappiness. So when James' mind was fully made
up to escape from Slavery, he decided that it would not be best to break
the secret to his poor wife and children, but to get off to Canada, and
afterwards to try and see what he could do for their deliverance. The
hour fixed to leave Virginia arrived, and he started and succeeded in
reaching Philadelphia, and the Committee. On arriving he needed
medicine, clothing, food, and a carriage for his accommodation, all
which were furnished freely by the Committee, and he was duly forwarded
to Canada. From Canada, with his name changed, he wrote as follows:


    TORONTO, March 28th, 1854.

    SIR, MR. STILL--It does me pleasure to forward you this letter
    hopeing when this comes to hand it may find your family well, as
    they leaves me at present. I will also say that the friends are
    well. Allow me to say to you that I arrived in this place on
    Friday last safe and sound, and feeles well under my safe
    arrival. Its true that I have not been employed as yet but I
    lives hopes to be at work very shortly. I likes this city very
    well, and I am in hopes that there a living here for me as much
    so as there for any one else. You will be please to write. I am
    bording at Mr. Phillip's Centre Street.

    I have nothing more at present. Yours most respectfull.

    W. BOURAL.




DANIEL WIGGINS, _alias_ DANIEL ROBINSON. Daniel fled from Norfolk, Va.,
where he had been owned by the late Richard Scott. Only a few days
before Daniel escaped, his so-called owner was summoned to his last
account. While ill, just before the close of his career, he often
promised D. his freedom and also promised, if restored, that he would
make amends for the past, by changing his ways of living. His son, who
was very reckless, he would frequently allude to and declared, "that
he," the son, "should not have his 'property.'" These dying sentiments
filled Daniel with great hopes that the day of his enslavement was
nearly at an end. Unfortunately, however, death visited the old master,
ere he had made provision for his slaves. At all events, no will was
found. That he might not fall a prey to the reckless son, he felt, that
he must nerve himself for a desperate struggle to obtain his freedom in
some other way, by traveling on the Underground Rail Road. While he had
always been debarred from book learning, he was, nevertheless, a man of
some intelligence, and by trade was a practical Corker.

He was called upon in this trying hour to leave his wife with three
children, but they were, fortunately, free. Coming to the Committee in
want, they cheerfully aided him, and forwarded him on to Canada. Thence,
immediately on his arrival, he returned the following grateful letter:


    NEW BEDFORD, Mass., March 22d, 1854.

    DEAR SIR:--I am happy to inform you that I arrived in this place
    this morning well and cheerful. I am, sir, to you and others
    under more obligations for your kindly protection of me than I
    can in any way express at present. May the Lord preserve you
    unto eternal life. Remember my respects to Mr. Lundy and family.
    Should the boat lay up please let me know.

    Yours respectfully,

    DAVID ROBINSON.

    Please forward to Dr. H. Lundy, after you have gotten through.
    With respects, &c.

    D.R.




WM. ROBINSON, _alias_ THOS. HARRED. William gave satisfactory evidence,
at first sight, that he was opposed to the unrequited labor system _in
toto_, and even hated still more the flogging practices of the chivalry.
Although he had reached his twenty-eighth year, and was a truly fair
specimen of his race, considering his opportunities, a few days before
William left, the overseer on the plantation attempted to flog him, but
did not succeed. William's manhood was aroused, and he flogged the
overseer soundly, if what he averred was true. The name of William's
owner was John G. Beale, Esq., of Fauquier county, Va. Beale was
considered to be a man of wealth, and had invested in Slave stock to the
number of seventy head. According to William's account of Beale, he was
a "hard man and thought no more of his black people than he did of
dogs." When William entered upon the undertaking of freeing himself from
Beale's barbarism, he had but one dollar and twenty-five cents in his
possession; but he had physical strength and a determined mind, and
being heartily sick of Slavery, he was willing to make the trial, even
at the cost of life. Thus hopeful, he prosecuted his journey with
success through strange regions of country, with but little aid or
encouragement before reaching Philadelphia. This feat, however, was not
performed without getting lost by the way. On arriving, his shoes were
gone, and his feet were severely travel-worn. The Committee rendered
needed aid, etc., and sent William on to Canada to work for himself, and
to be recognized as a subject of Great Britain.



EDWARD PEADEN AND WIFE HARRIET, AND SISTER CELIA. This man and his wife
and wife's sister were a nice-looking trio, but they brought quite a sad
story with them: the sale of their children, six in number. The auction
block had made such sad havoc among them, that no room was left to hope,
that their situation would ever be improved by remaining. Indeed they
had been under a very gloomy cloud for some time previous to leaving,
fearing that the auction block was shortly to be their doom. To escape
this fate, they were constrained to "secrete themselves for one month,"
until an opportunity offered them to secure a passage on a boat coming
to Philadelphia. Edward (the husband), was about forty-four years of
age, of a dark color, well made, full face, pleasant countenance, and
talked fluently. Dr. Price claimed him as his personal property, and
exacted all his hire and labor. For twelve years he had been hired out
for $100 per annum. Harriet, the wife of Edward, belonged to David
Baines, of Norfolk. Her general appearance indicated, that nature had
favored her physically and mentally, although being subjected to the
drudgery of Slave life, with no advantages for development, she was
simply a living testimony to the crushing influence of Slavery--with a
heart never free from the saddened recollection of the auction block, on
which all of her children had been sacrificed, "one by one." Celia, the
sister, also belonged to D. Baines, and was kept hired out--was last in
the service of the Mayor of Norfolk. Of her story nothing of any moment
was recorded. On their arrival in Philadelphia, as usual they were
handed over to the Committee, and their wants were met.



WILLIAM DAVIS. All that the records contain of William is as follows: He
left Emmitsburg, Md., the previous Friday night, where he had been held
by Dr. James Shoul. William is thirty-two years of age, dark color,
rather below medium stature. With regard to his slave life, he declared
that he had been "roughly used." Besides, for some time before escaping,
he felt that his owner was in the "notion of trading" him off. The fear
that this apprehended notion would be carried into execution, was what
prompted him to leave his master.



ALEXANDER BOGGS, alias JOHNSON HENSON. This subject was under the
ownership of a certain John Ernie, who lived about three miles from
Baltimore. Mr. Ernie had only been in possession of the wayward
Alexander three weeks, having purchased him of a trader named Dennit,
for $550. This was not the first time, however, that he had experienced
the trouble of changing masters, in consequence of having been sold.
Previously to his being disposed of by the trader Dennit, he had been
owned by Senator Merrick, who had the misfortune to fail in business, in
consequence whereof, his slaves had all to be sold and Alexander with
the rest, away from his wife, Caroline, and two children, James and
Eliezer.

This was a case that appealed for sympathy and aid, which were
cheerfully rendered by the Committee. Alexander was about fifty years of
age, of dark color. On the Records no account of cruel treatment is
found, other than being sold, &c.



JOHN BROWN, alias JACOB WILLIAMS, arrived from Fredericktown, Md., where
he had been working under the yoke of Joseph Postly. John was a young
man of twenty-nine years of age. Up to the hour of his escape, his lot
had been that of an ordinary slave. Indeed, he had much less to complain
of with reference to usage than most slaves; the only thing in this
respect the records contain, is simply a charge, that his master
threatened to sell him. But this did not seem to have been the motive
which prompted John to take leave of his master. Although untutored, he
had mind enough to comprehend that Postly had no right to oppress him,
and wrong him out of his hire. John concluded that he would not stand
such treatment any longer, and made up his mind to leave for Canada.
After due examination the Committee, finding his story reasonable, gave
him the usual assistance, advice and instruction, and sent him on
Canada-ward.



SAMUEL SLATER, alias PATTERSON SMITH, came from a place called Power
Bridge, Md. He gave a satisfactory account of himself, and was commended
for having wisely left his master, William Martin, to earn his bread by
the sweat of his own brow. Martin had held up the vision of the
auction-block before Sam; this was enough. Sam saw that it was time for
him to be getting out of danger's way without delay, so he presumed, if
others could manage to escape, he could too. And he succeeded. He was a
stout man, about twenty-nine years of age, of dark complexion. No
particular mention of ill treatment is found on the Records.

After arriving in Canada, his heart turned with deep interest and
affection to those left in the prison-house, as the following letter
indicates.


    ST. CATHRINES Oct 29th.

    MY DEAR FRIEND:--yours of the 15th came to hand and I was glad
    to hea from you and your dear family were well and the reason
    that I did not write sooner I expected get a letter from my
    brother in pennsylvania but I have not received any as yet when
    I wrote last I directed my letter to philip scott minister of
    the asbury church baltimore and that was the reason that I
    thought it strange I did not get an answer but I did not put my
    brother name to it I made arrangements before I left home with a
    family of smiths that I was to write to and the letter that I
    enclose in this I want you to direct it to D Philip scott in his
    care for mrs cassey Jackson Duke Jacksons wife and she will give
    to Priana smith or Sarah Jane Smith those are the persons I wish
    to write to I wish you to write on as quick as you can and let
    them know that there is a lady coming on by the name of mrs
    Holonsworth and she will call and see you and you will find her
    a very interesting and inteligent person one worthy of respect
    and esteem and a high reputation I must now bring my letter to a
    close no more at present but remain your humble servant

    PATTERSON SMITH

    In my letters I did not write to my friends how they shall write
    to me but in the letter that you write you will please to tell
    them how they shall write to me.




HARRISON BELL AND DAUGHTER HARRIET ANN. Father and daughter were
fortunate enough to escape together from Norfolk, Va.

Harrison was just in the prime of life, forty years of age, stout made,
good features, but in height was rather below medium, was a man of more
than ordinary shrewdness, by trade he was a chandler. He alleged that he
had been used hard.

Harriet Ann was a well-grown girl of pleasant appearance, fourteen years
of age. Father and daughter had each different owners, one belonged to
James Snyder, the other to John G. Hodgson.

Harrison had been informed that his children were to be sold; to prevent
this shocking fate, he was prompted to escape. Several months previous
to finding a chance to make a safe flight, he secreted himself with his
children in Norfolk, and so remained up to the day he left, a passage
having been secured for them on one of the boats coming to Philadelphia.
While the records contain no definite account of other children, it is
evident that there were others, but what became of them is not known.

If at the time of their arrival, it had been imagined that the glorious
day of universal freedom was only about eight years off, doubtless much
fuller records would have been made of these struggling Underground Rail
Road passengers. If Harrison's relatives and friends, who suddenly
missed him and his daughter Harriet Ann, in the Spring of 1854, are
still ignorant of his whereabouts, this very brief account of their
arrival in Philadelphia, may be of some satisfaction to all concerned,
not excepting his old master, whom he had served so faithfully.

The Committee finding them in need, had the pleasure of furnishing them
with food, material aid and a carriage, with cheering words and letters
of introduction to friends on the road to Canada.



DANIEL DAVIS, ALIAS DAVID SMITH, ADAM NICHOLSON, ALIAS JOHN WYNKOOP,
REUBEN BOWLES, ALIAS CUNNIGAN, ARRIVED FROM HEDGEVILLE, VA.

Daniel was only about twenty, just at a capital age to make a bold
strike for freedom. The appearance and air of this young aspirant for
liberty indicated that he was not of the material to be held in chains.
He was a man of medium size, well-built, dark color, and intelligent.
Hon. Charles J. Fortner, M.C. was the reputed owner of this young
fugitive, but the honorable gentleman having no use for his services, or
because he may have profited more by hiring him out, Daniel was placed
in the employ of a farmer, by the name of Adam Quigley. It was at this
time he resolved that he would not be a slave any longer. He declared
that Quigley was a "very mean man," one for whom he had no respect
whatever. Indeed he felt that the system of Slavery was an abomination
in any form it might be viewed. While he was yet so young, he had pretty
clear views with regard to Slavery, and remembered with feelings of deep
indignation, how his father had been sold when he himself was a boy,
just as a horse might have been sold; and how his mother was dragging
her chains in Slavery, up to the hour he fled. Thus in company with his
two companions he was prepared for any sacrifice.

Adam'S tale is soon told; all that is on the old record in addition to
his full name, is in the following words: "Adam is dark, rugged and
sensible, and was owned by Alexander Hill, a drunkard, gambler, &c."

Reuben had been hired out to John Sabbard near Hedgeville. Startled at
hearing that he was to be sold, he was led to consider the propriety of
seeking flight via the Underground Rail Road. These three young men were
all fine specimens of farm hands, and possessed more than average common
sense, considering the oppression they had to labor under. They walked
the entire distance from Hedgeville, Va., to Greenville, Pa. There they
took the cars and walked no more. They appeared travel-worn, garments
dirty, and forlorn; but the Committee had them cleanly washed, hair cut
and shaved, change of clothing furnished, &c., which at once made them
look like very different men. Means were appropriated to send them on
free of cost.



JAMES STEWART, _alias_ WM. JACKSON. James had been made acquainted with
the Peculiar Institution in Fauquier county, Va. Being of sound judgment
and firm resolution, he became an enemy to Slavery at a very early age;
so much so, that by the time he was twenty-one he was willing to put
into practice his views of the system by leaving it and going where all
men are free. Very different indeed were these notions, from those held
by his owner, Wm. Rose, who believed in Slavery for the black man. So as
James could neither enjoy his freedom nor express his opinion in
Virginia, he determined, that he had better get a passage on the
Underground Rail Road, and leave the land of Slavery and the obnoxious
sentiments of his master. He, of course, saw formidable difficulties to
be encountered all the way along in escaping, but these, he considered,
would be more easy for him to overcome than it would be for him to learn
the lesson--"Servants, obey your masters." The very idea made James
sick. This, therefore, was the secret of his escape.



HARRIET HALEY, _alias_ ANN RICHARDSON, AND ELIZABETH HALEY, _alias_
SARAH RICHARDSON. These travelers succeeded in escaping from Geo. C.
Davis, of Harford county, Md. In order to carry out their plans, they
took advantage of Whitsuntide, a holiday, and with marked ingenuity and
perseverance, they managed to escape and reach Quakertown Underground
Rail Road Station without obstruction, where protection and assistance
were rendered by the friends of the cause. After abiding there for a
short time, they were forwarded to the Committee in Philadelphia. Their
ages ranged from nineteen to twenty-one, and they were apparently
"servants" of a very superior order. The pleasure it afforded to aid
such young women in escaping from a condition so loathsome as that of
Slavery in Maryland, was unalloyed.



BENJAMIN DUNCANS, _alias_ GEORGE SCOTT. This individual was in bonds
under Thomas Jeffries, who was a firm believer in the doctrine:
"Servants, obey your masters," and, furthermore, while laboring "pretty
hard" to make Benjamin a convert to this idea, he had made Benjamin's
lot anything else than smooth. This treatment on the part of the master
made a wise and resolute man of the Slave. For as he looked earnestly
into the fact, that he was only regarded by his owner in the light of an
ox, or an ass, his manhood rebelled straightway, and the true light of
freedom told him, that he must be willing to labor, and endure suffering
for the great prize, liberty. So, in company with five others, at an
appointed time, he set out for freedom, and succeeded. The others,
alluded to, passed on to Canada direct. Benjamin was induced to stop a
few months in Pennsylvania, during which time he occupied himself in
farming. He looked as if he was well able to do a full day's work at
this occupation. He was about twenty-five years of age, of unmixed
blood, and wore a pleasant countenance.



MOSES WINES. Portsmouth, Va., lost one of her most substantial laborers
in the person of Moses, and Madam Abigail Wheeler, a very "likely
article" of merchandise. "No complaint" as to "ill treatment" was made
by Moses against "Miss Abigail." The truth was, he admitted, that he had
been used in a "mild way." With some degree of pride, he stated that he
"had never been flogged." But, for the "last fifteen years, he had been
favored with the exalted privilege of 'hiring' his time at the
'reasonable' sum of $12 per month." As he stood pledged to have this
amount always ready, "whether sick or well," at the end of the month,
his mistress "never neglected to be in readiness to receive it" to the
last cent. In this way Moses was taught to be exceedingly punctual. Who
would not commend such a mistress for the punctuality, if nothing more?
But as smoothly as matters seemed to be going along, the mischievous
idea crept into Moses' head, that he ought to have some of the money
claimed by his "kind" mistress, and at the same time, the thought would
often forcibly press upon his mind that he might any day be sold. In
addition to this unpleasant prospect, Virginia had just about that time
passed a law "prohibiting Slaves from hiring their time"--also, a number
of "new Police rules with reference to Slaves and free colored people,"
all of which, the "humane Slave-holders" of that "liberal State,"
regarded as highly essential both for the "protection and safety of
Master and Slave." But the stupid-headed Moses was not pleased with
these arrangements. In common with many of the Slaves, he smarted
severely under his heavy oppression, and felt that it was similar to an
old rule, which had been once tried under Pharaoh--namely, when the
children of Israel were required to "make bricks without straw." But
Moses was not a fit subject to submit to be ruled so inhumanly.

Despite the beautiful sermons he had often listened to in favor of
Slavery, and the many wise laws, above alluded to, he could not
reconcile himself to his condition. The laws and preaching were alike as
"sounding brass, and tinkling cymbals" to him. He made up his mind,
therefore, that he must try a free country; that his manhood required
him to make the effort at once, even at the risk of life. Father and
husband, as he was, and loving his wife, Grace, and son, Alphonso,
tenderly as he did, he nevertheless felt himself to be in chains, and
that he could do but little for them by remaining. He conceived that, if
he could succeed in gaining his freedom, he might possibly aid them away
also. With this hope in him, he contrived to secure a private passage on
the steamship City of Richmond, and in this way reached Philadelphia,
but not without suffering fearfully the entire journey through, owing to
the narrowness of the space into which he was obliged to be stowed in
order to get away.

Moses was a man of medium size, quite dark, and gave promise of being
capable of taking care of himself in freedom. He had seen much of the
cruelties of Slavery inflicted upon others in various forms, which he
related in a way to make one shudder; but these incidents were not
recorded in the book at the time.



SARAH SMITH, alias MILDRETH PAGE, and her daughter, nine years of age.
Sarah and her child were held to service by the Rev. A.D. Pollock, a
resident of Wilmington, Del. Until about nine months before she escaped
from the Reverend gentleman, she was owned by Mrs. Elizabeth Lee of
Fauquier Co., Va., who had moved with Sarah to Wilmington. How Mr.
Pollock came by Sarah is not stated on the records; perhaps by marriage;
be that as it may, it was owing to ill treatment from her mistress that
Sarah "took out" with her child. Sarah was a woman of becoming manners,
of a dark brown complexion, and looked as though she might do a fair
share of housework, if treated well. As it required no great effort to
escape from Wilmington, where the watchful Garrett lived, she reached
the Committee in Philadelphia without much difficulty, received
assistance and was sent on her way rejoicing.



LUCY GARRETT, alias JULIA WOOD. John Williams, who was said to be a
"very cruel man," residing on the Western Shore of Va., claimed Lucy as
his chattel personal. Julia, having a lively sense of his meanness stood
much in fear of being sold; having seen her father, three sisters, and
two brothers, disposed of at auction, she was daily on the look-out for
her turn to come next. The good spirit of freedom made the way plain to
her by which an escape could be effected. Being about nineteen years of
age, she felt that she had served in Slavery long enough. She resolved
to start immediately, and did so, and succeeded in reaching
Pennsylvania. Her appearance recommended her so well, that she was
prevailed upon to remain and accept a situation in the family of Joseph
A. Dugdale, so well known in reformatory circles, as an ardent friend of
humanity. While in his family she gave great satisfaction, and was much
esteemed for uprightness and industry. But this place was not Canada,
so, when it was deemed best, she was sent on.



ELLEN FORMAN, alias ELIZABETH YOUNG. Ellen had formerly been owned by
Dr. Thomas, of the Eastern Shore of Maryland, but about one year before
escaping, she was bought by a lady living in Baltimore known by the name
of Mrs. Johnson. Ellen was about thirty years of age, of slender
stature, and of a dark brown complexion. The record makes no mention of
cruel treatment or very hard usage, as a slave. From traveling,
probably, she had contracted a very heavy cold, which threatened her
with consumption. The Committee cheerfully rendered her assistance.



WILLIAM WOODEN, alias WILLIAM NELSON. While Delaware was not far from
freedom, and while Slavery was considered to exist there comparatively
in a mild form, nevertheless, what with the impenetrable ignorance in
which it was the wont of pro-slavery whites to keep the slaves, and the
unwillingness on the part of slave-holders generally to conform to the
spirit of progress going on in the adjacent State of Pennsylvania, it
was wonderful how the slaves saw through the thick darkness thus
prevailing, and how wide-awake they were to escape.

It was from this State, that William Wooden fled. True, William was said
to belong to Judge Wooden, of Georgetown, Del., but, according to the
story of his "chattel," the Judge was not of the class who judged
righteously. He had not only treated William badly, but he had
threatened to sell him. This was the bitter pill which constrained
William to "take out." The threat seemed hard at first, but its effect
was excellent for this young man; it was the cause of his obtaining his
freedom at the age of twenty-three. William was a tall, well-built man,
of dark complexion and promising. No further particulars concerning him
are on the records.



JAMES EDWARD HANDY, _alias_ DANIEL CANON. At Seaford, Delaware, James
was held in bonds under a Slave-holder called Samuel Lewis, who followed
farming. Lewis was not satisfied with working James hard and keeping all
his earnings, but would insolently talk occasionally of handing him
"over to the trader." This "stirred James' blood" and aroused his
courage to the "sticking point." Nothing could induce him to remain. He
had the name of having a wife and four children, but according to the
Laws of Delaware, he only had a nominal right in them. They were
"legally the property of Capt. Martin." Therefore they were all left in
the hands of Capt. Martin. The wife's name was Harriet Delaney, _alias_
Smart Stanley. James Henry Delaney came as a fellow-traveler with James
Edward. He had experienced oppression under Capt. Martin, and as a
witness, was prepared to testify, that Martin "ill-treated his Slaves,
especially with regard to the diet, which was very poor." Nevertheless
James was a stout, heavy-built young man of twenty-six years of age, and
looked as if he might have a great deal of valuable work in him. He was
a single man.



JAMES HENRY BLACKSON. James Henry had only reached twenty-five, when he
came to the "conclusion, that he had served long enough under bondage
for the benefit of Charles Wright." This was about all of the excuse he
seemed to have for escaping. He was a fine specimen of a man, so far as
physical strength and muscular power were concerned. Very little was
recorded of him.



GEORGE FREELAND. It was only by the most indomitable resolution and
perseverance, that Freeland threw off the yoke. Capt. John Pollard of
Petersburg, Va., held George to service. As a Slave-holder, Pollard
belonged to that class, who did not believe in granting favors to
Slaves. On the contrary, he was practically in favor of wringing every
drop of blood from their bodies.

George was a spare-built man, about twenty-five years of age, quite
dark, but had considerable intelligence. He could read and write very
well, but how he acquired these arts is not known. In testifying against
his master, George used very strong language. He declared that Pollard
"thought no more of his servants than if they had been dogs. He was very
mean. He gave nothing to his servants. He has given me only one pair of
shoes the last ten years." After careful inquiry, George learned that he
could get a private passage on the City of Richmond, if he could raise
the passage money. This he could do cheerfully. He raised "sixty
dollars" for the individual who was to "secrete him on the boat." In
leaving the land of Slave auctions, whips and chains, he was obliged to
leave his mother and father and two brothers in Petersburg. Pollard had
been offered $1,500 for George. Doubtless he found, when he discovered
George had gone, that he had "overstood the market." This was what
produced action prompt and decisive on the part of George. So the old
adage, in this case, was verified--"It's an ill wind that blows nobody
any good."

On arriving in Canada, George did not forget to express gratitude to
those who aided him on his road there, as the following note will show:


    SINCATHANS, canada west.

    Brother Still:--I im brace this opportunity of pening you a few
    lines to in form you that I am well at present & in hopes to
    find you & family well also I hope that god Will Bless you & and

    that I am well & hearty tell him to writ Thomas word that I am
    well at present you must excuse me I will Rite when I return
    from the west.

    GEORGE W. FREELAND

    Send your Letters in the name of John Anderson.




MILES WHITE. This passenger owed service to Albert Kern, of Elizabeth
City, N.C. At least Kern, through the oppressive laws of that State,
claimed Miles as his personal property. Miles, however, thought
differently, but he was not at liberty to argue the case with Kern; for
on the "side of the oppressor there was strength." So he resolved, that
he would adopt the Underground Rail Road plan. As he was only about
twenty-one years of age, he found it much easier to close his affairs
with North Carolina, than it would have been had he been encumbered with
a family. In fact, the only serious difficulty he had to surmount was to
find a captain with whom he could secure a safe passage North. To his
gratification it was not long before his efforts in this direction were
crowned with success. A vessel was being loaded with shingles, the
captain of which was kind enough to allow Miles to occupy a very secure
hiding-place thereon. In course of time, having suffered to the extent
usual when so closely conveyed, he arrived in Philadelphia, and being
aided, was duly forwarded by the Committee.



JOHN HALL, _alias_ JOHN SIMPSON. John fled from South Carolina. In this
hot-bed of Slavery he labored and suffered up to the age of thirty-two.
For a length of time before he escaped, his burdens were intolerable;
but he could see no way to rid himself of them, except by flight. Nor
was he by any means certain that an effort in this direction would prove
successful. In planning the route which he should take to travel North
he decided, that if success was for him, his best chance would be to
wend his way through North Carolina and Virginia. Not that he hoped to
find friends or helpers in these States. He had heard enough of the
cruelties of Slavery in these regions to convince him, that if he should
be caught, there would be no sympathy or mercy shown. Nevertheless the
irons were piercing him so severely, that he felt constrained to try his
luck, let the consequences be what they might, and so he set out for
freedom or death. Mountains of difficulties, and months of suffering and
privations by land and water, in the woods, and swamps of North Carolina
and Virginia, were before him, as his experience in traveling proved.
But the hope of final victory and his daily sufferings before he
started, kept him from faltering, even when starvation and death seemed
to be staring him in the face. For several months he was living in dens
and caves of the earth.

Ultimately, however, the morning of his ardent hopes dawned. How he
succeeded in finding a captain who was kind enough to afford him a
secret hiding-place on his boat, was not noted on the records. Indeed
the incidents of his story were but briefly written out. Similar cases
of thrilling interest seemed almost incredible, and the Committee were
constrained to doubt the story altogether until other testimony could be
obtained to verify the statement. In this instance, before the Committee
were fully satisfied, they felt it necessary to make inquiry of
trustworthy Charlestonians to ascertain if John were really from
Charleston, and if he were actually owned by the man that he represented
as having owned him, Dr. Philip Mazyck, by name; and furthermore, to
learn if the master was really of the brutal character given him. The
testimony of thoroughly reliable persons, who were acquainted with
master and slave, so far as this man's bondage in Charleston was
concerned, fully corroborated his statement, and the Committee could not
but credit his story; indeed they were convinced, that he had been one
of the greatest of sufferers and the chief of heroes. Nevertheless his
story was not written out, and can only be hinted at. Perhaps more time
was consumed in its investigation and in listening to a recital of his
sufferings than could well be spared; perhaps it was thought, as was
often the case, unless full justice could be given him, the story would
be spoiled; or perhaps the appalling nature of his sufferings rendered
the pen powerless, and made the heart too sick for the task. Whether it
was so or not in this case, it was not unfrequently so in other
instances, as is well remembered. It will be necessary, in the
subsequent pages of this work, to omit the narratives of a great many
who, unfortunately, were but briefly noted on the books at the time of
their arrival. In the eyes of some, this may prove disappointing,
especially in instances where these pages are turned to with the hope of
gaining a clue to certain lost ones. As all, however, cannot be
mentioned, and as the general reader will look for incidents and facts
which will most fittingly bring out the chief characteristics in the
career and escape of bondmen, the reasonableness of this course must be
obvious to all.

CHARLES GILBERT.


FLEEING FROM DAVIS A NEGRO TRADER, SECRETED UNDER A HOTEL, UP A TREE,
UNDER A FLOOR, IN A THICKET, ON A STEAMER. In 1854 Charles was owned in
the city of Richmond by Benjamin Davis, a notorious negro trader.
Charles was quite a "likely-looking article," not too black or too
white, but rather of a nice "ginger-bread color." Davis was of opinion
that this "article" must bring him a tip-top price. For two or three
months the trader advertised Charles for sale in the papers, but for
some reason or other Charles did not command the high price demanded.

While Davis was thus daily trying to sell Charles, Charles was
contemplating how he might escape. Being uncommonly shrewd he learned
something about a captain of a schooner from Boston, and determined to
approach him with regard to securing a passage. The captain manifested a
disposition to accommodate him for the sum of ten dollars, provided
Charles could manage to get to Old Point Comfort, there to embark. The
Point was about one hundred and sixty miles distant from Richmond.

A man of ordinary nerve would have declined this condition
unhesitatingly. On the other hand it was not Charles' intention to let
any offer slide; indeed he felt that he must make an effort, if he
failed. He could not see how his lot could be made more miserable by
attempting to flee. In full view of all the consequences he ventured to
take the hazardous step, and to his great satisfaction he reached Old
Point Comfort safely. In that locality he was well known, unfortunately
too well known, for he had been raised partly there, and, at the same
time, many of his relatives and acquaintances were still living there.
These facts were evidently well known to the trader, who unquestionably
had snares set in order to entrap Charles should he seek shelter among
his relatives, a reasonable supposition. Charles had scarcely reached
his old home before he was apprised of the fact that the hunters and
watch dogs of Slavery were eagerly watching for him. Even his nearest
relatives, through fear of consequences had to hide their faces as it
were from him. None dare offer him a night's lodging, scarcely a cup of
water, lest such an act might be discovered by the hunters, whose
fiendish hearts would have found pleasure in meting out the most dire
punishments to those guilty of thus violating the laws of Slavery. The
prospect, if not utterly hopeless, was decidedly discouraging. The way
to Boston was entirely closed. A "reward of $200" was advertised for his
capture. For the first week after arriving at Old Point he entrusted
himself to a young friend by the name of E.S. The fear of the pursuers
drove him from his hiding-place at the expiration of the week. Thence he
sought shelter neither with kinfolks, Christians, nor infidels, but in
this hour of his calamity he made up his mind that he would try living
under a large hotel for a while. Having watched his opportunity, he
managed to reach Higee hotel, a very large house without a cellar,
erected on pillars three or four feet above the ground. One place alone,
near the cistern, presented some chance for a hiding-place, sufficient
to satisfy him quite well under the circumstances. This dark and gloomy
spot he at once willingly occupied rather than return to Slavery. In
this refuge he remained four weeks. Of course he could not live without
food; but to communicate with man or woman would inevitably subject him
to danger. Charles' experience in the neighborhood of his old home left
no ground for him to hope that he would be likely to find friendly aid
anywhere under the shadow of Slavery. In consequence of these fears he
received his food from the "slop tub," securing this diet in the
darkness of night after all was still and quiet around the hotel. To use
his own language, the meals thus obtained were often "sweet" to his
taste.

One evening, however, he was not a little alarmed by the approach of an
Irish boy who came under the hotel to hunt chickens. While prowling
around in the darkness he appeared to be making his way unconsciously to
the very spot where Charles was reposing. How to meet the danger was to
Charles' mind at first very puzzling, there was no time now to plan. As
quick as thought he feigned the bark of a savage dog accompanied with a
furious growl and snarl which he was confident would frighten the boy
half out of his senses, and cause him to depart quickly from his private
apartment. The trick succeeded admirably, and the emergency was
satisfactorily met, so far as the boy was concerned, but the boy's
father hearing the attack of the dog, swore that he would kill him.
Charles was a silent listener to the threat, and he saw that he could no
longer remain in safety in his present quarter. So that night he took
his departure for Bay Shore; here he decided to pass a day in the woods,
but the privacy of this place was not altogether satisfactory to
Charles' mind; but where to find a more secure retreat he could
not,--dared not venture to ascertain that day. It occurred to him,
however, that he would be much safer up a tree than hid in the bushes
and undergrowth. He therefore climbed up a large acorn tree and there
passed an entire day in deep meditation.  No gleam of hope appeared, yet
he would not suffer himself to think of returning to bondage. In this
dilemma he remembered a poor washer-woman named Isabella, a slave who
had charge of a wash-house. With her he resolved to seek succor. Leaving
the woods he proceeded to the wash-house and was kindly received by
Isabella, but what to do with him or how to afford him any protection
she could see no way whatever. The schooling which Charles had been
receiving a number of weeks in connection with the most fearful
looking-for of the threatened wrath of the trader made it much easier
for him than for her to see how he could be provided for. A room and
comforts he was not accustomed to. Of course he could not expect such
comforts now. Like many another escaping from the relentless tyrant,
Charles could contrive methods which to his venturesome mind would
afford hope, however desperate they might appear to others. He thought
that he might be safe under the floor. To Isabella the idea was new, but
her sympathies were strongly with Charles, and she readily consented to
accommodate him under the floor of the wash-house. Isabella and a friend
of Charles, by the name of John Thomas, were the only persons who were
cognizant of this arrangement. The kindness of these friends, manifested
by their willingness to do anything in their power to add to the comfort
of Charles, was proof to him that his efforts and sufferings had not
been altogether in vain. He remained under the floor two weeks,
accessible to kind voices and friendly ministrations. At the end of this
time his repose was again sorely disturbed by reports from without that
suspicion had been awakened towards the wash-house. How this happened
neither Charles nor his friends could conjecture. But the arrival of six
officers whom he could hear talking very plainly in the house, whose
errand was actually to search for him, convinced him that he had never
for a single moment been in greater danger. The officers not only
searched the house, but they offered his friend John Thomas $25 if he
would only put them on Charles' track. John professed to know nothing;
Isabella was equally ignorant. Discouraged with their efforts on this
occasion, the officers gave up the hunt and left the house. Charles,
however, had had enough of the floor accommodations. He left that night
and returned to his old quarters under the hotel. Here he stayed one
week, at the expiration of which time the need of fresh air was so
imperative, that he resolved to go out at night to Allen's cottage and
spend a day in the woods. He had knowledge of a place where the
undergrowth and bushes were almost impenetrable. To rest and refresh
himself in this thicket he felt would be a great comfort to him. Without
serious difficulty he reached the thicket, and while pondering over the
all-absorbing matter as to how he should ever manage to make his escape,
an old man approached. Now while Charles had no reason to think that he
was sought by the old intruder, his very near approach admonished him
that it would neither be safe nor agreeable to allow him to come nearer.
Charles remembering that his trick of playing the dog, when previously
in danger under the hotel, had served a good end, thought that it would
work well in the thicket. So he again tried his power at growling and
barking hideously for a moment or two, which at once caused the man to
turn his course. Charles could hear him distinctly retreating, and at
the same time cursing the dog. The owner of the place had the reputation
of keeping "bad dogs," so the old man poured out a dreadful threat
against "Stephens' dogs," and was soon out of the reach of the one in
the thicket.

[Illustration: ]

Notwithstanding his success in frightening off the old man, CHARLES felt
that the thicket was by no means a safe place for him. He concluded to
make another change. This time he sought a marsh; two hours' stay there
was sufficient to satisfy him, that that too was no place to tarry in,
even for a single night. He, therefore, left immediately. A third time,
he returned to the hotel, where he remained only two days. His appeals
had at last reached the heart of his mother--she could no longer bear to
see him struggling, and suffering, and not render him aid, whatever the
consequences might be. If she at first feared to lend him a helping
hand, she now resolutely worked with a view of saving money to succor
him. Here the prospect began to brighten.

A passage was secured for him on a steamer bound for Philadelphia. One
more day, and night must elapse, ere he could be received on board. The
joyful anticipations which now filled his breast left no room for fear;
indeed, he could scarcely contain himself; he was drunk with joy. In
this state of mind he concluded that nothing would afford him more
pleasure before leaving, than to spend his last hours at the wash house,
"under the floor." To this place he went with no fear of hunters before
his eyes. Charles had scarcely been three hours in this place, however,
before three officers came in search of him. Two of them talked with
Isabella, asked her about her "boarders," etc.; in the meanwhile, one of
them uninvited, made his way up stairs. It so happened, that Charles was
in this very portion of the house. His case now seemed more hopeless
than ever. The officer up stairs was separated from him simply by a thin
curtain. Women's garments hung all around. Instead of fainting or
surrendering, in the twinkling of an eye, Charles' inventive intellect,
led him to enrobe himself in female attire. Here, to use his own
language, a "thousand thoughts" rushed into his mind in a minute. The
next instant he was going down stairs in the presence of the officers,
his old calico dress, bonnet and rig, attracting no further attention
than simply to elicit the following simple questions: "Whose gal are
you?" "Mr. Cockling's, sir." "What is your name?" "Delie, sir." "Go on
then!" said one of the officers, and on Charles went to avail himself of
the passage on the steamer which his mother had procured for him for the
sum of thirty dollars.

In due time, he succeeded in getting on the steamer, but he soon
learned, that her course was not direct to Philadelphia, but that some
stay would be made in Norfolk, Va. Although disappointed, yet this being
a step in the right direction, he made up his mind to be patient. He was
delayed in Norfolk four weeks. From the time Charles first escaped, his
owner (Davis the negro trader), had kept a standing reward of $550
advertised for his recovery. This showed that Davis was willing to risk
heavy expenses for Charles as well as gave evidence that he believed him
still secreted either about Richmond, Petersburg, or Old Point Comfort.
In this belief he was not far from being correct, for Charles spent most
of his time in either of these three places, from the day of his escape
until the day that he finally embarked. At last, the long looked-for
hour arrived to start for Philadelphia.

He was to leave his mother, with no hope of ever seeing her again, but
she had purchased herself and was called free. Her name was Margaret
Johnson. Three brothers likewise were ever in his thoughts, (in chains),
"Henry," "Bill," and "Sam," (half brothers). But after all the hope of
freedom outweighed every other consideration, and he was prepared to
give up all for liberty. To die rather than remain a slave was his
resolve.

Charles arrived per steamer, from Norfolk, on the 11th day of November,
1854. The Richmond papers bear witness to the fact, that Benjamin Davis
advertised Charles Gilbert, for mouths prior to this date, as has been
stated in this narrative. As to the correctness of the story, all that
the writer has to say is, that he took it down from the lips of Charles,
hurriedly, directly after his arrival, with no thought of magnifying a
single incident. On the contrary, much that was of interest in the story
had to be omitted. Instead of being overdrawn, not half of the
particulars were recorded. Had the idea then been entertained, that the
narrative of this young slave-warrior was to be brought to light in the
manner and time that it now is, a far more thrilling account of his
adventures might have been written. Other colored men who knew both
Davis and Charles, as well as one man ordinarily knows another, rejoiced
at seeing Charles in Philadelphia, and they listened with perfect faith
to his story. So marvellous were the incidents of his escape, that his
sufferings in Slavery, previous to his heroic struggles to throw off the
yoke, were among the facts omitted from the records. While this may be
regretted it is, nevertheless, gratifying on the whole to have so good
an account of him as was preserved. It is needless to say, that the
Committee took especial pleasure in aiding him, and listening to so
remarkable a story narrated so intelligently by one who had been a
slave.

LIBERTY OR DEATH.


JIM BOW-LEGS, _alias_ BILL PAUL.

In 1855 a traveler arrived with the above name, who, on examination, was
found to possess very extraordinary characteristics. As a hero and
adventurer some passages of his history were most remarkable. His
schooling had been such as could only be gathered on plantations under
brutal overseers;--or while fleeing,--or in swamps,--in prisons,--or on
the auction-block, etc.; in which condition he was often found.
Nevertheless in these circumstances his mind got well stored with
vigorous thoughts--neither books nor friendly advisers being at his
command. Yet his native intelligence as it regarded human nature, was
extraordinary. His resolution and perseverance never faltered. In all
respects he was a remarkable man. He was a young man, weighing about one
hundred and eighty pounds, of uncommon muscular strength. He was born in
the State of Georgia, Oglethorpe county, and was owned by Dr. Thomas
Stephens, of Lexington. On reaching the Vigilance Committee in
Philadelphia, his story was told many times over to one and another.
Hour after hour was occupied by friends in listening to the simple
narrative of his struggles for freedom. A very full account of "Jim,"
was forwarded in a letter to M.A. Shadd, the then Editress of the
"Provincial Freeman." Said account has been carefully preserved, and is
here annexed as it appeared in the columns of the above named paper:


    "I must now pass to a third adventurer. The one to whom I
    allude, is a young man of twenty-six years of age, by the name
    of 'Jim,' who fled from near Charleston, S.C. Taking all the
    facts and circumstances into consideration respecting the
    courageous career of this successful adventurer for freedom, his
    case is by far more interesting than any I have yet referred to.
    Indeed, for the good of the cause, and the honor of one who
    gained his liberty by periling his life so frequently:--shot
    several times,--making six unsuccessful attempts to escape from
    the far South,--numberless times chased by
    bloodhounds,--captured, imprisoned and sold repeatedly,--living
    for months in the woods, swamps and caves, subsisting mainly on
    parched corn and berries, &c., &c., his narrative ought, by all
    means, to be published, though I doubt very much whether many
    could be found who could persuade themselves to believe
    one-tenth part of this marvellous story.

    Though this poor Fugitive was utterly ignorant of letters, his
    natural good sense and keen perception qualified him to arrest
    the attention and interest the heart in a most remarkable
    degree.

    His master finding him not available, on account of his
    absconding propensities, would gladly have offered him for sale.
    He was once taken to Florida, for that purpose; but, generally,
    traders being wide awake, on inspecting him, would almost
    invariably pronounce him a 'd----n rascal,' because he would
    never fail to eye them sternly, as they inspected him. The
    obedient and submissive slave is always recognized by hanging
    his head and looking on the ground, when looked at by a
    slave-holder. This lesson Jim had never learned, hence he was
    not to be trusted.

    His head and chest, and indeed his entire structure, as solid as
    a rock, indicated that he was physically no ordinary man; and
    not being under the influence of the spirit of "non-resistance,"
    he had occasionally been found to be a rather formidable
    customer.

    His father was a full-blooded Indian, brother to the noted
    Indian Chief, Billy Bowlegs; his mother was quite black and of
    unmixed blood.

    For five or six years, the greater part of Jim's time was
    occupied in trying to escape, and in being in prison for sale,
    to punish him for running away.

    His mechanical genius was excellent, so were his geographical
    abilities. He could make shoes or do carpenter's work very
    handily, though he had never had the chance to learn. As to
    traveling by night or day, he was always road-ready and having
    an uncommon memory, could give exceedingly good accounts of what
    he saw, etc.

    When he entered a swamp, and had occasion to take a nap he took
    care first to decide upon the posture he must take, so that if
    come upon unexpectedly by the hounds and slave-hunters, he might
    know in an instant which way to steer to defeat them. He always
    carried a liquid, which he had prepared, to prevent hounds from
    scenting him, which he said had never failed. As soon as the
    hounds came to the place where he had rubbed his legs and feet
    with said liquid, they could follow him no further, but howled
    and turned immediately.

    Quite a large number of the friends of the slave saw this
    noble-hearted fugitive, and would sit long and listen with the
    most undivided attention to his narrative--none doubting for a
    moment, I think, the entire truthfulness of his story. Strange
    as his story was, there was so much natural simplicity in his
    manner and countenance, one could not refrain from believing
    him."

SALT-WATER FUGITIVE.


This was an exceptional case, as this passenger did not reach the
Vigilance Committee of Philadelphia, yet to exclude him on this account,
would be doing an injustice to history.

The facts in his case were incontestably established in the Philadelphia
Register in April, 1854, from which the following thrilling account is
taken:


    The steamship, Keystone State, which arrived at this port on
    Saturday morning, had just entered Delaware Bay, when a man was
    discovered secreted outside of the vessel and under the guards.
    When brought from his hiding-place, he was found to be a
    Fugitive Slave, who had secreted himself there before the vessel
    left Savannah on Wednesday, and had remained in that place from
    the time of starting!

    His position was such, that the water swept over and around him
    almost constantly. He had some bread in his pocket, which he had
    intended for subsistence until he could reach a land of liberty.
    It was saturated with sea-water and dissolved to a pulp.

    When our readers remember the high winds of Friday, and the
    sudden change to cold during that night, and the fact that the
    fugitive had remained in that situation for three days and
    nights, we think it will be conceded that he fully earned his
    liberty, and that the "institution," which was so intolerable
    that he was willing to run the risk of almost certain death to
    escape from it had no very great attractions for him. But the
    poor man was doomed to disappointment. The captain ordered the
    vessel to put into Newcastle, where, the fugitive, hardly able
    to stand, was taken on shore and incarcerated, and where he now
    awaits the order of his owner in Savannah. The following
    additional particulars are from the same paper of the 21st.





    The Keystone State case.--Our article yesterday morning brought
    us several letters of inquiry and offers of contributions to aid
    in the purchase from his master of the unfortunate inmate of
    Newcastle jail. In answer to the former, we would say, that the
    steamer Keystone State, left Savannah, at 9 A.M., last
    Wednesday. It was about the same hour next morning that the men
    engaged in heaving lead, heard a voice from under the guards
    imploring help. A rope was procured, and the man relieved from
    his dangerous and suffering situation. He was well cared for
    immediately; a suit of dry clothes was furnished him, and he was
    given his share of the contents of the boat pantry. On arriving
    at Newcastle, the captain had him placed in jail, for the
    purpose, as we are informed, of taking him back to Savannah.

    To those who have offered contributions so liberally, we answer,
    that the prospect is, that only a small amount will be
    needed--enough to fee a lawyer to sue out a writ of habeas
    corpus. The salt water fugitive claims to be a free man, and a
    native of Philadelphia. He gives his name as Edward Davis, and
    says that he formerly lived at No. 5 Steel's court, that he was
    a pupil in Bird's school, on Sixth St. above Lombard, and that
    he has a sister living at Mr. Diamond's, a distiller, on South
    St. We are not informed why he was in Georgia, from which he
    took such an extraordinary means to effect his escape. If the
    above assertion be true, we apprehend little trouble in
    restoring the man to his former home. The claim of the captain
    to take him back to Savannah, will not be listened to for a
    moment by any court. The only claim the owners of the "Keystone
    State" or the captain can have on salt water Davis, is for half
    passenger fare; he came half the way as a fish. A gentleman who
    came from Wilmington yesterday, assures us that the case is in
    good hands at Newcastle.




FULL PARTICULARS OF THE ABDUCTION, ENSLAVING AND ESCAPE OF DAVIS.
ATTEMPT TO SEDUCE HIM TO SLAVERY AGAIN.



    The case of the colored man Davis, who made such a bold stroke
    to regain his liberty, by periling his life on board the steamer
    Keystone State, has excited very general attention. He has given
    a detailed account of his abduction and sale as a slave in the
    State of Maryland and Georgia, and some of his adventures up to
    the time of reaching Delaware. His own story is substantially as
    follows:

    He left Philadelphia on the 15th of September, 1851, and went to
    Harrisburg, intending to go to Hollidaysburg; took a canal boat
    for Havre de Grace, where he arrived next day. There he hired on
    board the schooner Thomas and Edward (oyster boat), of
    Baltimore. Went from Havre de Grace to St. Michael's, for
    oysters, thence to Baltimore, and thence to Havre de Grace
    again.

    He then hired to a Mr. Sullivan, who kept a grocery store, to do
    jobs. While there, a constable, named Smith, took him before a
    magistrate named Graham, who fined him fifteen or twenty dollars
    for violating the law in relation to free negroes coming into
    the State. This fine he was not able to pay, and Smith took him
    to Bell Air prison. Sheriff Gaw wrote to Mr. Maitland in
    Philadelphia, to whom he referred, and received an answer that
    Mr. Maitland was dead and none of the family knew him. He
    remained in that prison nearly two months. He then had a trial
    in court before a Judge Grier (most unfortunate name), who
    sentenced him to be sold to pay his fine and expenses, amounting
    to fifty dollars.

    After a few days and _without being offered at public sale_, he
    was taken out of jail at two o'clock in the morning and carried
    to Campbell's slave pen, in Baltimore, where he remained several
    months. While there, he was employed to cook for some fifty or
    sixty slaves, being told that he was working out his fine and
    jail fees. After being there about six months, he was taken out
    of prison, handcuffed by one Winters, who took him and two or
    three others to Washington and thence to Charleston, S.C. Here
    Winters left them, and they were taken by steamboat to Savannah.
    While on board the boat, he learned that himself and the other
    two had been sold to Mr. William Dean, of Macon, where he stayed
    two days, and was taken from that place to the East Valley
    Railroad.

    Subsequently he was sent to work on the Possum Tail Railroad.
    Here he was worked so hard, that in one month he lost his
    health. The other two men taken on with him, failed before he
    did. He was then sent to Macon, and thence to the cotton
    plantation again.

    During the time he worked on the railroad he had allowed him for
    food, one peck of corn meal, four pounds of bacon, and one quart
    of molasses per week. He cooked it himself at night, for the
    next day's use. He worked at packing cotton for four or five
    months, and in the middle of November, 1852, was sent back to
    the railroad, where he was again set to wheeling.

    He worked at "task work" two months, being obliged to wheel
    _sixteen_ square yards per day. At the end of two months he
    broke down again, and was sick. They tried one month to cure
    him, but did not succeed. In July, 1853, he was taken to an
    infirmary in Macon. Dr. Nottinghan and Dr. Harris, of that
    institution, both stated that his was the worst case of the kind
    they ever had. He remained at the infirmary two months and
    partially recovered. He told the story of his wrongs to these
    physicians, who tried to buy him. One of his legs was drawn up
    so that he could not walk well, and they offered four hundred
    dollars for him, which his master refused. The doctors wanted
    him to attend their patients, (mostly slaves). While in Georgia
    he was frequently asked where he came from, being found more
    intelligent than the common run of slaves.

    On the 12th of March he ran away from Macon and went to
    Savannah. There he hid in a stable until Tuesday afternoon at
    six o'clock, when he secreted himself on board the Keystone
    State. At 9 o'clock the next morning the Keystone State left
    with Davis secreted, as we have before stated. With his
    imprisonment in Newcastle, after being pronounced free, our
    readers are already familiar. We subjoin the documents on which
    he was discharged from his imprisonment in Newcastle, and his
    subsequent re-committal on the oath of Capt. Hardie.

    without a pass, these are therefore to command you, the said Wm.
    R. Lynam, forthwith to convey and deliver into the custody of
    the said Sheriff, or keeper of the said jail, the body of the
    said Davis, and you the said Sheriff or receiver of the body of
    the said Davis into your custody in the said jail, and him there
    safely keep until he be thence delivered by due course of the
    law.

    Given under my hand and seal at New Castle this 21st day of
    March, A.D., 1854.

    JOHN BRADFORD, J.P.


On the fourth of April, the Marshal of Macon called at the jail in
Newcastle, and demanded him as a fugitive slave, but the Sheriff refused
to give him up until a fair hearing could be had according to the laws
of the State of Delaware. The Marshal has returned to Georgia, and will
probably bring the claimant on the next trip of the Keystone State. The
authorities of Delaware manifest no disposition to deliver up a man
whose freedom has been so clearly proved; but every effort will be made
to reduce him again to slavery by the man who claims him, in which, it
seems, he has the hearty co-operation of Capt. Hardie. A trial will be
had before U.S. Commissioner Guthrie, and we have every reason to
suppose it will be a fair one. The friends of right and justice should
remember that such a trial will be attended with considerable expense,
and that the imprisoned man has been too long deprived of his liberty to
have money to pay for his own defence.

SAMUEL GREEN ALIAS WESLEY KINNARD, AUGUST 28th, 1854.


TEN YEARS IN THE PENITENTIARY FOR HAVING A COPY OF UNCLE TOM'S CABIN.


The passenger answering to the above name, left Indian Creek, Chester
Co., Md., where he had been held to service or labor, by Dr. James Muse.
One week had elapsed from the time he set out until his arrival in
Philadelphia. Although he had never enjoyed school privileges of any
kind, yet he was not devoid of intelligence. He had profited by his
daily experience as a slave, and withal, had managed to learn to read
and write a little, despite law and usage to the contrary. Sam was about
twenty-five years of age and by trade, a blacksmith. Before running
away, his general character for sobriety, industry, and religion, had
evidently been considered good, but in coveting his freedom and running
away to obtain it, he had sunk far below the utmost limit of forgiveness
or mercy in the estimation of the slave-holders of Indian Creek.

During his intercourse with the Vigilance Committee, while rejoicing
over his triumphant flight, he gave, with no appearance of excitement,
but calmly, and in a common-sense like manner, a brief description of
his master, which was entered on the record book substantially as
follows: "Dr. James Muse is thought by the servants to be the worst man
in Maryland, inflicting whipping and all manner of cruelties upon the
servants."

While Sam gave reasons for this sweeping charge, which left no room for
doubt, on the part of the Committee, of his sincerity and good judgment,
it was not deemed necessary to make a note of more of the doctor's
character than seemed actually needed, in order to show why "Sam" had
taken passage on the Underground Rail Road. For several years, "Sam" was
hired out by the doctor at blacksmithing; in this situation, daily
wearing the yoke of unrequited labor, through the kindness of Harriet
Tubman (sometimes called "Moses"), the light of the Underground Rail
Road and Canada suddenly illuminated his mind. It was new to him, but he
was quite too intelligent and liberty-loving, not to heed the valuable
information which this sister of humanity imparted. Thenceforth he was
in love with Canada, and likewise a decided admirer of the U.R. Road.
Harriet was herself, a shrewd and fearless agent, and well understood
the entire route from that part of the country to Canada. The spring
previous, she had paid a visit to the very neighborhood in which "Sam"
lived, expressly to lead her own brothers out of "Egypt." She succeeded.
To "Sam" this was cheering and glorious news, and he made up his mind,
that before a great while, Indian Creek should have one less slave and
that Canada should have one more citizen. Faithfully did he watch an
opportunity to carry out his resolution. In due time a good Providence
opened the way, and to "Sam's" satisfaction he reached Philadelphia,
having encountered no peculiar difficulties. The Committee, perceiving
that he was smart, active, and promising, encouraged his undertaking,
and having given him friendly advice, aided him in the usual manner.
Letters of introduction were given him, and he was duly forwarded on his
way. He had left his father, mother, and one sister behind. Samuel and
Catharine were the names of his parents. Thus far, his escape would seem
not to affect his parents, nor was it apparent that there was any other
cause why the owner should revenge himself upon them.

The father was an old local preacher in the Methodist Church--much
esteemed as an inoffensive, industrious man; earning his bread by the
sweat of his brow, and contriving to move along in the narrow road
allotted colored people bond or free, without exciting a spirit of ill
will in the pro-slavery power of his community. But the rancor awakened
in the breast of slave-holders in consequence of the high-handed step
the son had taken, brought the father under suspicion and hate. Under
the circumstances, the eye of Slavery could do nothing more than watch
for an occasion to pounce upon him. It was not long before the desired
opportunity presented itself. Moved by parental affection, the old man
concluded to pay a visit to his boy, to see how he was faring in a
distant land, and among strangers. This resolution he quietly carried
into effect. He found his son in Canada, doing well; industrious; a man
of sobriety, and following his father's footsteps religiously. That the
old man's heart was delighted with what his eyes saw and his ears heard
in Canada, none can doubt. But in the simplicity of his imagination, he
never dreamed that this visit was to be made the means of his
destruction. During the best portion of his days he had faithfully worn
the badge of Slavery, had afterwards purchased his freedom, and thus
become a free man. He innocently conceived the idea that he was doing no
harm in availing himself not only of his God-given rights, but of the
rights that he had also purchased by the hard toil of his own hands. But
the enemy was lurking in ambush for him--thirsting for his blood. To his
utter consternation, not long after his return from his visit to his son
"a party of gentlemen from the New Market district, went at night to
Green's house and made search, whereupon was found a copy of Uncle Tom's
Cabin, etc." This was enough--the hour had come, wherein to wreak
vengeance upon poor Green. The course pursued and the result, may be
seen in the following statement taken from the Cambridge (Md.),
"Democrat," of April 29th, 1857, and communicated by the writer to the
"Provincial Freeman."


    SAM GREEN.

    The case of the State against Sam Green (free negro) indicted
    for having in his possession, papers, pamphlets and pictorial
    representations, having a tendency to create discontent, etc.,
    among the people of color in the State, was tried before the
    court on Friday last.

    This case was of the utmost importance, and has created in the
    public mind a great deal of interest--it being the first case of
    the kind ever having occurred in our country.

    It appeared, in evidence, that this Green has a son in Canada,
    to whom Green made a visit last summer. Since his return to this
    county, suspicion has fastened upon him, as giving aid and
    assisting slaves who have since absconded and reached Canada,
    and several weeks ago, a party of gentlemen from New Market
    district, went at night, to Green's house and made search,
    whereupon was found a volume of "Uncle Tom's Cabin," a map of
    Canada, several schedules of routes to the North, and a letter
    from his son in Canada, detailing the pleasant trip he had, the
    number of friends he met with on the way, with plenty to eat,
    drink, etc., and concludes with a request to his father, that he
    shall tell certain other slaves, naming them, to come on, which
    slaves, it is well known, did leave shortly afterwards, and have
    reached Canada. The case was argued with great ability, the
    counsel on both sides displaying a great deal of ingenuity,
    learning and eloquence. The first indictment was for the having
    in possession the letter, map and route schedules.

    Notwithstanding the mass of evidence given, to show the
    prisoner's guilt, in unlawfully having in his possession these
    documents, and the nine-tenths of the community in which he
    lived, believed that he had a hand in the running away of
    slaves, it was the opinion of the court, that the law under
    which he was indicted, was not applicable to the case, and that
    he must, accordingly, render a verdict of not guilty.

    He was immediately arraigned upon another indictment, for having
    in possession "Uncle Tom's Cabin," and tried; in this case the
    court has not yet rendered a verdict, but holds it under _curia_
    till after the Somerset county court. It is to be hoped, the
    court will find the evidence in this case sufficient to bring it
    within the scope of the law under which the prisoner is indicted
    (that of 1842, chap. 272), and that the prisoner may meet his
    due reward--be that what it may.

    That there is something required to be done by our Legislators,
    for the protection of slave property, is evident from the
    variety of constructions put upon the statute in this case, and
    we trust, that at the next meeting of the Legislature there will
    be such amendments, as to make the law on this subject,
    perfectly clear and comprehensible to the understanding of every
    one.

    In the language of the assistant counsel for the State, "Slavery
    must be protected or it must be abolished."


From the same sheet, of May 20th, the terrible doom of Samuel Green, is
announced in the following words:


    In the case of the State against Sam Green, (free negro) who was
    tried at the April term of the Circuit Court of this county, for
    having in his possession abolition pamphlets, among which was
    "Uncle Tom's Cabin," has been found guilty by the court, and
    sentenced to the penitentiary for the term of ten years--until
    the 14th of May, 1867.


The son, a refugee in Canada, hearing the distressing news of his
father's sad fate in the hands of the relentless "gentlemen," often
wrote to know if there was any prospect of his deliverance. The
subjoined letter is a fair sample of his correspondence:


    SALFORD, 22,1857.

    Dear Sir I take my pen in hand to Request a faver of you if you
    can by any means without duin InJestus to your self or your
    Bisness to grant it as I Bleve you to be a man that would
    Sympathize in such a ones Condition as my self I Reseved a
    letter that Stats to me that my Fater has ben Betraed in the act
    of helping sum frend to Canada and the law has Convicted and
    Sentanced him to the Stats prison for 10 yeares his White Frands
    ofered 2 thousen Dollers to Redem him but they would not short
    three thousen. I am in Canada and it is a Dificult thing to get
    a letter to any of my Frands in Maryland so as to get prop per
    infermation abot it--if you can by any means get any in
    telligence from Baltimore City a bot this Event Plese do so and
    Rit word and all so all the inform mation that you think prop
    per as Regards the Evant and the best mathod to Redeme him and
    so Plese Rite soon as you can You will oblige your sir Frand and
    Drect your letter to Salford P. office C.W.

    SAMUEL GREEN.


In this dark hour the friends of the Slave could do but little more than
sympathize with this heart-stricken son and grey-headed father. The aged
follower of the Rejected and Crucified had like Him to bear the
"reproach of many," and make his bed with the wicked in the
Penitentiary. Doubtless there were a few friends in his neighborhood who
sympathized with him, but they were powerless to aid the old man. But
thanks to a kind Providence, the great deliverance brought about during
the Rebellion by which so many captives were freed, also unlocked Samuel
Green's prison-doors and he was allowed to go free.

After his liberation from the Penitentiary, we had from his own lips
narrations of his years of suffering--of the bitter cup, that he was
compelled to drink, and of his being sustained by the Almighty Arm--but
no notes were taken at the time, consequently we have nothing more to
add concerning him, save quite a faithful likeness.

AN IRISH GIRL'S DEVOTION TO FREEDOM.


IN LOVE WITH A SLAVE--GETS HIM OFF TO CANADA--FOLLOWS HIM--MARRIAGE, &C.
Having dwelt on the sad narratives of Samuel Green and his son in the
preceding chapter, it is quite a relief to be able to introduce a
traveler whose story contains incidents less painful to contemplate.
From the record book the following brief account is taken:

"April 27, 1855. John Hall arrived safely from Richmond, Va., per
schooner, (Captain B). One hundred dollars were paid for his passage."
In Richmond he was owned by James Dunlap, a merchant. John had been sold
several times, in consequence of which, he had possessed very good
opportunities of experiencing the effect of change of owners. Then, too,
the personal examination made before sale, and the gratification
afforded his master when he (John), brought a good price--left no very
pleasing impressions on his mind.

By one of his owners, named Burke, John alleged that he had been
"cruelly used." When quite young, both he and his sister, together with
their mother, were sold by Burke. From that time he had seen neither
mother nor sister--they were sold separately. For three or four years
the desire to seek liberty had been fondly cherished, and nothing but
the want of a favorable opportunity had deterred him from carrying out
his designs.  He considered himself much "imposed upon" by his master,
particularly as he was allowed "no choice about living" as he "desired."
This was indeed ill-treatment as John viewed the matter. John may have
wanted too much. He was about thirty-five years of age, light
complexion--tall--rather handsome-looking, intelligent, and of good
manners. But notwithstanding these prepossessing features, John's owner
valued him at only $1,000. If he had been a few shades darker and only
about half as intelligent as he was, he would have been worth at least
$500 more. The idea of having had a white father, in many instances,
depreciated the pecuniary value of male slaves, if not of the other sex.
John emphatically was one of this injured class; he evidently had blood
in his veins which decidedly warred against submitting to the yoke. In
addition to the influence which such rebellious blood exerted over him,
together with a considerable amount of intelligence, he was also under
the influence and advice of a daughter of old Ireland. She was heart and
soul with John in all his plans which looked Canada-ward. This it was
that "sent him away."

It is very certain, that this Irish girl was not annoyed by the kinks in
John's hair. Nor was she overly fastidious about the small percentage of
colored blood visible in John's complexion. It was, however, a strange
occurrence and very hard to understand. Not a stone was left unturned
until John was safely on the Underground Rail Road. Doubtless she helped
to earn the money which was paid for his passage. And when he was safe
off, it is not too much to say, that John was not a whit more delighted
than was his intended Irish lassie, Mary Weaver. John had no sooner
reached Canada than Mary's heart was there too. Circumstances, however,
required that she should remain in Richmond a number of months for the
purpose of winding up some of her affairs. As soon as the way opened for
her, she followed him. It was quite manifest, that she had not let a
single opportunity slide, but seized the first chance and arrived partly
by means of the Underground Rail Road and partly by the regular train.
Many difficulties were surmounted before and after leaving Richmond, by
which they earned their merited success. From Canada, where they
anticipated entering upon the matrimonial career with mutual
satisfaction, it seemed to afford them great pleasure to write back
frequently, expressing their heartfelt gratitude for assistance, and
their happiness in the prospect of being united under the favorable
auspices of freedom! At least two or three of these letters, bearing on
particular phases of their escape, etc., are too valuable not to be
published in this connection:



FIRST LETTER.



    HAMILTON, March 25th, 1856.

    Mr. Still:--Sir and Friend--I take the liberty of addressing you
    with these few lines hoping that you will attend to what I shall
    request of you.

    I have written to Virginia and have not received an answer yet.
    I want to know if you can get any one of your city to go to
    Richmond for me. If you can, I will pay the expense of the
    whole. The person that I want the messenger to see is a white
    girl. I expect you know who I allude to, it is the girl that
    sent me away. If you can get any one to go, you will please
    write right away and tell me the cost, &c. I will forward the
    money and a letter. Please use your endeavors.

    Yours Respectfuliy,

    JOHN HALL.

    Direct yours to Mr. Hill.




SECOND LETTER.



    HAMILTON, Sept. 15th, 1856.

    To Mr. Still, Dear Sir:--I take this opportunity of addressing
    these few lines to you hoping to find you in good health I am
    happy to inform you that Miss Weaver arrived here on Tuesday
    last, and I can assure you it was indeed a happy day. As for
    your part that you done I will not attempt to tell you how
    thankful I am, but I hope that you can imagine what my feelings
    are to you. I cannot find words sufficient to express my
    gratitude to you, I think the wedding will take place on Tuesday
    next, I have seen some of the bread from your house, and she
    says it is the best bread she has had since she has been in
    America. Sometimes she has impudence enough to tell me she would
    rather be where you are in Philadelphia than to be here with me.
    I hope this will be no admiration to you for no honest hearted
    person ever saw you that would not desire to be where you are,
    No flattery, but candidly speaking, you are worthy all the
    praise of any person who has ever been with you, I am now like a
    deserted Christian, but yet I have asked so much, and all has
    been done yet I must ask again, My love to Mrs. Still. Dear Mr.
    Still I now ask you please to exercise all your influence to get
    this young man Willis Johnson from Richmond for me It is the
    young man that Miss Weaver told you about, he is in Richmond I
    think he is at the corner of Fushien Street, & Grace in a house
    of one Mr. Rutherford, there is several Rutherford in the
    neighborhood, there is a church call'd the third Baptist Church,
    on the R.H. side going up Grace street, directly opposite the
    Baptist church at the corner, is Mrs. Meads Old School at one
    corner, and Mr. Rutherfords is at the other corner. He can be
    found out by seeing Fountain Tombs who belongs to Mr. Rutherford
    and if you should not see him, there is James Turner who lives
    at the Governors, Please to see Captain Bayliss and tell him to
    take these directions and go to John Hill, in Petersburgh, and
    he may find him. Tell Captain Bayliss that if he ever did me a
    friendly thing in his life which he did do one friendly act, if
    he will take this on himself, and if money should be lacking I
    will forward any money that he may require, I hope you will
    sympathize with the poor young fellow, and tell the captain to
    do all in his power to get him and the costs shall be paid. He
    lies now between death or victory, for I know the man he belongs
    to would just as soon kill him as not, if he catches him, I here
    enclose to you a letter for Mr. Wm. C. Mayo, and please to send
    it as directed. In this letter I have asked him to send a box to
    you for me, which you will please pay the fare of the express
    upon it, when you get it please to let me know, and I will send
    you the money to pay the expenses of the carriage clear through.
    Please to let Mr. Mayo know how to direct a box to you, and the
    best way to send it from Richmond to Philadelphia. You will
    greatly oblige me by so doing. In this letter I have enclosed a
    trifle for postage which you will please to keep on account of
    my letters I hope you wont think hard of me but I simply send it
    because I know you have done enough, and are now doing more,
    without imposing in the matter I have done it a great many more
    of our people who you have done so much fore. No more from your
    humble and oldest servant.

FOURTH LETTER.



    HAMILTON, December 23d, 1856.

    DEAR SIR:--I am happy to inform you that we are both enjoying
    good health and hope you are the same. I have been expecting a
    letter from you for some time but I suppose your business has
    prevented you from writing. I suppose you have not heard from
    any of my friends at Richmond. I have been longing to hear some
    news from that part, you may think "Out of sight and out of
    mind," but I can assure you, no matter how far I may be, or in
    what distant land, I shall never forget you, if I can never
    reach you by letters you may be sure I shall always think of
    you. I have found a great many friends in my life, but I must
    say you are the best one I ever met with, except one, you must
    know who that is, 'tis one who if I did not consider a friend, I
    could not consider any other person a friend, and that is Mrs.
    Hall. Please to let me know if the navigation between New York &
    Richmond is closed. Please to let me know whether it would be
    convenient to you to go to New York if it is please let me know
    what is the expense. Tell Mrs Still that my wife would be very
    happy to receive a letter from her at some moment when she is at
    leisure, for I know from what little I have seen of domestic
    affairs it keeps her pretty well employed, And I know she has
    not much time to write but if it were but two lines, she would
    be happy to receive it from her, my reason for wanting you to go
    to New York, there is a young man named Richard Myers and I
    should like for you to see him. He goes on board the Orono to
    Richmond and is a particular friend of mine and by seeing him I
    could get my clothes from Richmond, I expect to be out of employ
    in a few days, as the hotel is about to close on the 1st January
    and I hope you will write to me soon I want you to send me word
    how you and all the family are and all the news you can, you
    must excuse my short letter, as it is now near one o'clock and I
    must attend to business, but I have not written half what I
    intended to, as time is short, hoping to hear from you soon I
    remain yours sincerely,

    JOHN HALL.

    Mr. and Mrs. Hill desire their best respects to you and Mrs.
    Still.


It cannot be denied that this is a most extraordinary occurrence. In
some respects it is without a parallel. It was, however, no uncommon
thing for white men (slave-holders) in the South to have colored wives
and children whom, they did not hesitate to live with and acknowledge by
their actions, with their means, and in their wills as the rightful
heirs of their substance. Probably there is not a state in the Union
where such relations have not existed. Seeing such usages, Mary might
have reasoned that she had as good a right to marry the one she loved
most as anybody else, particularly as she was in a "free country."

"SAM" NIXON ALIAS DR. THOMAS BAYNE.


THE ESCAPE OF A DENTIST ON THE U.G.R.R.--HE IS TAKEN FOR AN
IMPOSTOR--ELECTED A MEMBER OF CITY COUNCIL IN NEW BEDFORD--STUDYING
MEDICINE, ETC. But few could be found among the Underground Rail Road
passengers who had a stronger repugnance to the unrequited labor system,
or the recognized terms of "master and slave," than Dr. Thomas Bayne.
Nor were many to be found who were more fearless and independent in
uttering their sentiments. His place of bondage was in the city of
Norfolk, Va., where he was held to service by Dr. C.F. Martin, a dentist
of some celebrity. While with Dr. Martin, "Sam" learned dentistry in all
its branches, and was often required by his master, the doctor, to
fulfil professional engagements, both at home and at a distance, when it
did not suit his pleasure or convenience to appear in person. In the
mechanical department, especially, "Sam" was called upon to execute the
most difficult tasks. This was not the testimony of "Sam" alone; various
individuals who were with him in Norfolk, but had moved to Philadelphia,
and were living there at the time of his arrival, being invited to see
this distinguished professional piece of property, gave evidence which
fully corroborated his. The master's professional practice, according to
"Sam's" calculation, was worth $3,000 per annum. Full $1,000 of this
amount in the opinion of "Sam" was the result of his own fettered hands.
Not only was "Sam" serviceable to the doctor in the mechanical and
practical branches of his profession, but as a sort of ready reckoner
and an apt penman, he was obviously considered by the doctor, a valuable
"article." He would frequently have "Sam" at his books instead of a
book-keeper. Of course, "Sam" had never received, from Dr. M., an hour's
schooling in his life, but having perceptive faculties naturally very
large, combined with much self-esteem, he could hardly help learning
readily. Had his master's design to keep him in ignorance been ever so
great, he would have found it a labor beyond his power. But there is no
reason to suppose that Dr. Martin was opposed to Sam's learning to read
and write. We are pleased to note that no charges of ill-treatment are
found recorded against Dr. M. in the narrative of "Sam."

True, it appears that he had been sold several times in his younger
days, and had consequently been made to feel keenly, the smarts of
Slavery, but nothing of this kind was charged against Dr. M., so that he
may be set down as a pretty fair man, for aught that is known to the
contrary, with the exception of depriving "Sam" of the just reward of
his labor, which, according to St. James, is pronounced a "fraud." The
doctor did not keep "Sam" so closely confined to dentistry and
book-keeping that he had no time to attend occasionally to outside
duties. It appears that he was quite active and successful as an
Underground Rail Road agent, and rendered important aid in various
directions. Indeed, Sam had good reason to suspect that the
slave-holders were watching him, and that if he remained, he would most
likely find himself in "hot water up to his eyes." Wisdom dictated that
he should "pull up stakes" and depart while the way was open. He knew
the captains who were then in the habit of taking similar passengers,
but he had some fears that they might not be able to pursue the business
much longer. In contemplating the change which he was about to make,
"Sam" felt it necessary to keep his movements strictly private. Not even
was he at liberty to break his mind to his wife and child, fearing that
it would do them no good, and might prove his utter failure. His wife's
name was Edna and his daughter was called Elizabeth; both were slaves
and owned by E.P. Tabb, Esq., a hardware merchant of Norfolk.

No mention is made on the books, of ill-treatment, in connection with
his wife's servitude; it may therefore be inferred, that her situation
was not remarkably hard. It must not be supposed that "Sam" was not
truly attached to his wife. He gave abundant proof of true matrimonial
devotion, notwithstanding the secrecy of his arrangements for flight.
Being naturally hopeful, he concluded that he could better succeed in
securing his wife after obtaining freedom himself, than in undertaking
the task beforehand.

The captain had two or three other Underground Rail Road male passengers
to bring with him, besides "Sam," for whom, arrangements had been
previously made--no more could be brought that trip. At the appointed
time, the passengers were at the disposal of the captain of the schooner
which was to bring them out of Slavery into freedom. Fully aware of the
dangerous consequences should he be detected, the captain, faithful to
his promise, secreted them in the usual manner, and set sail northward.
Instead of landing his passengers in Philadelphia, as was his intention,
for some reason or other (the schooner may have been disabled), he
landed them on the New Jersey coast, not a great distance from Cape
Island. He directed them how to reach Philadelphia. Sam knew of friends
in the city, and straightway used his ready pen to make known the
distress of himself and partners in tribulation. In making their way in
the direction of their destined haven, they reached Salem, New Jersey,
where they were discovered to be strangers and fugitives, and were
directed to Abigail Goodwin, a Quaker lady, an abolitionist, long noted
for her devotion to the cause of freedom, and one of the most liberal
and faithful friends of the Vigilance Committee of Philadelphia.

This friend's opportunities of witnessing fresh arrivals had been rare,
and perhaps she had never before come in contact with a "chattel" so
smart as "Sam." Consequently she was much embarrassed when she heard his
story, especially when he talked of his experience as a "Dentist." She
was inclined to suspect that he was a "shrewd impostor" that needed
"watching" instead of aiding. But her humanity forbade a hasty decision
on this point. She was soon persuaded to render him some assistance,
notwithstanding her apprehensions. While tarrying a day or two in Salem,
"Sam's" letter was received in Philadelphia. Friend Goodwin was written
to in the meantime, by a member of the Committee, directly with a view
of making inquires concerning the stray fugitives, and at the same time
to inform her as to how they happened to be coming in the direction
found by her. While the mind of the friend was much relieved by the
letter she received, she was still in some doubt, as will be seen by the
appended extract from a letter on the subject:



LETTER FROM A. GOODWIN.



    SALEM, 3 mo., 25, '55.

    DEAR FRIEND:--Thine of the 22d came to hand yesterday noon.

    I do not believe that any of them are the ones thee wrote about,
    who wanted Dr. Lundy to come for them, and promised they would
    pay his expenses. They had no money, the minister said, but were
    pretty well off for clothes. I gave him all I had and more, but
    it seemed very little for four travelers--only a dollar for
    each--but they will meet with friends and helpers on the way. He
    said they expected to go away to-morrow. I am afraid, it's so
    cold, and one of them had a sore foot, they will not get
    away--it's dangerous staying here. There has been a slave-hunter
    here lately, I was told yesterday, in search of a woman; he
    tracked her to our Alms-house--she had lately been confined and
    was not able to go--he will come back for her and his
    infant--and will not wait long I expect. I want much to get her
    away first--and if one had a C.C. Torney here no doubt it would
    be done; but she will be well guarded. How much I wish the poor
    thing could be secreted in some safe place till she is able to
    travel Northward; but where that could be it's not easy to see.
    I presume the Carolina freed people have arrived ere now. I hope
    they will meet many friends, and be well provided for. Mary
    Davis will be then paid--her cousins have sent her twenty-four
    dollars, as it was not wanted for the purchase money--it was to
    be kept for them when they arrive. I am glad thee did keep the
    ten for the fugitives.

    Samuel Nixon is now here, just come--a smart young man--they
    will be after him soon. I advise him to hurry on to Canada; he
    will leave here to-morrow, but don't say that he will go
    straight to the city. I would send this by him if he did. I am
    afraid he will loiter about and be taken--do make them go on
    fast--he has left. I could not hear much he said--some who did
    don't like him at all--think him an impostor--a great brag--said
    he was a dentist ten years. He was asked where he came from, but
    would not tell till he looked at the letter that lay on the
    table and that he had just brought back. I don't feel much
    confidence in him--don't believe he is the one thee alluded to.
    He was asked his name--he looked at the letter to find it out.
    Says nobody can make a better set of teeth than he can. He said
    they will go on to-morrow in the stage--he took down the number
    and street of the Anti-slavery office--you will be on your guard
    against imposition--he kept the letter thee sent from Norfolk. I
    had then no doubt of him, and had no objection to it. I now
    rather regret it. I would send it to thee if I had it, but
    perhaps it is of no importance.

    He wanted the names taken down of nine more who expected to get
    off soon and might come here. He told us to send them to him,
    but did not seem to know where he was going to. He was well
    dressed in fine broad-cloth coat and overcoat, and has a very
    active tongue in his head.

    But I have said enough--don't want to prejudice thee against
    him, but only be on thy guard, and do not let him deceive thee,
    as I fear he has some of us here.

    With kind regards,

    A. GOODWIN.


In due time Samuel and his companions reached Philadelphia, where a
cordial welcome awaited them. The confusion and difficulties into which
they had fallen, by having to travel an indirect route, were fully
explained, and to the hearty merriment of the Committee and strangers,
the dilemma of their good Quaker friend Goodwin at Salem was alluded to.
After a sojourn of a day or two in Philadelphia, Samuel and his
companions left for New Bedford. Canada was named to them as the safest
place for all Refugees; but it was in vain to attempt to convince "Sam"
that Canada or any other place on this Continent, was quite equal to New
Bedford. His heart was there, and there he was resolved to go--and there
he did go too, bearing with him his resolute mind, determined, if
possible, to work his way up to an honorable position at his old trade,
Dentistry, and that too for his own benefit.

Aided by the Committee, the journey was made safely to the desired
haven, where many old friends from Norfolk were found. Here our hero was
known by the name of Dr. Thomas Bayne--he was no longer "Sam." In a
short time the Dr. commenced his profession in an humble way, while, at
the same time, he deeply interested himself in his own improvement, as
well as the improvement of others, especially those who had escaped from
Slavery as he himself had. Then, too, as colored men were voters and,
therefore, eligible to office in New Bedford, the Doctor's naturally
ambitious and intelligent, turn of mind led him to take an interest in
politics, and before he was a citizen of New Bedford four years, he was
duly elected a member of the City Council. He was also an outspoken
advocate of the cause of temperance, and was likewise a ready speaker at
Anti-slavery meetings held by his race. Some idea of his abilities, and
the interest he took in the Underground Rail Road, education, etc., may
be gathered from the appended letters:


    NEW BEDFORD, June 23d, 1855.

    W. Still:--Sir--I write you this to inform you that I has
    received my things and that you need not say any thing to Bagnul
    about them--I see by the Paper that the under ground Rail Road
    is in operation. Since 2 weeks a go when Saless Party was
    betrayed by that Capt whom we in mass. are so anxious to Learn
    his name--There was others started last Saturday night--They are
    all my old friends and we are waiting their arrival, we hope you
    will look out for them they may come by way of Salem, N.J. if
    they be not overtaken. They are from Norfolk--Times are very
    hard in Canada 2 of our old friends has left Canada and come to
    Bedford for a living. Every thing are so high and wages so low
    They cannot make a living (owing to the War) others are Expected
    shortly--let me hear from Sales and his Party. Get the Name of
    the Capt. that betrayed him let me know if Mrs. Goodwin of Salem
    are at the same place yet--John Austin are with us. C. Lightfoot
    is well and remembers you and family. My business increases more
    since I has got an office. Send me a Norfolk Paper or any other
    to read when convenient.

    Let me hear from those People as soon as possible. They consist
    of woman and child 2 or 3 men belonging to Marsh Bottimore, L.
    Slosser and Herman & Co--and Turner--all of Norfolk, Va.

    Truly yours,

    THOS. BAYNE.

    Direct to Box No. 516, New Bedford, Mass. Don't direct my
    letters to my office. Direct them to my Box 516. My office is
    66-1/2 William St. The same street the Post office is near the
    city market.


The Doctor, feeling his educational deficiency in the enlightened city
of New Bedford, did just what every uncultivated man should, devoted
himself assiduously to study, and even applied himself to abstruse and
hard subjects, medicine, etc., as the following letters will show:


    NEW BEDFORD, Jan., 1860.

    No. 22, Cheapside, opposite City Hall.

    My Dear Friend:--Yours of the 3d inst. reached me safely in the
    midst of my misfortune. I suppose you have learned that my
    office and other buildings burned down during the recent fire.
    My loss is $550, insured $350.

    I would have written you before, but I have been to R.I. for
    some time and soon after I returned before I examined the books,
    the fire took place, and this accounts for my delay. In regard
    to the books I am under many obligations to you and all others
    for so great a piece of kindness, and shall ever feel indebted
    to you for the same. I shall esteem them very highly for two
    reasons, first, The way in which they come, that is through and
    by your Vigilance as a colored man helping a colored man to get
    such knowledge as will give the lie to our enemies.
    Secondly--their contents being just the thing I needed at this
    time. My indebtedness to you and all concerned for me in this
    direction is inexpressible. There are some books the Doctor says
    I must have, such as the Medical Dictionary, Physician's
    Dictionary, and a work on Anatomy. These I will have to get, but
    any work that may be of use to a student of anatomy or medicine
    will be thankfully received. You shall hear from me again soon.

    Truly Yours,

    THOS. BAYNE.





    NEW BEDFORD, March 18th, 1861.

    Mr. Wm. Still:--Dear Sir--Dr. Powell called to see me and
    informed me that you had a medical lexicon (Dictionary) for me.
    If you have such a book for me, it will be very thankfully
    received, and any other book that pertains to the medical or
    dental profession. I am quite limited in means as yet and in
    want of books to prosecute my studies. The books I need most at
    present is such as treat on midwifery, anatomy, &c. But any book
    or books in either of the above mentioned cases will be of use
    to me. You can send them by Express, or by any friend that may
    chance to come this way, but by Express will be the safest way
    to send them. Times are quite dull. This leaves me well and hope
    it may find you and family the same. My regards to your wife and
    all others.

    Yours, &c.,

    THOMAS BAYNE,

    22 Cheapside, opposite City Hall.


Thus the doctor continued to labor and improve his mind until the war
removed the hideous institution of Slavery from the nation; but as soon
as the way opened for his return to his old home, New Bedford no longer
had sufficient attractions to retain him. With all her faults he
conceived that "Old Virginia" offered decided inducements for his
return. Accordingly he went directly to Norfolk, whence he escaped. Of
course every thing was in the utmost confusion and disorder when he
returned, save where the military held sway. So as soon as the time drew
near for reorganizing, elections, &c., the doctor was found to be an
aspirant for a seat in Congress, and in "running" for it, was found to
be a very difficult candidate to beat. Indeed in the first reports of
the election his name was amongst the elected; but subsequent counts
proved him to be among the defeated by only a very slight majority.

At the time of the doctor's escape, in 1855, he was thirty-one years of
age, a man of medium size, and about as purely colored, as could readily
be found, with a full share of self-esteem and pluck.

SUNDRY ARRIVALS


FROM LOUDON CO., VA., NORFOLK, BALTIMORE, MD., PETERSBURG, VA., &C.,
ABOUT THE MONTH OF JUNE, 1855.
Arrival 1st.  David Bennett and family.
Arrival 2d.   Henry Washington, alias Anthony Hanly, and Henry Stewart.
Arrival 3d.   William Nelson and wife, William Thomas, Louisa Bell, and
Elias Jasper.
Arrival 4th.  Maria Joiner.
Arrival 5th.  Richard Green and his brother George.
Arrival 6th.  Henry Cromwell.
Arrival 7th.  Henry Bohm.
Arrival 8th.  Ralph Whiting, James H. Forman, Anthony Atkinson,
Arthur Jones, Isaiah Nixon, Joseph Harris, John Morris, Henry Hodges.
Arrival 9th.  Robert Jones and wife.




The first arrival to be here noticed consisted of David Bennett, and his
wife Martha, with their two children, a little boy named George, and a
nameless babe one month old. This family journeyed from Loudon county,
Va. David, the husband, had been in bonds under Captain James Taylor.
Martha, the wife, and her two children were owned by George Carter.
Martha's master was represented as a very barbarous and cruel man to the
slaves. He made a common practice of flogging females when stripped
naked. This was the emphatic testimony of Martha. Martha declared that
she had been so stripped, and flogged by him after her marriage. The
story of this interesting young mother, who was about twenty-seven years
of age, was painful to the ear, particularly as the earnestness and
intelligence of this poor, bruised, and mangled soul bore such strong
evidence to the truthfulness of her statements. During the painful
interview the mind would involuntarily picture this demon, only as the
representative of thousands in the South using the same relentless sway
over men and women; and this fleeing victim and her little ones, before
escaping, only as sharers of a common lot with many other mothers and
children, whose backs were daily subjected to the lash. If on such an
occasion it was hard to find fitting words of sympathy, or adequate
expressions of indignation, the pleasure of being permitted to give aid
and comfort to such was in part a compensation and a relief. David, the
husband of this woman, was about thirty-two years of age. No further
notice was made of him.



Arrival No. 2 consisted of Henry Washington, alias Anthony Hanly, and
Henry Stewart. Henry left Norfolk and a "very mild master," known by the
name of "Seth March," out of sheer disgust for the patriarchal
institution. Directly after speaking of his master in such flattering
terms he qualified the "mild," &c. by adding that he was excessively
close in money matters. In proof of this assertion, Henry declared, that
out of his hire he was only allowed $1.50 per week to pay his board,
clothe himself, and defray all other expenses; leaving no room whatever
for him to provide for his wife. It was, therefore, a never-failing
source of unhappiness to be thus debarred, and it was wholly on this
account that he "took out," as he did, and at the time that he did. His
wife's name was "Sally." She too was a slave, but "had not been treated
roughly."

For fifty long years Henry had been in the grasp of this merciless
system--constrained to toil for the happiness of others, to make them
comfortable, rich, indolent, and tyrannical. To say that he was like a
bird out of a cage, conveys in no sense whatever the slightest idea of
his delight in escaping from the prison house. And yet, his pleasure was
sadly marred by the reflection that his bosom companion was still in
bondage in the gloomy prison-house. Henry was a man of dark color, well
made, and of a reflective turn of mind. On arriving in Canada, he
manifested his gratitude through Rev. H. Wilson, as follows--


    ST. CATHARINES, Aug. 20th, 1855.

    DEAR BR. STILL:--I am requested by Henry Washington to inform
    you that he got through safe, and is here in good business. He
    returns to you his sincere thanks for your attention to him on
    his way. I had the pleasure of receiving seven fugitives last
    week. Send them on, and may God speed them in the flight. I
    would like to have a miracle-working power, that I could give
    wings to them all so that they could come faster than by
    Railroads either underground or above.

    Yours truly,

    HIRAM WILSON.


While he was thus hopefully succeeding in Canada, separated from his
companion by many hundreds of miles, death came and liberated her from
the yoke, as the subjoined letter indicates--


    ST. CATHARINES, C.W. Nov. 12, 1855.

    MR. WILLIAM STILL:--_Dear Sir_:--I have received a letter from
    Joseph G. Selden a friend in Norfolk, Va., informing me of the
    death of my wife, who deceased since I saw you here; he also
    informs me that my clothing will be forwarded to you by Jupiter
    White, who now has it in his charge. You will therefore do me a
    great favor, if you will be so good as to forward them to me at
    this place St. Catharines, C.W.

    The accompanying letter is the one received from Mr. Selden
    which I send you, that you may see that it is all right. You
    will please give my respects to Mrs. Still and family. Most
    respectfully yours,

    HENRY WASHINGTON.


Henry Stewart, who accompanied the above mentioned traveler to Canada,
had fled a short while before from Plymouth, North Carolina. James
Monroe Woodhouse, a farmer, claimed Stewart as his property, and "hired
him out" for $180 per annum. As a master, Woodhouse was considered to be
of the "moderate" type, according to Stewart's judgment. But respecting
money matters (when his slaves wanted a trifle), "he was very hard. He
did not flog, but would not give a slave a cent of money upon any
consideration."

It was by procuring a pass to Norfolk, that Henry managed to escape.
Although a father and a husband, having a wife (Martha) and two children
(Mary Ann and Susan Jane), he felt that his lot as a slave utterly
debarred him from discharging his duty to them; that he could exercise
no rights or privileges whatever, save as he might obtain permission
from his master. In the matter of separation, even although the ties of
husband and wife, parents and children were most closely knit, his
reason dictated that he would be justified in freeing himself if
possible; indeed, he could not endure the pressure of Slavery any
longer. Although only twenty-three years of age, the burdens that he had
been called upon to bear, made his naturally intelligent mind chafe to
an unusual degree, especially when reflecting upon a continued life of
Slavery. When the time decided upon for his flight arrived, he said
nothing to his wife on the subject, but secured his pass and took his
departure for Norfolk. On arriving there, he sought out an Underground
Rail Road captain, and arranged with him to bring him to Philadelphia.
Whether the sorrow-stricken wife ever afterwards heard of her husband,
or the father of his two little children, the writer is unable to say.
It is possible that this narrative may reveal to the mother and her
offspring (if they are still living), the first ray of light concerning
the missing one. Indeed it is not unreasonable to suppose, that
thousands of anxious wives, husbands and children, who have been
scattered in every direction by Slavery, will never be able to learn as
much of their lost ones as is contained in this brief account of Henry
Stewart.



Arrival No. 3, brought William Nelson, his wife, Susan, and son, William
Thomas, together with Louisa Bell, and Elias Jasper. These travelers
availed themselves of the schooner of Captain B. who allowed them to
embark at Norfolk, despite the search laws of Virginia. It hardly need
be said, however, that it was no trifling matter in those days, to evade
the law. Captains and captives, in order to succeed, found that it
required more than ordinary intelligence and courage, shrewdness and
determination, and at the same time, a very ardent appreciation of
liberty, without which, there could be no success. The simple
announcement then, that a party of this number had arrived from Norfolk,
or Richmond, or Petersburg, gave the Committee unusual satisfaction. It
made them quite sure that there was pluck and brain somewhere.

These individuals, in a particularly marked degree, possessed the
qualities that greatly encouraged the efforts of the Committee. William
Nelson, was a man of a dark chestnut color, medium size, with more than
an ordinary degree of what might be termed "mother wit." Apparently,
William possessed well settled convictions, touching the questions of
morals and religion, despite the overflowing tide of corruption and
spurious religious teachings consequent on the existing pro-slavery
usages all around him. He was a member of the Methodist Church, under
the charge of the Rev. Mr. Jones. For twenty years, William had served
in the capacity of a "packer" under Messrs. Turner and White, who held a
deed for William as their legal property. While he declared that he had
been very "tightly worked" he nevertheless admitted that he had been
dealt with in a mild manner in some respects.

For his board and clothing, William had been allowed $1.50 per week.
Truly a small sum for a hard-working man with a family--yet this was far
more than many slaves received from their masters. In view of receiving
this small pittance, he had toiled hard--doing over-work in order to
make "buckle and strap meet." Once he had been sold on the
auction-block. A sister of his had also shared the same fate. While
seriously contemplating his life as a slave, he was soon led to the
conclusion that it was his duty to bend his entire energies towards
freeing himself and his family if possible. The idea of not being able
to properly provide for his family rendered him quite unhappy; he
therefore resolved to seek a passage North, via the Underground Rail
Road. To any captain who would aid him in the matter, he resolved to
offer a large reward, and determined that the amount should only be
limited by his inability to increase it. Finally, after much anxious
preparation, agreement was entered into with Captain B., on behalf of
himself, wife, child, and Louisa Bell, which was mutually satisfactory
to all concerned, and afforded great hope to William. In due time the
agreement was carried into effect, and all arrived safely and were
delivered into the hands of the Committee in Philadelphia. The fare of
the four cost $240, and William was only too grateful to think, that a
Captain could be found who would risk his own liberty in thus aiding a
slave to freedom.

The Committee gladly gave them aid and succor, and agreed with William
that the Captain deserved all that he received for their deliverance.
The arrival of William, wife, and child in Canada was duly announced by
the agent at St. Catharines, Rev. H. Wilson, as follows:


    ST. CATHARINES, C.W., June 28th, 1855.

    MR. WM. STILL:--_My Dear Friend_:--I am happy to announce the
    safe arrival of Thomas Russell with his wife and child. They
    have just arrived. I am much pleased with their appearance. I
    shall do what I can for their comfort and encouragement. They
    stopt at Elmira from Monday night till this morning, hoping that
    Lucy Bell would come up and join them at that place. They are
    very anxious to hear from her, as they have failed of meeting
    with her on the way or finding her here in advance of them. They
    wish to hear from you as soon as you can write, and would like
    to know if you have forwarded Lucy on, and if so, what route you
    sent her. They send their kind respects to you and your family
    and many thanks for your kindness to them.

    They wish you to inquire after Lucy if any harm has befallen her
    after her leaving Philadelphia. Please write promptly in my
    care.

    Yours truly in the love of freedom,

    HIRAM WILSON.


The man who came to us as Wm. Nelson, is now known only as "Thomas
Russell." It may here be remarked, that, owing to the general custom of
changing names, as here instanced, it is found difficult to tell to whom
the letters severally refer. Where the old and new names were both
carefully entered on the book there is no difficulty, of course, but it
was not always thus.

Susan Bell, the wife of William, was about thirty years of age, of a
dark color, rather above medium size, well-made, good-looking, and
intelligent--quite equal to her husband, and appeared to have his
affections undividedly. She was owned by Thomas Baltimore, with whom she
had lived for the last seven years. She stated that during a part of her
life she had been treated in a "mild manner." She had no complaint to
make until after the marriage of her master. Under the new wife and
mistress, Susan found a very marked change for the worse. She fared
badly enough then. The mistress, on every trifling occasion for
complaint, was disposed to hold the auction-block up to Susan, and would
likewise influence her husband to do the same. From the fact, that four
of Susan's sisters had been sold away to "parts unknown," she was not
prepared to relish these almost daily threats from her irritable
mistress, so she became as anxious for a trip on the Underground Rail
Road as was her husband.

About one hundred miles away in the country, her father, mother, three
brothers, and one sister were living; but she felt that she could not
remain a slave on their account. Susan's owner had already fixed a price
on her and her child, twenty-two months old, which was one thousand
dollars. From this fate she was saved only by her firm resolution to
seek her freedom.

Louisa Bell was also of Wm. Nelson's party, and a fair specimen of a
nice-looking, wide awake woman; of a chestnut color, twenty-eight years
of age. She was the wife of a free man, but the slave of L. Stasson, a
confectioner. The almost constant ringing in her ears of the
auction-block, made her most miserable, especially as she had once
suffered terribly by being sold, and had likewise seen her mother, and
five sisters placed in the same unhappy situation, the thought of which
never ceased to be most painful. In reflecting upon the course which she
was about to pursue in order to free herself from the prison-house, she
felt more keenly than ever for her little children, and readily imagined
how sadly she would mourn while thinking of them hundreds of miles
distant, growing up only to be slaves. And particularly would her
thoughts dwell upon her boy, six years of age; full old enough to feel
deeply the loss of his mother, but without hope of ever seeing her
again.

Heart-breaking as were these reflections, she resolved to leave Robert
and Mary in the hands of God, and escape, if possible from her terrible
thraldom. Her plan was submitted to her husband; he acquiesced fully and
promised to follow her as soon as an opportunity might present itself.
Although the ordeal that she was called upon to pass through was of the
most trying nature she bravely endured the journey through to Canada. On
her arrival there the Rev. H. Wilson wrote on behalf of herself, and the
cause as follows:


    ST. CATHERINES, C.W. July 6th, 1855.

    DEAR BR. STILL:--I have just received your letters touching
    U.G.R.R. operations. All is right. Jasper and Mrs. Bell got here
    on Saturday last, and I think I dropt you a line announcing the
    fact. I write again thus soon because two more by name of Smith,
    John and Wm., have arrived the present week and were anxious to
    have me inform you that they are safely landed and free in this
    refuge land. They wish me to communicate their kind regards to
    you and others who have aided them. They have found employment
    and are likely to do well. The 5 of last week have gone over to
    Toronto. I gave them letters to a friend there after furnishing
    them as well as I could with such clothing as they required. I
    am afraid that I am burdening you too much with postage, but
    can't help doing so unless I fail to write at all, as my means
    are not half equal to the expenses to which I am subject.

    Faithfully and truly yours,

    HIRAM WILSON.


Elias Jasper, who was also a fellow-passenger with Wm. Nelson and Co.,
was noticed thus on the Underground Rail Road: Age thirty-two years,
color dark, features good, and gifted both with his tongue and hands. He
had worked more or less at the following trades: Rope-making,
carpentering, engineering, and photographing. It was in this latter
calling that he was engaged when the Underground Rail Road movement
first arrested his attention, and so continued until his departure.

For several years he had been accustomed to hire his time, for which he
had been required to pay $10 per month. In acquiring the above trades he
had been at no expense to his master, as he had learned them solely by
his own perseverance, endowed as he was with a considerable share of
genius. Occasionally he paid for lessons, the money being earned by his
over-work. His master, Bayham, was a "retired gentleman."

Elias had been sold once, and had suffered in various other ways,
particularly from being flogged. He left his wife, Mary, but no child.
Of his intention to leave Elias saw not how to impart to his wife, lest
she should in some way let the "cat out of the bag." She was owned by a
Miss Portlock, and had been treated "tolerably well," having had the
privilege of hiring her time. She had $55 to pay for this favor, which
amount she raised by washing, etc. Elias was a member of the Methodist
Church, as were all of his comrades, and well did they remember the
oft-repeated lesson, "Servants obey your masters," etc. They soon
understood this kind of preaching after breathing free air. The market
value of Elias was placed at $1200.



Arrival, No. 4. Maria Joiner. Captain F. arrived, from Norfolk, with the
above named passenger, the way not being open to risk any other on that
occasion. This seemed rather slow business with this voyager, for he was
usually accustomed to bringing more than one. However, as this arrival
was only one day later than the preceding one noticed, and came from the
same place, the Committee concluded, that they had much reason for
rejoicing nevertheless. As in the case of a great number among the
oppressed of the South, when simply looking at Maria, no visible marks
of ill usage in any way were discernible. Indeed, as she then appeared
at the age of thirty-three, a fine, fresh, and healthy-looking mulatto
woman, nine out of every ten would have been impressed with the idea,
that she had never been subjected to hard treatment; in other words,
that she had derived her full share of advantages from the "Patriarchal
Institution." The appearance of just such persons in Southern cities had
often led Northerners, when traveling in those parts, to regard the lot
of slaves as quite comfortable. But the story of Maria, told in an
earnest and intelligent manner, was at once calculated to dissipate the
idea of a "comfortable" existence in a state of bondage. She frankly
admitted, however, that prior to the death of her old master, she was
favorably treated, compared with many others; but, unfortunately, after
his death, she had fallen into the hands of one of the old man's
daughters, from whom, she declared, that she had received continued
abuse, especially when said daughter was under the influence of liquor.
At such times she was very violent. Being spirited, Maria could not
consent to suffer on as a slave in this manner. Consequently she began
to cogitate how she might escape from her mistress (Catharine Gordon),
and reach a free State. None other than the usual trying and hazardous
ways could be devised--which was either to be stowed away in the hold of
a schooner, or concealed amongst the rubbish of a steamer, where, for
the time being, the extreme suffering was sure to tax every nerve even
of the most valiant-hearted men. The daily darkening prospects
constrained her to decide, that she was willing to suffer, not only in
adopting this mode of travel, but on the other hand, that she had better
be dead than remain under so cruel a woman as her mistress. Maria's
husband and sister (no other relatives are noticed), were naturally
formidable barriers in the way of her escape. Notwithstanding her
attachment to them, she fully made up her mind to be free. Immediately
she took the first prerequisite step, which was to repair to a place of
concealment with a friend in the city, and there, like the man at the
pool, wait until her turn came to be conveyed thence to a free State. In
this place she was obliged to wait eight long months, enduring daily
suffering in various ways, especially during the winter season. But,
with martyr-like faith, she endured to the end, and was eventually saved
from the hell of Slavery. Maria was appraised at $800.



Arrival No. 5. Richard Green, alias Wm. Smith, and his brother George.
These young brothers fled from George Chambers of Baltimore. The elder
brother was twenty-five, the younger twenty-three. Both were tall and
well made and of a chestnut color, and possessed a good degree of
natural ability. When desiring to visit their parents, their request was
positively refused by their owner. Taking offence at this step, both
mutually resolved to run away at the earliest opportunity. Thus in
accordance with well premeditated plans, they set out and unobstructedly
arrived in Philadelphia. At first it was simply very pleasant to take
them by the hand and welcome them; then to listen for a few moments to
their intelligent narration of how they escaped, the motives that
prompted them, etc. But further inquiries soon brought out incidents of
the most thrilling and touching nature--not with regard to hardships
which they had personally experienced, but in relation to outrages which
had been perpetrated upon their mother. Such simple facts as were then
written are substantially as follows: Nearly thirty years prior to the
escape of Richard and his brother their mother was in very bad health,
so much so that physicians regarded her incurable. Her owner was
evidently fully impressed with the belief that instead of being
profitable to him, she might be an expense, which he could not possibly
obviate, while he retained her as a slave. Now there was a way to get
out of this dilemma. He could emancipate her and throw the
responsibility of her support upon, herself. Accordingly he drew up
papers, called for his wife's mother to witness them, then formally put
them into the hands of the invalid slave woman (Dinah), assuring her at
the same time, that she was free--being fully released as set forth in
her papers. "Take notice I have no more claim on you nor you on me from
this time." Marvellous liberality! After working the life out of a
woman, in order that he should not have her to bury, he becomes hastily
in favor of freedom. He is, however, justified by the laws of Maryland.
Complaint, therefore, would simply amount to nothing. In the nature of
the case Dinah was now free, but she was not wholly alone in the world.
She had a husband, named Jacob Green, who was owned by Nathan Childs for
a term of years only, at the expiration of which time he was to be free.
All lived then in Talbot county, Md. At the appointed time Jacob's
bondage ended, and he concluded that he might succeed better by moving
to Baltimore. Indeed the health of his wife was so miserable that
nothing in his old home seemed to offer any inducement in the way of a
livelihood. So off they moved to Baltimore. After a time, under careful
and kind treatment, the faithful Jacob was greatly encouraged by
perceiving that the health of his companion was gradually
improving--signs indicated, that she might yet become a well woman. The
hopes of husband and wife, in this particular, were, in the lapse of
time, fully realized. Dinah was as well as ever, and became the mother
of another child--a little boy. Everything seemed to be going on
happily, and they had no apparent reason to suspect any troubles other
than such as might naturally have to be encountered in a state of
poverty and toil.

The unfettered boy was healthy, and made rapid advance in a few years.
That any one should ever claim him was never for a moment feared.

The old master, however, becoming tired of country life, had also moved
to Baltimore. How, they knew not, but he had heard of the existence of
this boy.

That he might satisfy himself on this point, he one day very slyly
approached the house with George. No sooner was the old man within the
enclosures than he asked Dinah, "Whose child is that?" pointing to the
boy. "Ask Jacob," was the reply of the mother. The question was then put
to Jacob, the father of the boy. "I did not think that you would ask
such a question, or that you would request anything like that," Jacob
remarked, naturally somewhat nervous, but he added, "I have the
privilege of having any one I please in my house." "Where is he from?"
again demanded the master. The father repeated, "I have a right to
have," etc., "I am my own man," etc. "I have found out whose he is," the
hunter said. "I am going presently to take him home with me." At this
juncture he seized the little fellow, at the same time calling out,
"Dinah, put his clothes on." By this time the father too had seized hold
of the child. Mustering courage, the father said, "Take notice that you
are not in the country, pulling and hauling people about." "I will have
him or I will leave my heart's blood in the house," was the savage
declaration of the master. In his rage he threatened to shoot the
father. In the midst of the excitement George called in two officers to
settle the trouble. "What are you doing here?" said the officers to the
slave-holder. "I am after my property--this boy," he exclaimed. "Have
you ever seen it before?" they inquired. "No," said the slave-holder.
"Then how do you know that he belongs to you?" inquired the officers. "I
believe he is mine," replied the slave-holder.

All the parties concerned were then taken by the officers before an
Alderman. The father owned the child but the mother denied it. The
Alderman then decided that the child should be given to the father.

The slave-holder having thus failed, was unwilling, nevertheless, to
relinquish his grasp. Whereupon he at once claimed the mother. Of course
he was under the necessity of resorting to the Courts in order to
establish his claim. Fortunately the mother had securely preserved the
paper given her by her master so many years before, releasing her.
Notwithstanding this the suit was pending nearly a year before the case
was decided. Everything was so clear the mother finally gained the suit.
This decision was rendered only about two months prior to the escape of
Richard and George.



Arrival No. 6. Henry Cromwell. This passenger fled from Baltimore
county, Md. The man that he escaped from was a farmer by the name of
William Roberts, who also owned seven other young slaves. Of his
treatment of his slaves nothing was recorded.

Henry was about six feet high, quite black, visage thin, age
twenty-five. He left neither wife, parents, brothers nor sisters to
grieve after him. In making his way North he walked of nights from his
home to Harrisburg, Pa., and there availed himself of a passage on a
freight car coming to Philadelphia.



Arrival No. 7. Henry Bohm. Henry came from near Norfolk, Va. He was
about twenty-five years of age, and a fair specimen of a stout man,
possessed of more than ordinary physical strength. As to whom he fled
from, how he had been treated, or how he reached Philadelphia, the
record book is silent. Why this is the case cannot now be accounted for,
unless the hurry of getting him off forbade sufficient delay to note
down more of the particulars.



Arrival No. 8. Ralph Whiting, James H. Forman, Anthony Atkinson, Arthur
Jones, Isaiah Nixon, Joseph Harris, John Morris, and Henry Hodges. A
numerous party like this had the appearance of business. They were all
young and hopeful, and belonged to the more intelligent and promising of
their race. They were capable of giving the best of reasons for the
endeavors they were making to escape to a free country.

They imparted to the Committee much information respecting their several
situations, together with the characters of their masters in relation to
domestic matters, and the customs and usages under which they had been
severally held to service--all of which was listened to with deep
interest. But it was not an easy matter, after having been thus
entertained, to write out the narratives of eight such persons. Hundreds
of pages would hardly have contained a brief account of the most
interesting portion of their histories. It was deemed sufficient to
enter their names and their forsaken homes, etc., as follows:

"Ralph was twenty-six years of age, five feet ten inches high, dark,
well made, intelligent, and a member of the Methodist Church. He was
claimed by Geo. W. Kemp, Esq., cashier of the Exchange Bank of Norfolk,
Va. Ralph gave Mr. Kemp the credit of being a 'moderate man' to his
slaves. Ralph was compelled to leave his wife, Lydia, and two children,
Anna Eliza, and Cornelius."

"James was twenty-three years of age, dark mulatto, nearly six feet
high, and of prepossessing appearance. He fled from James Saunders, Esq.
Nothing, save the desire to be free, prompted James to leave his old
situation and master. His parents and two sisters he was obliged to
leave in Norfolk."

Two brief letters from James, one concerning his "sweet-heart," whom he
left in Norfolk, the other giving an account of her arrival in Canada
and marriage thereafter will, doubtless, be read with interest. They are
here given as follows:

    JAMES H. FORMAN.

    Direct your letter to the International Hotel, Niagara Falls.


Anthony was thirty-six years of age, and by blood, was quite as nearly
related to the Anglo-Saxon as the Anglo-African. He was nevertheless,
physically a fine specimen of a man. He was about six feet high, and
bore evidence of having picked up a considerable amount of intelligence
considering his opportunities. He had been sold three times. Anthony was
decidedly opposed to having to pass through this ordeal a fourth time,
therefore, the more he meditated over his condition, the more determined
he became to seek out an Underground Rail Road agent, and make his way
to Canada.

Concluding that Josiah Wells, who claimed him, had received a thousand
times too much of his labor already, Anthony was in a fit state of mind
to make a resolute effort to gain his freedom. He had a wife, but no
children. His father, one sister, and two brothers were all dear to him,
but all being slaves "one could not help the other," Anthony reasoned,
and wisely too. So, at the command of the captain, he was ready to bear
his part of the suffering consequent upon being concealed in the hold of
a vessel, where but little air could penetrate.

Arthur was forty-one years of age, six feet high--chestnut color, well
made, and possessed good native faculties needing cultivation. He
escaped from a farmer, by the name of John Jones, who was classed, as to
natural temperament, amongst "moderate slave-holders."

"I wanted my liberty," said Arthur promptly and emphatically, and he
declared that was the cause of his escape. He left his mother, two
sisters, and three brothers in Slavery.

Isaiah was about twenty-two, small of stature, but smart, and of a
substantially black complexion. He had been subjected to very hard
treatment under Samuel Simmons who claimed him, and on this account he
was first prompted to leave. His mother and three brothers he left in
bondage.

Joseph was twenty-three years of age, and was, in every way,
"likely-looking." According to the laws of Slavery, he was the property
of David Morris, who was entitled to be ranked amongst the more
compassionate slave-holders of the South. Yet, Joseph was not satisfied,
deprived of his freedom. He had not known hardships as many had, but it
was not in him notwithstanding, to be contented as a slave. In leaving,
he had to "tear himself away" from his parents, three brothers, and two
sisters.

Henry escaped from S. Simmons of Plymouth, North Carolina, and was a
fellow-servant with Isaiah. Simmons was particularly distinguished for
his tyrannical rule and treatment of his slaves--so Henry and Isaiah had
the good sense to withdraw from under his yoke, very young in life;
Henry being twenty-three.

John was about twenty-one years of age, five feet eight inches high,
dark color, and well-grown for his years. Before embarking, he had
endured seven months of hard suffering from being secreted, waiting for
an opportunity to escape. It was to keep his master from selling him,
that he was thus induced to secrete himself. After he had remained away
some months, he resolved to suffer on until his friends could manage to
procure him a passage on the Underground Rail Road. With this determined
spirit he did not wait in vain.



Arrival No. 9. Robert Jones and wife:--In the majority of cases, in
order to effect the escape of either, sad separations between husbands
and wives were unavoidable. Fortunately, it was not so in this case. In
journeying from the house of bondage, Robert and his wife were united
both in sympathies and in struggles. Robert had experienced "hard times"
just in what way, however, was not recorded; his wife had been
differently treated, not being under the same taskmaster as her husband.
At the time of their arrival all that was recorded of their bondage is
as follows--

August 2d, 1855, Robert Jones and wife, arrived from Petersburg, Va.
Robert is about thirty-five, chestnut color, medium size, of good
manners, intelligent, had been owned by Thomas N. Lee, "a very hard
man." Robert left because he "wanted his liberty--always had from a
boy." Eliza, his wife, is about forty years of age, chestnut color,
nice-looking, and well-dressed. She belonged to Eliza H. Richie, who was
called a "moderate woman" towards her slaves. Notwithstanding the
limited space occupied in noting them on the record book, the Committee
regarded them as being among the most worthy and brave travelers passing
over the Underground Rail Road, and felt well satisfied that such
specimens of humanity would do credit in Canada, not only to themselves,
but to their race.

Robert had succeeded in learning to read and write tolerably well, and
had thought much over the condition and wrongs of the race, and seemed
to be eager to be where he could do something to lift his
fellow-sufferers up to a higher plane of liberty and manhood. After an
interview with Robert and his wife, in every way so agreeable, they were
forwarded on in the usual manner, to Canada. While enjoying the sweets
of freedom in Canada, he was not the man to keep his light under a
bushel. He seemed to have a high appreciation of the potency of the pen,
and a decidedly clear idea that colored men needed to lay hold of many
enterprises with resolution, in order to prove themselves qualified to
rise equally with other branches of the human family. Some of his
letters, embracing his views, plans and suggestions, were so encouraging
and sensible, that the Committee was in the habit of showing them to
friendly persons, and indeed, extracts of some of his letters were
deemed of sufficient importance to publish. One alone, taken from many
letters received from him, must here suffice to illustrate his
intelligence and efforts as a fugitive and citizen in Canada.


    Hamilton, C.W., August 9th, 1856.

    MR. WM. STILL;--_Dear Friend_:--I take this opportunity of
    writing you these few lines to inform you of my health, which is
    good at present, &c. * * * *

    I was talking to you about going to Liberia, when I saw you
    last, and did intend to start this fall, but I since looked at
    the condition of the colored people in Canada. I thought I would
    try to do something for their elevation as a nation, to place
    them in the proper position to stand where they ought to stand.
    In order to do this, I have undertaken to get up a military
    company amongst them. They laughed at me to undertake such a
    thing; but I did not relax my energies. I went and had an
    interview with Major J.T. Gilepon, told him what my object was,
    he encouraged me to go on, saying that he would do all he could
    for the accomplishment of my object. He referred to _Sir Allan
    McNab, &c._ * * * * I took with me Mr. J.H. Hill to see him--he
    told me that it should be done, and required us to write a
    petition to the _Governor General_, which has been done. * * * *
    The company is already organized. Mr. Howard was elected
    Captain; J.H. Hill, 1st Lieutenant; Hezekiah Hill, Ensign;
    Robert Jones, 1st Sergeant. The company's name is, Queen
    Victoria's Rifle Guards. You may, by this, see what I have been
    doing since I have been in Canada. When we receive our
    appointments by the Government. I will send by express, my
    daguerreotype in uniform.

    My respects, &c. &c., Robert Jones.



       *       *       *       *       *




HEAVY REWARD.



    Two Thousand Six Hundred Dollars Reward--Ran away from the
    subscriber, on Saturday night, November 15th, 1856, Josiah and
    William Bailey, and Peter Pennington. Joe is about 5 feet 10
    inches in height, of a chestnut color, bald head, with a
    remarkable scar on one of his cheeks, not positive on which it
    is, but think it is on the left, under the eye, has intelligent
    countenance, active, and well-made. He is about 28 years old.
    Bill is of a darker color, about 5 feet 8 inches in height,
    stammers a little when confused, well-made, and older than Joe,
    well dressed, but may have pulled kearsey on over their other
    clothes. Peter is smaller than either the others, about 25 years
    of age, dark chestnut color, 5 feet 7 or 8 inches high.

    [Illustration: ]

    A reward of fifteen hundred dollars will be given to any person
    who will apprehend the said Joe Bailey, and lodge him safely in
    the jail at Easton, Talbot Co., Md., and $300 for Bill and $800
    for Peter.

    W.R. Hughlett

    John C. Henry,

    T. Wright.


When this arrival made its appearance, it was at first sight quite
evident that one of the company was a man of more than ordinary parts,
both physically and mentally. Likewise, taking them individually, their
appearance and bearing tended largely to strengthen the idea that the
spirit of freedom was rapidly gaining ground in the minds of the slaves,
despite the efforts of the slave-holders to keep them in darkness. In
company with the three men, for whom the above large reward was offered,
came a woman by the name of Eliza Nokey.

As soon as the opportunity presented itself, the Active Committee
feeling an unusual desire to hear their story, began the investigation
by inquiring as to the cause of their escape, etc., which brought simple
and homely but earnest answers from each. These answers afforded the
best possible means of seeing Slavery in its natural, practical
workings--of obtaining such testimony and representations of the vile
system, as the most eloquent orator or able pen might labor in vain to
make clear and convincing, although this arrival had obviously been
owned by men of high standing. The fugitives themselves innocently
stated that one of the masters, who was in the habit of flogging adult
females, was a "moderate man." Josiah Bailey was the leader of this
party, and he appeared well-qualified for this position. He was about
twenty-nine years of age, and in no particular physically, did he seem
to be deficient. He was likewise civil and polite in his manners, and a
man of good common sense. He was held and oppressed by William H.
Hughlett, a farmer and dealer in ship timber, who had besides invested
in slaves to the number of forty head. In his habits he was generally
taken for a "moderate" and "fair" man, "though he was in the habit of
flogging the slaves--females as well as males," after they had arrived
at the age of maturity. This was not considered strange or cruel in
Maryland. Josiah was the "foreman" on the place, and was entrusted with
the management of hauling the ship-timber, and through harvesting and
busy seasons was required to lead in the fields. He was regarded as one
of the most valuable hands in that part of the country, being valued at
$2,000. Three weeks before he escaped, Joe was "stripped naked," and
"flogged" very cruelly by his master, simply because he had a dispute
with one of the fellow-servants, who had stolen, as Joe alleged, seven
dollars of his hard earnings. This flogging, produced in Joe's mind, an
unswerving determination to leave Slavery or die: to try his luck on the
Underground Rail Road at all hazards. The very name of Slavery, made the
fire fairly burn in his bones. Although a married man, having a wife and
three children (owned by Hughlett), he was not prepared to let his
affection for them keep him in chains--so Anna Maria, his wife, and his
children Ellen, Anna Maria, and Isabella, were shortly widowed and
orphaned by the slave lash.

William Bailey was owned by John C. Henry, a large slave-holder, and a
very "hard" one, if what William alleged of him was true. His story
certainly had every appearance of truthfulness. A recent brutal flogging
had "stiffened his back-bone," and furnished him with his excuse for not
being willing to continue in Maryland, working his strength away to
enrich his master, or the man who claimed to be such. The memorable
flogging, however, which caused him to seek flight on the Underground
Rail Road, was not administered by his master or on his master's
plantation. He was hired out, and it was in this situation that he was
so barbarously treated. Yet he considered his master more in fault than
the man to whom he was hired, but redress there was none, save to
escape.

The hour for forwarding the party by the Committee, came too soon to
allow time for the writing of any account of Peter Pennington and Eliza
Nokey. Suffice it to say, that in struggling through their journey,
their spirits never flagged; they had determined not to stop short of
Canada. They truly had a very high appreciation of freedom, but a very
poor opinion of Maryland.

SLAVE TRADER HALL IS FOILED.


ROBERT McCOY _alias_ WILLIAM DONAR.

In October, 1854, the Committee received per steamer, directly from
Norfolk, Va., Robert McCoy and Elizabeth Saunders. Robert had constantly
been in the clutches of the negro-trader Hall, for the last sixteen
years, previous to his leaving, being owned by him. He had, therefore,
possessed very favorable opportunities for varied observation and
experience relative to the trader's conduct in his nefarious business,
as well as for witnessing the effects of the auction-block upon all
ages--rending asunder the dearest ties, despite the piteous wails of
childhood or womanhood, parental or conjugal relations. But no attempt
will be made to chronicle the deeds of this dealer in human flesh. Those
stories fresh from the lips of one who had just escaped, were painful in
the extreme, but in the very nature of things some of the statements are
too revolting to be published. In lieu of this fact, except the above
allusions to the trader's business, this sketch will only refer to
Robert's condition as a slave, and finally as a traveler on the
Underground Rail Road.

Robert was a man of medium size, dark mulatto, of more than ordinary
intelligence. His duties had been confined to the house, and not to the
slave pen. As a general thing, he had managed, doubtless through much
shrewdness, to avoid very severe outrages from the trader. On the whole,
he had fared "about as well" as the generality of slaves.

Yet, in order to free himself from his "miserable" life, he was willing,
as he declared, to suffer almost any sacrifice. Indeed, his conduct
proved the sincerity of this declaration, as he had actually been
concealed five months in a place in the city, where he could not
possibly avoid daily suffering of the most trying kind. His resolve to
be free was all this while maturing. The trader had threatened to sell
Robert, and to prevent it Robert (thus) "took out." Successfully did he
elude the keen scent and grasp of the hunters, who made diligent efforts
to recapture him. Although a young man--only about twenty-eight years of
age, his health was by no means good. His system had evidently been
considerably shattered by Slavery, and symptoms of consumption, together
with chronic rheumatism, were making rapid headway against the physical
man. Under his various ills, he declared, as did many others from the
land of bondage, that his faith in God afforded him comfort and hope. He
was obliged to leave his wife, Eliza, in bonds, not knowing whether they
should ever meet again on earth, but he was somewhat hopeful that the
way would open for her escape also.

After reaching Philadelphia, where his arrival had long been anticipated
by the Vigilance Committee, his immediate wants were met, and in due
order he was forwarded to New Bedford, where, he was led to feel, he
would be happy in freedom.

Scarcely had he been in New Bedford one month, before his prayers and
hopes were realized with regard to the deliverance of his wife. On
hearing of the good news of her coming he wrote as follows--


    NEW BEDFORD, Nov. 3, 1859.

    DEAR SIR:--i embrace this opertunity to inform you that i
    received your letter with pleasure, i am enjoying good health
    and hope that these few lines will find you enjoying the same
    blessing. i rejoise to hear from you i feel very much indetted
    to you for not writing before but i have been so bissy that is
    the cause, i rejoise to heare of the arrival of my wife, and
    hope she is not sick from the roling of the sea and if she is
    not, pleas to send her on here Monday with a six baral warlian
    and a rifall to gard her up to my residance i thank you kindly
    for the good that you have don for me. Give my respects to Mrs.
    Still, tell her i want to see her very bad and you also i would
    come but i am afraid yet to venture, i received your letter the
    second, but about the first of spring i hope to pay you a visit
    or next summer. i am getting something to do every day. i will
    write on her arrivall and tell you more. Mr. R. White sends his
    love to you and your famerly and says that he is very much
    indetted to you for his not writing and all so he desires to
    know wheather his cloths has arived yet or not, and if they are
    please to express them on to him or if at preasant by Mrs.
    Donar. Not any more at preasent. i remain your affectionate
    brother,

    WILLIAM DONAR.


By the same arrival, and similarly secreted, Elizabeth Frances, alias
Ellen Saunders, had the good luck to reach Philadelphia. She was a
single young woman, about twenty-two, with as pleasant a countenance as
one would wish to see. Her manners were equally agreeable. Perhaps her
joy over her achieved victory added somewhat to her personal appearance.
She had, however, belonged to the more favored class of slaves. She had
neither been over-worked nor badly abused. Elizabeth was the property of
a lady a few shades lighter than herself, (Elizabeth was a mulatto) by
the name of Sarah Shephard, of Norfolk. In order the more effectually to
profit by Elizabeth's labor, the mistress resorted to the plan of hiring
her out for a given sum per month. Against this usage Elizabeth urged no
complaint. Indeed the only very serious charge she brought was to the
effect, that her mistress sold her mother away from her far South, when
she was a child only ten years old. She had also sold a brother and
sister to a foreign southern market. The reflections consequent upon the
course that her mistress had thus pursued, awakened Elizabeth to much
study relative to freedom, and by the time that she had reached
womanhood she had very decided convictions touching her duty with regard
to escaping. Thus growing to hate slavery in every way and manner, she
was prepared to make a desperate effort to be free. Having saved
thirty-five dollars by rigid economy, she was willing to give every cent
of it (although it was all she possessed), to be aided from Norfolk to
Philadelphia. After reaching the city, having suffered severely while
coming, she was invited to remain until somewhat recruited. In the
healthy air of freedom she was soon fully restored, and ready to take
her departure for New Bedford, which place she reached without
difficulty and was cordially welcomed. The following letter, expressive
of her obligations for aid received, was forwarded soon after her
arrival in New Bedford:


    NEW BEDFORD, Mass., October 16th, 1854.

    MR. STILL:--Dear Sir--I now take my pen in my hand to inform you
    of my health which is good at present all except a cold I have
    got but I hope when these few lines reach you you may be
    enjoying good health. I arrived in New Bedford Thursday morning
    safely and what little I have seen of the city I like it very
    much my friends were very glad to see me. I found my sister very
    well. Give my love to Mrs. Still and also your dear little
    children. I am now out at service. I do not think of going to
    Canada now. I think I shall remain in this city this winter.
    Please tell Mrs. Still I have not met any person who has treated
    me any kinder than she did since I left. I consider you both to
    have been true friends to me. I hope you will think me the same
    to you. I feel very thankful to you indeed. It might been
    supposed, out of sight out of mind, but it is not so. I never
    forget my friends. Give my love to Florence. If you come to this
    city I would be very happy to see you. Kiss your dear little
    children for me. Please to answer this as soon as possible, so
    that I may know you received this. No more at present. I still
    remain your friend,

    ELLEN SAUNDERS.



ELIZA MCCOY--the wife of Robert McCoy, whose narrative has just been
given--and who was left to wait in hope when her husband escaped--soon
followed him to freedom. It is a source of great satisfaction to be able
to present her narrative in so close proximity to her husband's. He
arrived about the first of October--she about the first of November,
following. From her lips testimony of much weight and interest was
listened to by several friends relative to her sufferings as a slave--on
the auction-block, and in a place of concealment seven months, waiting
and praying for an opportunity to escape. But it was thought sufficient
to record merely a very brief outline of her active slave life, which
consisted of the following noticeable features.

Eliza had been owned by Andrew Sigany, of Norfolk--age about
thirty-eight--mulatto, and a woman whose appearance would readily
command attention and respect anywhere outside of the barbarism of
Slavery. She stated that her experience as a sufferer in cruel hands had
been very trying, and that in fretting under hardships, she had "always
wanted to be free." Her language was unmistakable on this point. Neither
mistress nor servant was satisfied with each other; the mistress was so
"queer" and "hard to please," that Eliza became heartily sick of trying
to please her--an angel would have failed with such a woman. So, while
matters were getting no better, but, on the contrary, were growing worse
and worse, Eliza thought she would seek a more pleasant atmosphere in
the North. In fact she felt that it would afford her no little relief to
allow her place to be occupied by another. When she went into close
quarters of concealment, she fully understood what was meant and all the
liabilities thereto. She had pluck enough to endure unto the end without
murmuring. The martyrs in olden times who dwelt in "dens and caves of
the earth," could hardly have fared worse than some of these way-worn
travelers.

After the rest, needed by one who had suffered so severely until her
arrival in Philadelphia, she was forwarded to her anxiously waiting
husband in New Bedford, where she was gladly received.

From the frequent arrivals from Virginia, especially in steamers, it may
be thought that no very stringent laws or regulations existed by which
offenders, who might aid the Underground Rail Road, could be severely
punished--that the slave-holders were lenient, indifferent and unguarded
as to how this property took wings and escaped. In order to enlighten
the reader with regard to this subject, it seems necessary, in this
connection, to publish at least one of the many statutes from the slave
laws of the South bearing directly on the aid and escape of slaves by
vessels. The following enactment is given as passed by the Legislature
of Virginia in 1856:




    THE PROTECTION OF SLAVE PROPERTY IN VIRGINIA.


    A BILL PROVIDING ADDITIONAL PROTECTION FOR THE SLAVE PROPERTY OF
    CITIZENS OF THIS COMMONWEALTH.


    (1.) Be it enacted, by the General Assembly, that it shall not
    be lawful for any vessel, of any size or description, whatever,
    owned in whole, or in part, by any citizen or resident of
    another State, and about to sail or steam for any port or place
    in this State, for any port or place north of and beyond the
    capes of Virginia, to depart from the waters of this
    commonwealth, until said vessel has undergone the inspection
    hereinafter provided for in this act, and received a certificate
    to that effect. If any such vessel shall depart from the State
    without such certificate of inspection, the captain or owner
    thereof, shall forfeit and pay the sum of five hundred dollars,
    to be recovered by any person who will sue for the same, in any
    court of record in this State, in the name of the Governor of
    the Commonwealth. Pending said suit, the vessel of said captain
    or owner shall not leave the State until bond be given by the
    captain or owner, or other person for him, payable to the
    Governor, with two or three sureties satisfactory to the court,
    in the penalty of one thousand dollars, for the payment of the
    forfeit or fine, together with the cost and expenses incurred in
    enforcing the same; and in default of such bond, the vessel
    shall be held liable. Provided that nothing contained in this
    section, shall apply to vessels belonging to the United States
    Government, or vessels, American or foreign, bound direct to any
    foreign country other than the British American Provinces.

    (2.) The pilots licensed under the laws of Virginia, and while
    attached to a vessel regularly employed as a pilot boat, are
    hereby constituted inspectors to execute this act, so far as the
    same may be applicable to the Chesapeake Bay, and the waters
    tributary thereto, within the jurisdiction of this State,
    together with such other inspectors as may be appointed by
    virtue of this act.

    (3.) The branch or license issued to a pilot according to the
    provisions of the 92d chapter of Code, shall be sufficient
    evidence that he is authorized and empowered to act as inspector
    as aforesaid.

    (4.) It shall be the duty of the inspector, or other person
    authorized to act under this law, to examine and search all
    vessels hereinbefore described, to see that no slave or person
    held to service or labor in this State, or person charged with
    the commission of any crime within the State, shall be concealed
    on board said vessel. Such inspection shall be made within
    twelve hours of the time of departure of such vessel from the
    waters of Virginia, and may be made in any bay, river, creek, or
    other water-course of the State, provided, however, that
    steamers plying as regular packets, between ports in Virginia
    and those north of, and outside of the capes of Virginia, shall
    be inspected at the port of departure nearest Old Point Comfort.

    (5.) A vessel so inspected and getting under way, with intent to
    leave the waters of the State, if she returns to an anchorage
    above Back River Point, or within Old Point Comfort, shall be
    again inspected and charged as if an original case. If such
    vessel be driven back by stress of weather to seek a harbor, she
    shall be exempt from payment of a second fee, unless she holds
    intercourse with the shore.

    (6.) If, after searching the vessel, the inspector see no just
    cause to detain her, he shall give to the captain a certificate
    to that effect. If, however, upon such inspection, or in any
    other manner, any slave or person held to service or labor, or
    any person charged with any crime, be found on board of any
    vessel whatever, for the purpose aforesaid, or said vessel be
    detected in the act of leaving this commonwealth with any such
    slave or person on board, or otherwise violating the provisions
    of this act, he shall attach said vessel, and arrest all persons
    on board, to be delivered up to the sergeant or sheriff of the
    nearest port in this commonwealth, to be dealt with according to
    law.

    (7.) If any inspector or other officer be opposed, or shall have
    reason to suspect that he will be opposed or obstructed in the
    discharge of any duty required of him under this act, he shall
    have power to summon and command the force of any county or
    corporation to aid him in the discharge of such duty, and every
    person who shall resist, obstruct, or refuse to aid any
    inspector or other officer in the discharge of such duty, shall
    be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and, upon conviction thereof,
    shall be fined and imprisoned as in other cases of misdemeanor.

    (8.) For every inspection of a vessel under this law, the
    inspector, or other officer shall be entitled to demand and
    receive the sum of five dollars; for the payment of which such
    vessel shall be liable, and the inspector or other officer may
    seize and hold her until the same is paid, together with all
    charges incurred in taking care of the vessel, as well as in
    enforcing the payment of the same. Provided, that steam packets
    trading regularly between the waters of Virginia and ports north
    of and beyond the capes of Virginia, shall pay not more than
    five dollars for each inspection under the provisions of this
    act; provided, however, that for every inspection of a vessel
    engaged in the coal trade, the inspector shall not receive a
    greater sum than two dollars.

    (9.) Any inspector or other person apprehending a slave in the
    act of escaping from the state, on board a vessel trading to or
    belonging to a non-slave-holding state, or who shall give
    information that will lead to the recovery of any slave, as
    aforesaid, shall be entitled to a reward of One Hundred Dollars,
    to be paid by the owner of such slave, or by the fiduciary
    having charge of the estate to which such slave belongs; and if
    the vessel be forfeited under the provisions of this act, he
    shall be entitled to one-half of the proceeds arising from the
    sale of the vessel; and if the same amounts to one hundred
    dollars, he shall not receive from the owner the above reward of
    one hundred dollars.

    (10.) An inspector permitting a slave to escape for the want of
    proper exertion, or by neglect in the discharge of his duty,
    shall be fined One Hundred Dollars; or if for like causes he
    permit a vessel, which the law requires him to inspect, to leave
    the state without inspection, he shall be fined not less than
    twenty, nor more than fifty dollars, to be recovered by warrant
    by any person who will proceed against him.

    (11.) No pilot acting under the authority of the laws of the
    state, shall pilot out of the jurisdiction of this state any
    such vessel as is described in this act, which has not obtained
    and exhibited to him the certificate of inspection hereby
    required; and if any pilot shall so offend, he shall forfeit and
    pay not less than twenty, or more than fifty dollars, to be
    recovered in the mode prescribed in the next preceding section
    of this act.

    (12.) The courts of the several counties or corporations
    situated on the Chesapeake Bay, or its tributaries, by an order
    entered on record, may appoint one or more inspectors, at such
    place or places within their respective districts as they may
    deem necessary, to prevent the escape or for the recapture of
    slaves attempting to escape beyond the limits of the state, and
    to search or otherwise examine all vessels trading to such
    counties or corporations. The expenses in such cases to be
    provided for by a levy on negroes now taxed by law; but no
    inspection by county or corporation officers thus appointed,
    shall supersede the inspection of such vessels by pilots and
    other inspectors, as specially provided for in this act.

    (13.) It shall be lawful for the county court of any county,
    upon the application of five or more slave-holders, residents of
    the counties where the application is made, by an order of
    record, to designate one or more police stations in their
    respective counties, and a captain and three or more other
    persons as a police patrol on each station, for the recapture of
    fugitive slaves; which patrol shall be in service at such times,
    and such stations as the court shall direct by their order
    aforesaid; and the said court shall allow a reasonable
    compensation, to be paid to the members of such patrol; and for
    that purpose, the said court may from time to time direct a levy
    on negroes now taxed by law, at such rate per capita as the
    court may think sufficient, to be collected and accounted for by
    the sheriff as other county levies, and to be called, "The
    fugitive slave tax." The owner of each fugitive slave in the act
    of escaping beyond the limits of the commonwealth, to a
    non-slave-holding state, and captured by the patrol aforesaid,
    shall pay for each slave over fifteen, and under forty-five
    years old, a reward of One Hundred dollars; for each slave over
    five, and under fifteen years old, the sum of sixty dollars; and
    for all others, the sum of forty dollars. Which reward shall be
    divided equally among the members of the patrol retaking the
    slave and actually on duty at the time; and to secure the
    payment of said reward, the said patrol may retain possession
    and use of the slave until the reward is paid or secured to
    them.

    (14.) The executive of this State may appoint one or more
    inspectors for the Rappahannock and Potomac rivers, if he shall
    deem it expedient, for the due execution of this act. The
    inspectors so appointed to perform the same duties, and to be
    invested with the same powers in their respective districts, and
    receive the same fees, as pilots acting as inspectors in other
    parts of the State. A vessel subject to inspection under this
    law, departing from any of the above-named counties or rivers on
    her voyage to sea, shall be exempted from the payment of a fee
    for a second inspection by another officer, if provided with a
    certificate from the proper inspecting officer of that district;
    but if, after proceeding on her voyage, she returns to the port
    or place of departure, or enters any other port, river, or
    roadstead in the State, the said vessel shall be again
    inspected, and pay a fee of five dollars, as if she had
    undergone no previous examination and received no previous
    certificate.

    If driven by stress of weather to seek a harbor, and she has no
    intercourse with the shore, then, and in that case, no second
    fee shall be paid by said vessel.

    (15.) For the better execution of the provisions of this act, in
    regard to the inspection, of vessels, the executive is hereby
    authorized and directed to appoint a chief inspector, to reside
    at Norfolk, whose duty it shall be, to direct and superintend
    the police, agents, or inspectors above referred to. He shall
    keep a record of all vessels engaged in the piloting business,
    together with a list of such persons as may be employed as
    pilots and inspectors under this law. The owner or owners of
    each boat shall make a monthly report to him, of all vessels
    inspected by persons attached to said pilot boats, the names of
    such vessels, the owner or owners thereof, and the places where
    owned or licensed, and where trading to or from, and the
    business in which they are engaged, together with a list of
    their crews. Any inspector failing to make his report to the
    chief inspector, shall pay a fine of twenty dollars for each
    such failure, which fine shall be recovered by warrant, before a
    justice of the county or corporation. The chief inspector may
    direct the time and station for the cruise of each pilot boat,
    and perform such other duty as the Governor may designate, not
    inconsistent with the other provisions of this act. He shall
    make a quarterly return to the executive of all the transactions
    of his department, reporting to him any failure or refusal on
    the part of inspectors to discharge the duty assigned to them,
    and the Governor, for sufficient cause, may suspend or remove
    from office any delinquent inspector. The chief inspector shall
    receive as his compensation, ten per cent, on all the fees and
    fines received by the inspectors acting under his authority, and
    may be removed at the pleasure of the executive.

    (16.) All fees and forfeitures imposed by this act, and not
    otherwise specially provided for, shall go one half to the
    informer, and the other be paid into the treasury of the State,
    to constitute a fund, to be called the "fugitive slave fund,"
    and to be used for the payment of rewards awarded by the
    Governor, for the apprehension of runaway slaves, and to pay
    other expenses incident to the execution of this law, together
    with such other purposes as may hereafter be determined on by
    the General Assembly.

    (17.) This act shall be in force from its passage.

ESCAPING IN A CHEST.



    $150 REWARD. Ran away from the subscriber, on Sunday night, 27th
    inst., my NEGRO GIRL, Lear Green, about 18 years of age, black
    complexion, round-featured, good-looking and ordinary size; she
    had on and with her when she left, a tan-colored silk bonnet, a
    dark plaid silk dress, a light mouslin delaine, also one watered
    silk cape and one tan colored cape. I have reason to be
    confident that she was persuaded off by a negro man named Wm.
    Adams, black, quick spoken, 5 feet 10 inches high, a large scar
    on one side of his face, running down in a ridge by the corner
    of his mouth, about 4 inches long, barber by trade, but works
    mostly about taverns, opening oysters, &c. He has been missing
    about a week; he had been heard to say he was going to marry the
    above girl and ship to New York, where it is said his mother
    resides. The above reward will be paid if said girl is taken out
    of the State of Maryland and delivered to me; or fifty dollars
    if taken in the State of Maryland.

    JAMES NOBLE,

    m26-3t.

    No. 153 Broadway, Baltimore.


Lear Green, so particularly advertised in the "Baltimore Sun" by "James
Noble," won for herself a strong claim to a high place among the heroic
women of the nineteenth century. In regard to description and age the
advertisement is tolerably accurate, although her master might have
added, that her countenance was one of peculiar modesty and grace.
Instead of being "black," she was of a "dark-brown color." Of her
bondage she made the following statement: She was owned by "James Noble,
a Butter Dealer" of Baltimore. He fell heir to Lear by the will of his
wife's mother, Mrs. Rachel Howard, by whom she had previously been
owned. Lear was but a mere child when she came into the hands of Noble's
family. She, therefore, remembered but little of her old mistress. Her
young mistress, however, had made a lasting impression upon her mind;
for she was very exacting and oppressive in regard to the tasks she was
daily in the habit of laying upon Lear's shoulders, with no disposition
whatever to allow her any liberties. At least Lear was never indulged in
this respect. In this situation a young man by the name of William Adams
proposed marriage to her. This offer she was inclined to accept, but
disliked the idea of being encumbered with the chains of slavery and the
duties of a family at the same time.

After a full consultation with her mother and also her intended upon the
matter, she decided that she must be free in order to fill the station
of a wife and mother. For a time dangers and difficulties in the way of
escape seemed utterly to set at defiance all hope of success. Whilst
every pulse was beating strong for liberty, only one chance seemed to be
left, the trial of which required as much courage as it would to endure
the cutting off the right arm or plucking out the right eye. An old
chest of substantial make, such as sailors commonly use, was procured. A
quilt, a pillow, and a few articles of raiment, with a small quantity of
food and a bottle of water were put in it, and Lear placed therein;
strong ropes were fastened around the chest and she was safely stowed
amongst the ordinary freight on one of the Erricson line of steamers.
Her intended's mother, who was a free woman, agreed to come as a
passenger on the same boat. How could she refuse? The prescribed rules
of the Company assigned colored passengers to the deck. In this instance
it was exactly where this guardian and mother desired to be--as near the
chest as possible. Once or twice, during the silent watches of the
night, she was drawn irresistibly to the chest, and could not refrain
from venturing to untie the rope and raise the lid a little, to see if
the poor child still lived, and at the same time to give her a breath of
fresh air. Without uttering a whisper, that frightful moment, this
office was successfully performed. That the silent prayers of this
oppressed young woman, together with her faithful protector's, were
momentarily ascending to the ear of the good God above, there can be no
question. Nor is it to be doubted for a moment but that some ministering
angel aided the mother to unfasten the rope, and at the same time nerved
the heart of poor Lear to endure the trying ordeal of her perilous
situation. She declared that she had no fear.

After she had passed eighteen hours in the chest, the steamer arrived at
the wharf in Philadelphia, and in due time the living freight was
brought off the boat, and at first was delivered at a house in Barley
street, occupied by particular friends of the mother. Subsequently chest
and freight were removed to the residence of the writer, in whose family
she remained several days under the protection and care of the Vigilance
Committee.

[Illustration: ]

Such hungering and thirsting for liberty, as was evinced by Lear Green,
made the efforts of the most ardent friends, who were in the habit of
aiding fugitives, seem feeble in the extreme. Of all the heroes in
Canada, or out of it, who have purchased their liberty by downright
bravery, through perils the most hazardous, none deserve more praise
than Lear Green.

She remained for a time in this family, and was then forwarded to
Elmira. In this place she was married to William Adams, who has been
previously alluded to. They never went to Canada, but took up their
permanent abode in Elmira. The brief space of about three years only was
allotted her in which to enjoy freedom, as death came and terminated her
career. About the time of this sad occurrence, her mother-in-law died in
this city. The impressions made by both mother and daughter can never be
effaced. The chest in which Lear escaped has been preserved by the
writer as a rare trophy, and her photograph taken, while in the chest,
is an excellent likeness of her and, at the same time, a fitting
memorial.

ISAAC WILLIAMS, HENRY BANKS, AND KIT NICKLESS.


MONTHS IN A CAVE,--SHOT BY SLAVE-HUNTERS.


Rarely were three travelers from the house of bondage received at the
Philadelphia station whose narratives were more interesting than those
of the above-named individuals. Before escaping they had encountered
difficulties of the most trying nature. No better material for dramatic
effect could be found than might have been gathered from the incidents
of their lives and travels. But all that we can venture to introduce
here is the brief account recorded at the time of their sojourn at the
Philadelphia station when on their way to Canada in 1854. The three
journeyed together. They had been slaves together in the same
neighborhood. Two of them had shared the same den and cave in the woods,
and had been shot, captured, and confined in the same prison; had broken
out of prison and again escaped; consequently their hearts were
thoroughly cemented in the hope of reaching freedom together.

Isaac was a stout-made young man, about twenty-six years of age,
possessing a good degree of physical and mental ability. Indeed his
intelligence forbade his submission to the requirements of Slavery,
rendered him unhappy and led him to seek his freedom. He owed services
to D. Fitchhugh up to within a short time before he escaped. Against
Fitchhugh he made grave charges, said that he was a "hard, bad man." It
is but fair to add that Isaac was similarly regarded by his master, so
both were dissatisfied with each other. But the master had the advantage
of Isaac, he could sell him. Isaac, however, could turn the table on his
master, by running off. But the master moved quickly and sold Isaac to
Dr. James, a negro trader. The trader designed making a good speculation
out of his investment: Isaac determined that he should be disappointed;
indeed that he should lose every dollar that he paid for him. So while
the doctor was planning where and how he could get the best price for
him, Isaac was planning how and where he might safely get beyond his
reach. The time for planning and acting with Isaac was, however,
exceedingly short. He was daily expecting to be called upon to take his
departure for the South. In this situation he made known his condition
to a friend of his who was in a precisely similar situation; had lately
been sold just as Isaac had to the same trader James. So no argument was
needed to convince his friend and fellow-servant that if they meant to
be free they would have to set off immediately.

That night Henry Banks and Isaac Williams started for the woods
together, preferring to live among reptiles and wild animals, rather
than be any longer at the disposal of Dr. James. For two weeks they
successfully escaped their pursuers. The woods, however, were being
hunted in every direction, and one day the pursuers came upon them, shot
them both, and carried them to King George's Co. jail. The jail being an
old building had weak places in it; but the prisoners concluded to make
no attempt to break out while suffering badly from their wounds. So they
remained one month in confinement. All the while their brave spirits
under suffering grew more and more daring. Again they decided to strike
for freedom, but where to go, save to the woods, they had not the
slightest idea. Of course they had heard, as most slaves had, of cave
life, and pretty well understood all the measures which had to be
resorted to for security when entering upon so hazardous an undertaking.
They concluded, however, that they could not make their condition any
worse, let circumstances be what they might in this respect. Having
discovered how they could break jail, they were not long in
accomplishing their purpose, and were out and off to the woods again.
This time they went far into the forest, and there they dug a cave, and
with great pains had every thing so completely arranged as to conceal
the spot entirely. In this den they stayed three months. Now and then
they would manage to secure a pig. A friend also would occasionally
serve them with a meal. Their sufferings at best were fearful; but great
as they were, the thought of returning to Slavery never occurred to
them, and the longer they stayed in the woods, the greater was their
determination to be free. In the belief that their owner had about given
them up they resolved to take the North Star for a pilot, and try in
this way to reach free land.

Kit, an old friend in time of need, having proved true to them in their
cave, was consulted. He fully appreciated their heroism, and determined
that he would join them in the undertaking, as he was badly treated by
his master, who was called General Washington, a common farmer, hard
drinker, and brutal fighter, which Kit's poor back fully evinced by the
marks it bore. Of course Isaac and Henry were only too willing to have
him accompany them.

In leaving their respective homes they broke kindred ties of the
tenderest nature. Isaac had a wife, Eliza, and three children, Isaac,
Estella, and Ellen, all owned by Fitchhugh. Henry was only nineteen,
single, but left parents, brothers, and sisters, all owned by different
slave-holders. Kit had a wife, Matilda, and three children, Sarah Ann,
Jane Frances, and Ellen, slaves.

SEPTEMBER 28, 1856.


ARRIVAL OF FIVE FROM THE EASTERN SHORE OF MARYLAND.


CYRUS MITCHELL, _alias_ JOHN STEEL; JOSHUA HANDY, _alias_ HAMBLETON
HAMBY; CHARLES DULTON, _alias_ WILLIAM ROBINSON; EPHRAIM HUDSON, _alias_
JOHN SPRY; FRANCIS MOLOCK, _alias_ THOMAS JACKSON; all in "good order"
and full of hope.

The following letter from the fearless friend of the slave, Thomas
Garrett, is a specimen of his manner of dispatching Underground Rail
Road business. He used Uncle Sam's mail, and his own name, with as much
freedom as though he had been President of the Pennsylvania Central Rail
Road, instead of only a conductor and stock-holder on the Underground
Rail Road.


    9 mo. 26th, 1856.

    RESPECTED FRIEND:--WILLIAM STILL, I send on to thy care this
    evening by Rail Road, 5 able-bodied men, on their way North;
    receive them as the Good Samaritan of old and oblige thy friend,
    THOMAS GARRETT.


The "able-bodied men" duly arrived, and were thus recorded on the
Underground Rail Road books as trophies of the success of the friends of
humanity.



Cyrus is twenty-six years of age, stout, and unmistakably dark, and was
owned by James K. Lewis, a store-keeper, and a "hard master." He kept
slaves for the express purpose of hiring them out, and it seemed to
afford him as much pleasure to receive the hard-earned dollars of his
bondmen as if he had labored for them with his own hands. "It mattered
not, how mean a man might be," if he would pay the largest price, he was
the man whom the store-keeper preferred to hire to. This always caused
Cyrus to dislike him. Latterly he had been talking of moving into the
State of Virginia. Cyrus disliked this talk exceedingly, but he "said
nothing to the white people" touching the matter. However, he was not
long in deciding that such a move would be of no advantage to him;
indeed, he had an idea if all was true that he had heard about that
place, he would be still more miserable there, than he had ever been
under his present owner. At once, he decided that he would move towards
Canada, and that he would be fixed in his new home before his master got
off to Virginia, unless he moved sooner than Cyrus expected him to do.
Those nearest of kin, to whom he felt most tenderly allied, and from
whom he felt that it would be hard to part, were his father and mother.
He, however, decided that he should have to leave them. Freedom, he
felt, was even worth the giving up of parents.

Believing that company was desirable, he took occasion to submit his
plan to certain friends, who were at once pleased with the idea of a
trip on the Underground Rail Road, to Canada, etc; and all agreed to
join him. At first, they traveled on foot; of their subsequent travel,
mention has already been made in friend Garrett's epistle.



Joshua is about twenty-seven years of age, quite stout, brown color, and
would pass for an intelligent farm hand. He was satisfied never to wear
the yoke again that some one else might reap the benefit of his toil.
His master, Isaac Harris, he denounced as a "drunkard." His chief excuse
for escaping, was because Harris had "sold" his "only brother." He was
obliged to leave his father and mother in the hands of his master.



Charles is twenty-two years of age, also stout, and well-made, and
apparently possessed all the qualifications for doing a good day's work
on a farm. He was held to service by Mrs. Mary Hurley. Charles gave no
glowing account of happiness and comfort under the rule of the female
sex, indeed, he was positive in saying that he had "been used rough."
During the present year, he was sold for $1200.



Ephraim is twenty-two years of age, stout and athletic, one who appears
in every way fitted for manual labor or anything else that he might be
privileged to learn. John Campbell Henry, was the name of the man whom
he had been taught to address as master, and for whose benefit he had
been compelled to labor up to the day he "took out." In considering what
he had been in Maryland and how he had been treated all his life, he
alleged that John Campbell Henry was a "bad man." Not only had Ephraim
been treated badly by his master but he had been hired out to a man no
better than his master, if as good. Ephraim left his mother and six
brothers and sisters.



Francis is twenty-one, an able-bodied "article," of dark color, and was
owned by James A. Waddell. All that he could say of his owner, was, that
he was a "hard master," from whom he was very glad to escape.

While none in this catalogue belonged to the class whose daring
adventures rendered their narratives marvellous, nevertheless they
represented a very large number of those who were continually on the
alert to get rid of their captivity. And in all their efforts in this
direction they manifested a marked willingness to encounter perils
either by land or water, by day or by night, to obtain their God-given
rights. Doubtless, even among these names, will be found those who have
been supposed to be lost, and mysteries will be disclosed which have
puzzled scores of relatives longing and looking many years in vain to
ascertain the whereabouts of this or that companion, brother, sister, or
friend. So, if impelled by no other consideration than the hope of
consoling this class of anxious inquirers, this is a sufficient
justification for not omitting them entirely, notwithstanding the risk
of seeming to render these pages monotonous.



Arrival No. 1. First on this record was a young mulatto woman,
twenty-nine years of age--orange color, who could read and write very
well, and was unusually intelligent and withal quite handsome. She was
known by the name of Frances Hilliard, and escaped from Richmond, Va.,
where she was owned by Beverly Blair. The owner hired her out to a man
by the name of Green, from whom he received seventy dollars per annum.
Green allowed her to hire herself for the same amount, with the
understanding that Frances should find all her own clothes, board
herself and find her own house to live in. Her husband, who was also a
slave, had fled nearly one year previous, leaving her widowed, of
course. Notwithstanding the above mentioned conditions, under which she
had the privilege of living, Frances said that she "had been used well."
She had been sold four times in her life. In the first instance the
failure of her master was given as the reason of her sale. Subsequently
she was purchased and sold by different traders, who designed to
speculate upon her as a "fancy article." They would dress her very
elegantly, in order to show her off to the best advantage possible, but
it appears that she had too much regard for her husband and her honor,
to consent to fill the positions which had been basely assigned her by
her owners.

Frances assisted her husband to escape from his owner--Taits--and was
never contented until she succeeded in following him to Canada. In
escaping, she left her mother, Sarah Corbin, and her sister, Maria. On
reaching the Vigilance Committee she learned all about her husband. She
was conveyed from Richmond secreted on a steamer under the care of one
of the colored hands on the boat. From here she was forwarded to Canada
at the expense of the Committee. Arriving in Toronto, and not finding
her hopes fully realized, with regard to meeting her husband, she wrote
back the following letter:


    TORONTO, CANADA, U.C., October 15th, 1855.

    MY DEAR MR. STILL:--Sir--I take the opportunity of writing you a
    few lines to inform you of my health. I am very well at present,
    and hope that when these few lines reach you they may find you
    enjoying the same blessing. Give my love to Mrs. Still and all
    the children, and also to Mr. Swan, and tell him that he must
    give you the money that he has, and you will please send it to
    me, as I have received a letter from my husband saying that I
    must come on to him as soon as I get the money from him. I
    cannot go to him until I get the money that Mr. Swan has in
    hand. Please tell Mr. Caustle that the clothes he spoke of my
    mother did not know anything about them. I left them with Hinson
    Brown and he promised to give them to Mr. Smith. Tell him to ask
    Mr. Smith to get them from Mr. Brown for me, and when I get
    settled I will send him word and he can send them to me. The
    letters that were sent to me I received them all. I wish you
    would send me word if Mr. Smith is on the boat yet--if he is
    please write me word in your next letter. Please send me the
    money as soon as you possibly can, for I am very anxious to see
    my husband. I send to you for I think you will do what you can
    for me. No more at present, but remain Yours truly,

    FRANCES HILLIARD.

    Send me word if Mr. Caustle had given Mr. Smith the money that
    he promised to give him.


For one who had to steal the art of reading and writing, her letter
bears studying.



Arrival No. 2. Louisa Harding, alias Rebecca Hall. Louisa was a mulatto
girl, seventeen years of age. She reported herself from Baltimore, where
she had been owned by lawyer Magill. It might be said that she also
possessed great personal attractions as an "article" of much value in
the eye of a trader. All the near kin whom she named as having left
behind, consisted of a mother and a brother.



Arrival No. 3. John Mackintosh. John's history is short. He represented
himself as having arrived from Darien, Georgia, where he had seen "hard
times." Age, forty-four. This is all that was recorded of John, except
the expenses met by the Committee.



Arrival No. 4. Maria Jane Houston. The little State of Delaware lost in
the person of Maria, one of her nicest-looking bond-maids. She had just
arrived at the age of twenty-one, and felt that she had already been
sufficiently wronged. She was a tall, dark, young woman, from the
neighborhood of Cantwell's Bridge. Although she had no horrible tales of
suffering to relate, the Committee regarded her as well worthy of aid.




Arrival No. 5. Miles Hooper. This subject came from North Carolina; he
was owned by George Montigue, who lived at Federal Mills, was a decided
opponent to the no-pay system, to flogging, and selling likewise. In
fact nothing that was auxiliary to Slavery was relished by him.
Consequently he concluded to leave the place altogether. At the time
that Miles took this stand he was twenty-three years of age, a
dark-complexioned man, rather under the medium height, physically, but a
full-grown man mentally. "My owner was a hard man," said Miles, in
speaking of his characteristics. His parents, brothers, and sisters were
living, at least he had reason to believe so, although they were widely
scattered.



Arrival No. 6. Samuel Miles, alias Robert King. Samuel was a
representative of Revel's Neck, Somerset Co., Md. His master he regarded
as a "very fractious man, hard to please." The cause of the trouble or
unpleasantness, which resulted in Samuel's Underground adventure, was
traceable to his master's refusal to allow him to visit his wife. Not
only was Samuel denied this privilege, but he was equally denied all
privileges. His master probably thought that Sam had no mind, nor any
need of a wife. Whether this was really so or not, Sam was shrewd enough
to "leave his old master with the bag to hold," which was sensible.
Thirty-one years of Samuel's life were passed in Slavery, ere he
escaped. The remainder of his days he felt bound to have the benefit of
himself. In leaving home he had to part with his wife and one child,
Sarah and little Henry, who were fortunately free.

On arriving in Canada Samuel wrote back for his wife, &c., as follows:


    ST. CATHARINES, C.W., Aug. 20th, 1855.

    To MR. WM. STILL, DEAR FRIEND:--It gives me pleasure to inform
    you that I have had the good fortune to reach this northern
    Canaan. I got here yesterday and am in good health and happy in
    the enjoyment of Freedom, but am very anxious to have my wife
    and child here with me.

    I wish you to write to her immediately on receiving this and let
    her know where I am you will recollect her name Sarah Miles at
    Baltimore on the corner of Hamburg and Eutaw streets. Please
    encourage her in making a start and give her the necessary
    directions how to come. She will please to make the time as
    short as possible in getting through to Canada. Say to my wife
    that I wish her to write immediately to the friends that I told
    her to address as soon as she hears from me. Inform her that I
    now stop in St. Catharines near the Niagara Falls that I am not
    yet in business but expect to get into business very soon--That
    I am in the enjoyment of good health and hoping that this
    communication may find my affectionate wife the same. That I
    have been highly favored with friends throughout my journey I
    wish my wife to write to me as soon as she can and let me know
    how soon I may expect to see her on this side of the Niagara
    River. My wife had better call on Dr. Perkins and perhaps he
    will let her have the money he had in charge for me but that I
    failed of receiving when I left Baltimore. Please direct the
    letter for my wife to Mr. George Lister, in Hill street between
    Howard and Sharp. My compliments to all enquiring friends.

    Very respectfully yours,

    SAMUEL MILES.

    P.S. Please send the thread along as a token and my wife will
    understand that all is right. S.M.




Arrival No. 7. James Henson, alias David Caldwell. James fled from Cecil
Co., Md. He claimed that he was entitled to his freedom according to law
at the age of twenty-eight, but had been unjustly deprived of it. Having
waited in vain for his free papers for four years, he suspected that he
was to be dealt with in a manner similar to many others, who had been
willed free or who had bought their time, and had been shamefully
cheated out of their freedom. So in his judgment he felt that his only
hope lay in making his escape on the Underground Rail Road. He had no
faith whatever in the man who held him in bondage, Jacob Johnson, but no
other charges of ill treatment, &c., have been found against said
Johnson on the books, save those alluded to above.

James was thirty-two years of age, stout and well proportioned, with
more than average intelligence and resolution. He left a wife and child,
both free.



Arrival No. 8. Laura Lewis. Laura arrived from Louisville, Kentucky. She
had been owned by a widow woman named Lewis, but as lately as the
previous March her mistress died, leaving her slaves and other property
to be divided among her heirs. As this would necessitate a sale of the
slaves, Laura determined not to be on hand when the selling day came, so
she took time by the forelock and left. Her appearance indicated that
she had been among the more favored class of slaves. She was about
twenty-five years of age, quite stout, of mixed blood, and intelligent,
having traveled considerably with her mistress. She had been North in
this capacity. She left her mother, one brother, and one sister in
Louisville.



Arrival No. 9. Elizabeth Banks, from near Easton, Maryland. Her lot had
been that of an ordinary slave. Of her slave-life nothing of interest
was recorded. She had escaped from her owner two and a half years prior
to coming into the hands of the Committee, and had been living in
Pennsylvania pretty securely as she had supposed, but she had been
awakened to a sense of her danger by well grounded reports that she was
pursued by her claimant, and would be likely to be captured if she
tarried short of Canada. With such facts staring her in the face she was
sent to the Committee for counsel and protection, and by them she was
forwarded on in the usual way. She was about twenty-five years of age,
of a dark, and spare structure.



Arrival No. 10. Simon Hill. This fugitive had escaped from Virginia. The
usual examination was made, and needed help given him by the Committee
who felt satisfied that he was a poor brother who had been shamefully
wronged, and that he richly deserved sympathy. He was aided and directed
Canada-ward. He was a very humble-looking specimen of the peculiar
institution, about twenty-five years of age, medium size, and of a dark
hue.



Arrival No. 11. Anthony and Albert Brown (brothers), Jones Anderson and
Isaiah.

This party escaped from Tanner's Creek, Norfolk, Virginia, where they
had been owned by John and Henry Holland, oystermen. As slaves they
alleged that they had been subjected to very brutal treatment from their
profane and ill-natured owners. Not relishing this treatment, Albert and
Anthony came to the conclusion that they understood boating well enough
to escape by water. They accordingly selected one of their master's
small oyster-boats, which was pretty-well rigged with sails, and off
they started for a Northern Shore. They proceeded on a part of their
voyage merely by guess work, but landed safely, however, about
twenty-five miles north of Baltimore, though, by no means, on free soil.
They had no knowledge of the danger that they were then in, but they
were persevering, and still determined to make their way North, and
thus, at last, success attended their efforts. Their struggles and
exertions having been attended with more of the romantic and tragical
elements than had characterized the undertakings of any of the other
late passengers, the Committee felt inclined to make a fuller notice of
them on the book, yet failed to do them justice in this respect.

The elder brother was twenty-nine, the younger twenty-seven. Both were
mentally above the average run of slaves. They left wives in Norfolk,
named Alexenia and Ellen. While Anthony and Albert, in seeking their
freedom, were forced to sever their connections with their companions,
they did not forget them in Canada.

How great was their delight in freedom, and tender their regard for
their wives, and the deep interest they felt for their brethren and
friends generally, may be seen from a perusal of the following letters
from them:


    HAMELTON, March 7th 1856.

    city for Boston about 2 weeks ago, we have not herd from him
    yet.

    A. BROWN.




Arrival No. 12. George Williams and Charles Holladay. These two
travelers were about the same age. They were not, however, from the same
neighborhood--they happened to meet each other as they were traveling
the road. George fled from St. Louis, Charles from Baltimore. George
"owed service" to Isaac Hill, a planter; he found no special fault with
his master's treatment of him; but with Mrs. Hill, touching this point,
he was thoroughly dissatisfied. She had treated him "cruelly," and it
was for this reason that he was moved to seek his freedom.

Charles, being a Baltimorean, had not far to travel, but had pretty
sharp hunters to elude.

His claimant, F. Smith, however, had only a term of years claim upon
him, which was within about two years of being out. This contract for
the term of years, Charles felt was made without consulting him,
therefore he resolved to break it without consulting his master. He also
declined to have anything to do with the Baltimore and Wilmington R.R.
Co., considering it a prescriptive institution, not worthy of his
confidence. He started on a fast walk, keeping his eyes wide open,
looking out for slave-hunters on his right and left. In this way, like
many others, he reached the Committee safely and was freely aided,
thenceforth traveling in a first class Underground Rail Road car, till
he reached his journey's end.



Arrival No. 13. William Govan. Availing himself of a passage on the
schooner of Captain B., William left Petersburg, where he had been owned
by "Mark Davis, Esq., a retired gentleman," rather, a retired negro
trader.

William was about thirty-three years of age, and was of a bright orange
color. Nothing but an ardent love of liberty prompted him to escape. He
was quite smart, and a clever-looking man, worth at least $1,000.

DEEP FURROWS ON THE BACK.


THOMAS MADDEN.


Of all the passengers who had hitherto arrived with bruised and mangled
bodies received at the hands of slave-holders, none brought a back so
shamefully lacerated by the lash as Thomas Madden. Not a single spot had
been exempted from the excoriating cow-hide. A most bloody picture did
the broad back and shoulders of Thomas present to the eye as he bared
his wounds for inspection. While it was sad to think, that millions of
men, women, and children throughout the South were liable to just such
brutal outrages as Thomas had received, it was a satisfaction to think,
that this outrage had made a freeman of him.

He was only twenty-two years of age, but that punishment convinced him
that he was fully old enough to leave such a master as E. Ray, who had
almost murdered him. But for this treatment, Thomas might have remained
in some degree contented in Slavery. He was expected to look after the
fires in the house on Sunday mornings. In a single instance desiring to
be absent, perhaps for his own pleasure, two boys offered to be his
substitute. The services of the boys were accepted, and this gave
offence to the master. This Thomas declared was the head and front of
his offending. His simple narration of the circumstances of his slave
life was listened to by the Committee with deep interest and a painful
sense of the situation of slaves under the despotism of such men as Ray.

After being cared for by the Committee he was sent on to Canada. When
there he wrote back to let the Committee know how he was faring, the
narrow escape he had on the way, and likewise to convey the fact, that
one named "Rachel," left behind, shared a large place in his affections.
The subjoined letter is the only correspondence of his preserved:


    STANFORD, June 1st, 1855, Niagara districk.

    DEAR SIR:--I set down to inform you that I take the liberty to
    rite for a frend to inform you that he is injoying good health
    and hopes that this will finde you the same he got to this
    cuntry very well except that in Albany he was vary neig taking
    back to his oald home but escaped and when he came to the
    suspention bridg he was so glad that he run for freadums shore
    and when he arived it was the last of October and must look for
    sum wourk for the winter he choped wood until Feruary times are
    good but money is scarce he thinks a great deal of the girl he
    left behind him he thinks that there is non like her here non so
    hansom as his Rachel right and let him hear from you as soon as
    convaniant no more at presant but remain yours,

    ALBERT METTER.




"PETE MATTHEWS," ALIAS SAMUEL SPARROWS.


"I MIGHT AS WELL BE IN THE PENITENTIARY, &C."


Up to the age of thirty-five "Pete" had worn the yoke steadily, if not
patiently under William S. Matthews, of Oak Hall, near Temperanceville,
in the State of Virginia. Pete said that his "master was not a hard
man," but the man to whom he "was hired, George Matthews, was a very
cruel man." "I might as well be in the penitentiary as in his hands,"
was his declaration.

One day, a short while before Pete "took out," an ox broke into the
truck patch, and helped himself to choice delicacies, to the full extent
of his capacious stomach, making sad havoc with the vegetables
generally. Peter's attention being directed to the ox, he turned him
out, and gave him what he considered proper chastisement, according to
the mischief he had done. At this liberty taken by Pete, the master
became furious. "He got his gun and threatened to shoot him," "Open your
mouth if you dare, and I will pat the whole load into you," said the
enraged master. "He took out a large dirk-knife, and attempted to stab
me, but I kept out of his way," said Pete. Nevertheless the violence of
the master did not abate until he had beaten Pete over the head and body
till he was weary, inflicting severe injuries. A great change was at
once wrought in Pete's mind. He was now ready to adopt any plan that
might hold out the least encouragement to escape. Having capital to the
amount of four dollars only, he felt that he could not do much towards
employing a conductor, but he had a good pair of legs, and a heart stout
enough to whip two or three slave-catchers, with the help of a pistol.
Happening to know a man who had a pistol for sale, he went to him and
told him that he wished to purchase it. For one dollar the pistol became
Pete's property. He had but three dollars left, but he was determined to
make that amount answer his purposes under the circumstances. The last
cruel beating maddened him almost to desperation, especially when he
remembered how he had been compelled to work hard night and day, under
Matthews. Then, too, Peter had a wife, whom his master prevented him
from visiting; this was not among the least offences with which Pete
charged his master. Fully bent on leaving, the following Sunday was
fixed by him on which to commence his journey.

The time arrived and Pete bade farewell to Slavery, resolved to follow
the North Star, with his pistol in hand ready for action. After
traveling about two hundred miles from home he unexpectedly had an
opportunity of using his pistol. To his astonishment he suddenly came
face to face with a former master, whom he had not seen for a long time.
Pete desired no friendly intercourse with him whatever; but he perceived
that his old master recognized him and was bent upon stopping him. Pete
held on to his pistol, but moved as fast as his wearied limbs would
allow him, in an opposite direction. As he was running, Pete cautiously,
cast his eye over his shoulder, to see what had become of his old
master, when to his amazement, he found that a regular chase was being
made after him. Need of redoubling his pace was quite obvious. In this
hour of peril, Pete's legs saved him.

After this signal leg-victory, Pete had more confidence in his
"understandings," than he had in his old pistol, although he held on to
it until he reached Philadelphia, where he left it in the possession of
the Secretary of the Committee. Considering it worth saving simply as a
relic of the Underground Rail Road, it was carefully laid aside. Pete
was now christened Samuel Sparrows. Mr. Sparrows had the rust of Slavery
washed off as clean as possible and the Committee furnishing him with
clean clothes, a ticket, and letters of introduction, started him on
Canada-ward, looking quite respectable. And doubtless he felt even more
so than he looked; free air had a powerful effect on such passengers as
Samuel Sparrows.

The unpleasantness which grew out of the mischief done by the ox on
George Matthews' farm took place the first of October, 1855. Pete may be
described as a man of unmixed blood, well-made, and intelligent.

The coming of these passengers was heralded by Thomas Garrett as
follows:



THOMAS GARRETT'S LETTER.



    WILMINGTON, 12 mo. 29th, 1854.

    ESTEEMED FRIEND, J. MILLER MCKIM:--We made arrangements last
    night, and sent away Harriet Tubman, with six men and one woman
    to Allen Agnew's, to be forwarded across the country to the
    city. Harriet, and one of the men had worn their shoes off their
    feet, and I gave them two dollars to help fit them out, and
    directed a carriage to be hired at my expense, to take them out,
    but do not yet know the expense. I now have two more from the
    lowest county in Maryland, on the Peninsula, upwards of one
    hundred miles. I will try to get one of our trusty colored men
    to take them to-morrow morning to the Anti-slavery office. You
    can then pass them on.

    THOMAS GARRETT.


HARRIET TUBMAN had been their "Moses," but not in the sense that Andrew
Johnson was the "Moses of the colored people." She had faithfully gone
down into Egypt, and had delivered these six bondmen by her own heroism.
Harriet was a woman of no pretensions, indeed, a more ordinary specimen
of humanity could hardly be found among the most unfortunate-looking
farm hands of the South. Yet, in point of courage, shrewdness and
disinterested exertions to rescue her fellow-men, by making personal
visits to Maryland among the slaves, she was without her equal.

Her success was wonderful. Time and again she made successful visits to
Maryland on the Underground Rail Road, and would be absent for weeks, at
a time, running daily risks while making preparations for herself and
passengers. Great fears were entertained for her safety, but she seemed
wholly devoid of personal fear. The idea of being captured by
slave-hunters or slave-holders, seemed never to enter her mind. She was
apparently proof against all adversaries. While she thus manifested such
utter personal indifference, she was much more watchful with regard to
those she was piloting. Half of her time, she had the appearance of one
asleep, and would actually sit down by the road-side and go fast asleep
when on her errands of mercy through the South, yet, she would not
suffer one of her party to whimper once, about "giving out and going
back," however wearied they might be from hard travel day and night. She
had a very short and pointed rule or law of her own, which implied death
to any who talked of giving out and going back. Thus, in an emergency
she would give all to understand that "times were very critical and
therefore no foolishness would be indulged in on the road." That several
who were rather weak-kneed and faint-hearted were greatly invigorated by
Harriet's blunt and positive manner and threat of extreme measures,
there could be no doubt.

After having once enlisted, "they had to go through or die." Of course
Harriet was supreme, and her followers generally had full faith in her,
and would back up any word she might utter. So when she said to them
that "a live runaway could do great harm by going back, but that a dead
one could tell no secrets," she was sure to have obedience. Therefore,
none had to die as traitors on the "middle passage." It is obvious
enough, however, that her success in going into Maryland as she did, was
attributable to her adventurous spirit and utter disregard of
consequences. Her like it is probable was never known before or since.
On examining the six passengers who came by this arrival they were thus
recorded:



December 29th, 1854--John is twenty years of age, chestnut color, of
spare build and smart. He fled from a farmer, by the name of John
Campbell Henry, who resided at Cambridge, Dorchester Co., Maryland. On
being interrogated relative to the character of his master, John gave no
very amiable account of him. He testified that he was a "hard man" and
that he "owned about one hundred and forty slaves and sometimes he would
sell," etc. John was one of the slaves who were "hired out." He "desired
to have the privilege of hunting his own master." His desire was not
granted. Instead of meekly submitting, John felt wronged, and made this
his reason for running away. This looked pretty spirited on the part of
one so young as John. The Committee's respect for him was not a little
increased, when they heard him express himself.



Benjamin was twenty-eight years of age, chestnut color, medium size, and
shrewd. He was the so-called property of Eliza Ann Brodins, who lived
near Buckstown, in Maryland. Ben did not hesitate to say, in unqualified
terms, that his mistress was "very devilish." He considered his charges,
proved by the fact that three slaves (himself one of them) were required
to work hard and fare meagerly, to support his mistress' family in
idleness and luxury. The Committee paid due attention to his ex parte
statement, and was obliged to conclude that his argument, clothed in
common and homely language, was forcible, if not eloquent, and that he
was well worthy of aid. Benjamin left his parents besides one sister,
Mary Ann Williamson, who wanted to come away on the Underground Rail
Road.



Henry left his wife, Harriet Ann, to be known in future by the name of
"Sophia Brown." He was a fellow-servant of Ben's, and one of the
supports of Eliza A. Brodins.

Henry was only twenty-two, but had quite an insight into matters and
things going on among slaves and slave-holders generally, in country
life. He was the father of two small children, whom he had to leave
behind.



Peter was owned by George Wenthrop, a farmer, living near Cambridge, Md.
In answer to the question, how he had been used, he said "hard." Not a
pleasant thought did he entertain respecting his master, save that he
was no longer to demand the sweat of Peter's brow. Peter left parents,
who were free; he was born before they were emancipated, consequently,
he was retained in bondage.



Jane, aged twenty-two, instead of regretting that she had unadvisedly
left a kind mistress and indulgent master, who had afforded her
necessary comforts, affirmed that her master, "Rash Jones, was the worst
man in the country." The Committee were at first disposed to doubt her
sweeping statement, but when they heard particularly how she had been
treated, they thought Catharine had good ground for all that she said.
Personal abuse and hard usage, were the common lot of poor slave girls.



Robert was thirty-five years of age, of a chestnut color, and well made.
His report was similar to that of many others. He had been provided with
plenty of hard drudgery--hewing of wood and drawing of water, and had
hardly been treated as well as a gentleman would treat a dumb brute. His
feelings, therefore, on leaving his old master and home, were those of
an individual who had been unjustly in prison for a dozen years and had
at last regained his liberty.

The civilization, religion, and customs under which Robert and his
companions had been raised, were, he thought, "very wicked." Although
these travelers were all of the field-hand order, they were,
nevertheless, very promising, and they anticipated better days in
Canada. Good advice was proffered them on the subject of temperance,
industry, education, etc. Clothing, food and money were also given them
to meet their wants, and they were sent on their way rejoicing.



ESCAPED FROM "A WORTHLESS SOT."


JOHN ATKINSON.


John was a prisoner of hope under James Ray, of Portsmouth, Va., whom he
declared to be "a worthless sot." This character was fully set forth,
but the description is too disgusting for record. John was a dark
mulatto, thirty-one years of age, well-formed and intelligent. For some
years before escaping he had been in the habit of hiring his time for
$120 per annum. Daily toiling to support his drunken and brutal master,
was a hardship that John felt keenly, but was compelled to submit to up
to the day of his escape.

A part of John's life he had suffered many abuses from his oppressor,
and only a short while before freeing himself, the auction-block was
held up before his troubled mind. This caused him to take the first
daring step towards Canada,--to leave his wife, Mary, without bidding
her good-bye, or saying a word to her as to his intention of fleeing.

John came as a private passenger on one of the Richmond steamers, and
was indebted to the steward of the boat for his accommodations. Having
been received by the Committee, he was cared for and sent on his journey
Canada-ward. There he was happy, found employment and wanted for nothing
but his wife and clothing left in Virginia. On these two points he wrote
several times with considerable feeling.

Some slaves who hired their time in addition to the payment of their
monthly hire, purchased nice clothes for themselves, which they usually
valued highly, so much so, that after escaping they would not be
contented until they had tried every possible scheme to secure them.
They would write back continually, either to their friends in the North
or South, hoping thus to procure them.

Not unfrequently the persons who rendered them assistance in the South,
would be entrusted with all their effects, with the understanding, that
such valuables would be forwarded to a friend or to the Committee at the
earliest opportunity. The Committee strongly protested against fugitives
writing back to the South (through the mails) on account of the
liability of getting parties into danger, as all such letters were
liable to be intercepted in order to the discovery of the names of such
as aided the Underground Rail Road. To render needless this writing to
the South the Committee often submitted to be taxed with demands to
rescue clothing as well as wives, etc., belonging to such as had been
already aided.

The following letters are fair samples of a large number which came to
the Committee touching the matter of clothing, etc.:


    ST. CATHARINES, Sept. 4th.

    DEAR SIR:--I now embrace this favorable opportunity of writing
    you a few lines to inform you that I am quite well and arrived
    here safe, and I hope that these few lines may find you and your
    family the same. I hope you will intercede for my clothes and as
    soon as they come please to send them to me, and if you have not
    time, get Dr. Lundy to look out for them, and when they come be
    very careful in sending them. I wish you would copy off this
    letter and give it to the Steward, and tell him to give it to
    Henry Lewy and tell him to give it to my wife. Brother sends his
    love to you and all the family and he is overjoyed at seeing me
    arrive safe, he can hardly contain himself; also he wants to see
    his wife very much, and says when she comes he hopes you will
    send her on as soon as possible. Jerry Williams' love, together
    with all of us. I had a message for Mr. Lundy, but I forgot it
    when I was there. No more at present, but remain your ever
    grateful and sincere friend,

    JOHN ATKINSON.





    ST. CATHARINES, C.W., Oct. 5th, 1854.

    MR. WM. STILL:--Dear Sir--I have learned of my friend, Richmond
    Bohm, that my clothes were in Philadelphia. Will you have the
    kindness to see Dr. Lundy and if he has my clothes in charge, or
    knows about them, for him to send them on to me immediately, as
    I am in great need of them. I would like to have them put in a
    small box, and the overcoat I left at your house to be put in
    the box with them, to be sent to the care of my friend, Hiram
    Wilson. On receipt of this letter, I desire you to write a few
    lines to my wife, Mary Atkins, in the care of my friend, Henry
    Lowey, stating that I am well and hearty and hoping that she is
    the same. Please tell her to remember my love to her mother and
    her cousin, Emelin, and her husband, and Thomas Hunter; also to
    my father and mother. Please request her to write to me
    immediately, for her to be of good courage, that I love her
    better than ever. I would like her to come on as soon as she
    can, but for her to write and let me know when she is going to
    start.

    Affectionately Yours,

    JOHN ATKINS.

    W.H. ATKINSON, Fugitive, Oct., 1854.

WILLIAM BUTCHER, ALIAS WILLIAM T. MITCHELL.


"HE WAS ABUSEFUL."


This passenger reported himself from Massey's Cross-Roads, near
Georgetown, Maryland. William gave as his reason for being found
destitute, and under the necessity of asking aid, that a man by the name
of William Boyer, who followed farming, had deprived him of his hard
earnings, and also claimed him as his property; and withal that he had
abused him for years, and recently had "threatened to sell" him. This
threat made his yoke too intolerable to be borne.

He here began to think and plan for the future as he had never done
before. Fortunately he was possessed with more than an average amount of
mother wit, and he soon comprehended the requirements of the Underground
Rail Road. He saw exactly that he must have resolution and
self-dependence, very decided, in order to gain the victory over Boyer.
In his hour of trial his wife, Phillis, and child, John Wesley, who were
free, caused him much anxiety; but his reason taught him that it was his
duty to throw off the yoke at all hazards, and he acted accordingly. Of
course he left behind his wife and child. The interview which the
Committee held with William was quite satisfactory, and he was duly
aided and regularly despatched by the name of William T. Mitchell. He
was about twenty-eight years of age, of medium size, and of quite a dark
hue.



"WHITE ENOUGH TO PASS."


John Wesley Gibson represented himself to be not only the slave, but
also the son of William Y. Day, of Taylor's Mount, Maryland. The
faintest shade of colored blood was hardly discernible in this
passenger. He relied wholly on his father's white blood to secure him
freedom. Having resolved to serve no longer as a slave, he concluded to
"hold up his head and put on airs." He reached Baltimore safely without
being discovered or suspected of being on the Underground Rail Road, as
far as he was aware of. Here he tried for the first time to pass for
white; the attempt proved a success beyond his expectation. Indeed he
could but wonder how it was that he had never before hit upon such an
expedient to rid himself of his unhappy lot. Although a man of only
twenty-eight years of age, he was foreman of his master's farm, but he
was not particularly favored in any way on this account. His master and
father endeavored to hold the reins very tightly upon him. Not even
allowing him the privilege of visiting around on neighboring
plantations. Perhaps the master thought the family likeness was rather
too discernible. John believed that on this account all privileges were
denied him, and he resolved to escape. His mother, Harriet, and sister,
Frances, were named as near kin whom he had left behind. John was quite
smart, and looked none the worse for having so much of his master's
blood in his veins. The master was alone to blame for John's escape, as
he passed on his (the master's) color.



[Illustration: ]

ESCAPING WITH MASTER'S CARRIAGES AND HORSES.


HARRIET SHEPHARD, AND HER FIVE CHILDREN, WITH FIVE OTHER PASSENGERS.


One morning about the first of November, in 1855, the sleepy,
slave-holding neighborhood of Chestertown, Maryland, was doubtless
deeply excited on learning that eleven head of slaves, four head of
horses, and two carriages were missing. It is but reasonable to suppose
that the first report must have produced a shock, scarcely less stunning
than an earthquake. Abolitionists, emissaries, and incendiaries were
farther below par than ever. It may be supposed that cursings and
threatenings were breathed out by a deeply agitated community for days
in succession.

Harriet Shephard, the mother of five children, for whom she felt of
course a mother's love, could not bear the thought of having her
offspring compelled to wear the miserable yoke of Slavery, as she had
been compelled to do. By her own personal experience, Harriet could very
well judge what their fate would be when reaching man and womanhood. She
declared that she had never received "kind treatment." It was not on
this account, however, that she was prompted to escape. She was actuated
by a more disinterested motive than this. She was chiefly induced to
make the bold effort to save her children from having to drag the chains
of Slavery as she herself had done.

Anna Maria, Edwin, Eliza Jane, Mary Ann, and John Henry were the names
of the children for whom she was willing to make any sacrifice. They
were young; and unable to walk, and she was penniless, and unable to
hire a conveyance, even if she had known any one who would have been
willing to risk the law in taking them a night's journey. So there was
no hope in these directions. Her rude intellect being considered, she
was entitled to a great deal of credit for seizing the horses and
carriages belonging to her master, as she did it for the liberation of
her children.

Knowing others at the same time, who were wanting to visit Canada, she
consulted with five of this class, males and females, and they mutually
decided to travel together.

It is not likely that they knew much about the roads, nevertheless they
reached Wilmington, Delaware, pretty direct, and ventured up into the
heart of the town in carriages, looking as innocent as if they were
going to meeting to hear an old-fashioned Southern sermon--"Servants,
obey your masters." Of course, the distinguished travelers were
immediately reported to the noted Thomas Garrett, who was accustomed to
transact the affairs of the Underground Rail Road in a cool masterly
way. But, on this occasion, there was but little time for deliberation,
but much need of haste to meet the emergency. He at once decided, that
they must immediately be separated from the horses and carriages, and
got out of Wilmington as quickly as possible. With the courage and
skill, so characteristic of Garrett, the fugitives, under escort, were
soon on their way to Kennett Square (a hot-bed of abolitionists and
stock-holders of the Underground Rail Road), which place they reached
safely. It so happened, that they reached Long Wood meeting-house in the
evening, at which place a fair circle had convened. Being invited, they
stayed awhile in the meeting, then, after remaining all night with one
of the Kennett friends, they were brought to Downingtown early in the
morning and thence, by daylight, within a short distance of Kimberton,
and found succor with friend Lewis, at the old headquarters of the
fugitives.

[A letter may be found from Miss G.A. Lewis, on page thirty-nine,
throwing much light on this arrival]. After receiving friendly aid and
advice while there, they were forwarded to the Committee in
Philadelphia. Here further aid was afforded them, and as danger was
quite obvious, they were completely divided and disguised, so that the
Committee felt that they might safely be sent on to Canada in one of the
regular trains considered most private.

Considering the condition of the slave mother and her children and
friends, all concerned rejoiced, that they had had the courage to use
their master's horses and vehicles as they did.



EIGHT AND A HALF MONTHS SECRETED.


WASHINGTON SOMLOR, ALIAS JAMES MOORE.


But few could tell of having been eye-witnesses to outrages more
revolting and disgraceful than Washington Somlor. He arrived per steamer
Pennsylvania (secreted), directly from Norfolk, Virginia, in 1855. He
was thirty-two years of age--a man of medium size and quite intelligent.
A merchant by the name of Smith owned Washington.

Eight and a half months before escaping, Washington had been secreted in
order to shun both master and auction-block. Smith believed in selling,
flogging, cobbing, paddling, and all other kinds of torture, by which he
could inflict punishment in order to make the slaves feel his power. He
thus tyrannized over about twenty-five head.

Being naturally passionate, when in a brutal mood, he made his slaves
suffer unmercifully. Said Washington, "On one occasion, about two months
before I was secreted, he had five of the slaves (some of them women)
tied across a barrel, lashed with the cow-hide and then cobbed--this was
a common practice."

Such treatment was so inhuman and so incredible, that the Committee
hesitated at first to give credence to the statement, and only yielded
when facts and evidences were given which seemed incontestible.

The first effort to come away was made on the steamship City of
Richmond. Within sixty miles of Philadelphia, in consequence of the ice
obstruction in the river, the steamer had to go back. How sad Washington
felt at thus having his hopes broken to pieces may be imagined but
cannot be described. Great as was his danger, when the steamer returned
to Norfolk, he was safely gotten off the boat and under the eye of
officers walked away. Again he was secreted in his old doleful quarters,
where he waited patiently for the Spring. It came. Again the opportunity
for another trial was presented, and it was seized unhesitatingly. This
time, his tried faith was rewarded with success. He came through safely
to the Committee's satisfaction as well as his own. The recital of his
sufferings and experience had a very inspiring effect on those who had
the pleasure of seeing Wash. in Philadelphia.

Although closely secreted in Norfolk, he had, through friends, some
little communication with the outside world. Among other items of
information which came to his ears, was a report that his master was
being pressed by his creditors, and had all his slaves advertised for
sale. An item still more sad also reached his ear, to the effect that
his wife had been sold away to North Carolina, and thus separated from
her child, two years old. The child was given as a present to a niece of
the master. While this is only a meagre portion of his interesting
story, it was considered at the time sufficient to identify him should
the occasion ever require it. We content ourselves, therefore, simply
with giving what was recorded on the book. Wash. spent a short while in
Philadelphia in order to recruit, after which, he went on North, where
colored men were free.

ARTHUR FOWLER, ALIAS BENJAMIN JOHNSON.


Arthur came from Spring Hill, Maryland. Edward Fowler held Arthur in
fetters and usurped authority over him as his lord and master. Arthur
saw certain signs connected with his master's family which presaged to
him that the day was not far distant, when somebody would have to be
sold to raise money to pamper the appetites of some of the superior
members of the patriarchal institution. Among these provocations were
indulgence in a great deal of extravagance, and the growing up of a
number of young masters and mistresses. Arthur would often look at the
heirs, and the very thought of their coming into possession, would make
him tremble. Nothing so affected Arthur's mind so much in moving him to
make a bold stroke for freedom as these heirs.

Under his old master, the usage had been bad enough, but he feared that
it would be a great deal worse under the sons and daughters. He
therefore wisely concluded to avoid the impending danger by availing
himself of the Underground Rail Road. After completing such arrangements
as he deemed necessary, he started, making his way along pretty
successfully, with the exception of a severe encounter with Jack Frost,
by which his feet were badly bitten. He was not discouraged, however,
but was joyful over his victory and hopeful in view of his prospects in
Canada. Arthur was about thirty years of age, medium size, and of a dark
color. The Committee afforded him needed assistance, and sent him off.

SUNDRY ARRIVALS.


About the 1st of June, 1855, the following arrivals were noted in the
record book:

EMORY ROBERTS, _alias_ WILLIAM KEMP, Talbot Co., Maryland; DANIEL PAYNE,
Richmond, Virginia; HARRIET MAYO, JOHN JUDAH, and RICHARD BRADLEY,
Petersburg and Richmond; JAMES CRUMMILL, SAMUEL JONES, TOLBERT JONES,
and HENRY HOWARD, Haverford Co., Maryland; LEWIS CHILDS, Richmond,
DANIEL BENNETT, _alias_ HENRY WASHINGTON, and wife (MARTHA,) and two
children (GEORGE and a nameless babe).

The road at this time, was doing a fair business, in a quiet way.
Passengers were managing to come, without having to suffer in any very
violent manner, as many had been called upon to do in making similar
efforts. The success attending some of these passengers was partly
attributable to the intelligence of individuals, who, for years, had
been planning and making preparations to effect the end in view.
Besides, the favorableness of the weather tended also to make travel
more pleasant than in colder seasons of the year.

While matters were thus favorable, the long stories of individual
suffering and of practices and customs among young and old masters and
mistresses, were listened to attentively, although the short summer
nights hardly afforded sufficient opportunity for writing out details.



Emory arrived safely from Talbot county. As a slave, he had served
Edward Lloyd. He gave his master the character of treating his slaves
with great severity. The "lash" was freely used "on women as well as
men, old and young." In this kind of property Lloyd had invested to the
extent of "about five hundred head," so Emory thought. Food and clothing
for this large number were dealt out very stintedly, and daily suffering
was the common lot of slaves under Lloyd.

Emory was induced to leave, to avoid a terrible flogging, which had been
promised him for the coming Monday. He was a married man, but exercised
no greater control over his wife than over himself. She was hired on a
neighboring plantation; the way did not seem open for her to accompany
him, so he had to leave her behind. His mother, brothers, and sisters
had to be left also. The ties of kindred usually strong in the breasts
of slaves, were hard for Emory to break, but, by a firm resolution, that
he would not stay on Lloyd's plantation to endure the impending
flogging, he was nerved to surmount every obstacle in the way of
carrying his intention into execution. He came to the Committee hungry
and in want of clothing, and was aided in the usual way.



Daniel Payne. This traveler was a man who might be said to be full of
years, infirm, and well-nigh used up under a Virginia task-master. But
within the old man's breast a spark was burning for freedom, and he was
desirous of reaching free land, on which to lay his body when life's
toil ended. So the Committee sympathized with him, aided him and sent
him on to Canada. He was owned by a man named M.W. Morris, of Richmond,
whence he fled.



Harriet Mayo, John Judah, and Richard Bradley were the next who brought
joy and victory with them.

Harriet was a tall, well-made, intelligent young woman, twenty-two years
of age. She spoke with feelings of much bitterness against her master,
James Cuthbert, saying that he was a "very hard man," at the same time,
adding that his "wife was still worse." Harriet "had been sold once."
She admitted however, having been treated kindly a part of her life. In
escaping, she had to leave her "poor old mother" with no hope of ever
seeing her again; likewise she regretted having to leave three brothers,
who kindly aided her to escape. But having her heart bent on freedom,
she resolved that nothing should deter her from putting forth efforts to
get out of Slavery.

John was a mulatto, of genteel address, well clothed, and looked as if
he had been "well fed." Miss Eliza Lambert had the honor of owning John,
and was gracious enough to allow him to hire his time for one hundred
and ten dollars per annum. After this sum was punctually paid, John
could do what he pleased with any surplus earnings. Now, as he was fond
of nice clothing, he was careful to earn a balance sufficient to gratify
this love. By similar means, many slaves were seen in southern cities
elegantly dressed, and, strangers and travelers from the North gave all
the credit to "indulgent masters," not knowing the facts in the case.

John accused his mistress of being hard in money matters, not caring how
the servants fared, so she got "plenty of money out of them." For
himself, however, he admitted that he had never experienced as great
abuses as many had. He was fortunate in being wedded to a free wife, who
was privy to all his plans and schemes looking forth to freedom, and
fully acquiesced in the arrangement of matters, promising to come on
after he should reach Canada. This promise was carried out in due time,
and they were joyfully re-united under the protection of the British
Lion.

Richard was about twenty-seven. For years the hope of freedom had
occupied his thoughts, and many had been the longing desires to see the
way open by which he could safely get rid of oppression. He was
sufficiently intelligent to look at Slavery in all its bearings, and to
smart keenly under even ordinarily mild treatment. Therefore, he was
very happy in the realization of his hopes. In the recital of matters
touching his slave life, he alluded to his master, Samuel Ball, as a
"very hard man," utterly unwilling to allow his servants any chance
whatever. For reasons which he considered judicious, he kept the matter
of his contemplated escape wholly private, not even revealing it to his
wife. Probably he felt that she would not be willing to give him up, not
even for freedom, as long as she could not go too. Her name was Emily,
and she belonged to William Bolden. How she felt when she learned of her
husband's escape is for the imagination to picture. These three
interesting passengers were brought away snugly secreted in Captain B's.
schooner.



JAMES CRUMMILL, SAMUAL and TOLBERT JONES and HENRY HOWARD.


This party united to throw off the yoke in Haverford county, Md.

James, Samuel and Tolbert had been owned by William Hutchins. They
agreed in giving Hutchins the character of being a notorious
"frolicker," and a "very hard master." Under him, matters were growing
"worse and worse." Before the old master's death times were much better.

Henry did not live under the same authority that his three companions
were subjected to, but belonged to Philip Garrison. The continual threat
to sell harassed Henry so much, that he saw no chance of peace or
happiness in the future. So one day the master laid the "last straw on
the camel's back," and not another day would Henry stay. Many times it
required a pretty heavy pressure to start off a number of young men, but
in this instance they seemed unwilling to wait to be worn out under the
yoke and violent treatment, or to become encumbered with wives and
children before leaving. All were single, with the exception of James,
whose wife was free, and named Charlotte; she understood about his going
to Canada, and, of course, was true to him.

These young men had of course been reared under circumstances altogether
unfavorable to mental development. Nevertheless they had fervent
aspirations to strike for freedom.



Lewis Giles belonged, in the prison-house of bondage, in the city of
Richmond, and owed service to a Mr. Lewis Hill, who made it a business
to keep slaves expressly to hire out, just as a man keeps a livery
stable. Lewis was not satisfied with this arrangement; he could see no
fair play in it. In fact, he was utterly at variance with the entire
system of Slavery, and, a long time before he left, had plans laid with
a view of escaping. Through one of the Underground Rail Road Agents the
glad tidings were borne to him that a passage might be procured on a
schooner for twenty-five dollars. Lewis at once availed himself of this
offer, and made his arrangements accordingly. He, however, made no
mention of this contemplated movement to his wife, Louisa; and, to her
astonishment, he was soon among the missing. Lewis was a fine-looking
"article," six feet high, well proportioned, and of a dark chestnut
color, worth probably $1200, in the Richmond market. Touching his slave
life, he said that he had been treated "pretty well," except that he
"had been sold several times." Intellectually he was above the average
run of slaves. He left on the twenty-third of April, and arrived about
the second of June, having, in the meantime, encountered difficulties
and discouragements of various kinds. His safe arrival, therefore, was
attended with unusual rejoicing.



Daniel Bennett and his wife and children were the next in order. A woman
poorly clad with a babe just one month old in her arms, and a little boy
at her side, who could scarcely toddle, together with a husband who had
never dared under penalty of the laws to protect her or her little ones,
presented a most painfully touching picture. It was easy enough to see,
that they had been crushed. The husband had been owned by Captain James
Taylor--the wife and children by George Carter.

The young mother gave Carter a very bad character, affirming, that it
was a "common practice with him to flog the slaves, stripped entirely
naked"--that she had herself been so flogged, since she had been a
married woman. How the husband was treated, the record book is silent.
He was about thirty-two--the wife about twenty-seven. Especial pains
were taken to provide aid and sympathy to this family in their
destitution, fleeing under such peculiarly trying circumstances and from
such loathsome brutality. They were from Aldie P.O., London County,
Virginia, and passed through the hands of the Committee about the 11th
of June. What has been their fate since is not known.

SUNDRY ARRIVALS ABOUT JANUARY FIRST, 1855.




VERENEA MERCER.


The steamship Pennsylvania, on one of her regular trips from Richmond,
brought one passenger, of whom the Captain had no knowledge; no
permission had been asked of any officer of the boat. Nevertheless,
Verenea Mercer managed, by the most extraordinary strategy, to secrete
herself on the steamer, and thus succeeded in reaching Philadelphia. She
was following her husband, who escaped about nine months before her.

Verenea was about forty-one years of age, of a dark chestnut color,
prepossessing in manners, intelligent and refined. She belonged to the
slave population of Richmond, and was owned by Thomas W. Quales.
According to her testimony, she had not received severe treatment during
the eight and a half years that she had been in his hands. Previous to
his becoming the owner of Verenea, it might have been otherwise,
although nothing is recorded in proof of this inference, except that she
had the misfortune to lose her first husband by a sale. Of course she
was left a widow, in which state she remained nine years, at the
expiration of which period, she married a man by the name of James
Mercer, whose narrative may be found on p. 54.

How James got off, and where he went, Verenea knew quite well;
consequently, in planning to reach him, she resorted to the same means
by which he achieved success. The Committee rendered her the usual aid,
and sent her on direct to her husband in Canada. Without difficulty of
any kind she reached there safely, and found James with arms wide open
to embrace her. Frequent tidings reached the Committee, that they were
getting along quite well in Toronto.



On the same day (January 1st), PETER DERRICKSON and CHARLES PURNELL
arrived from Berlin, Worcester county, Maryland. Both were able-bodied
young men, twenty-four and twenty-six years of age, just the kind that a
trader, or an experienced slave-holder in the farming business, would be
most likely to select for doing full days' work in the field, or for
bringing high prices in the market.

Peter toiled and toiled, with twenty others, on John Derrickson's farm.
And although Derrickson was said to be a "mild master," Peter decidedly
objected to working for him for nothing. He thought over his situation a
great deal, and finally came to the conclusion, that he must get from
under the yoke, if possible, before entering another New Year. His
friend Charles he felt could be confided in, therefore he made up his
mind, that he would broach the question of Canada and the Underground
Rail Road to him. Charles was equally ready and willing to enter into
any practical arrangements by which he could get rid of his no-pay
task-master, and be landed safely in Canada. After taking into account
the dangers likely to attend such a struggle, they concluded that they
would risk all and try their luck, as many had done before them.

"What made you leave, Charles?" said a member of the Committee.

"I left because I wanted my time and money for myself."

No one could gainsay such a plain common-sense answer as that. The fact,
that he had to leave his parents, three brothers, and five sisters, all
in slavery, brought sad reflections.



LLOYD HACKET, alias Perry Watkins and WILLIAM HENRY JOHNSON, alias John
Wesley.

No weather was too cold for travel, nor way too rough, when the slave
was made to feel by his heartless master, that he was going to sell him
or starve him to death.

Lloyd had toiled on until he had reached fifty-five, before he came to
the conclusion, that he could endure the treatment of his master, John
Griffin, no longer, simply because "he was not good to feed and clothe,"
and was a "great fighter." Moreover, he would "never suffer his slaves
to stop work on account of bad weather." Not only was his master cruel
in these particulars, but he was equally cruel with regard to selling.
Georgia was continually held up to the slaves with a view of producing a
wholesome fear, but in this instance, as in many similar ones, it only
awakened desires to seek flight via the Underground Rail Road.

Lloyd, convinced by experience, that matters with him would be no
better, but worse and worse, resolved that he would start with the
opening of the New Year to see if he could not find a better country
than the one that he was then in.

He consulted William, who, although a young man of only twenty-four
years of age, had the hate of slavery exceedingly strong in his heart,
and was at once willing to accompany Lloyd--ready to face cold weather
and start on a long walk if freedom could be thus purchased, and his
master, John Hall, thus defeated. So Lloyd took a heroic leave of his
wife, Mary Ann, and their little boy, one brother, one sister, and two
nieces, and at once set out with William, like pilgrims and strangers
seeking a better country--where they would not have to go "hungry" and
be "worked hard in all weather," threatened with the auction-block, and
brutally flogged if they merely seemed unwilling to endure a yoke too
grievous to be borne. Both these travelers were mulattoes, and but for
the crushing influences that they had lived under would have made smart
men--as it was they showed plainly, that they were men of shrewd sense.

Inadvertently at the time of their arrival, the names of the State and
place whence they fled were not entered on the book.

In traveling they suffered severely from hunger and the long distance
they had to walk, but having succeeded victoriously they were prepared
to rejoice all the more.



DAVID EDWARDS. John J. Slater, coachmaker of Petersburg, Virginia, if he
is still living, and should see these items, may solve what may have
been for years a great mystery to him--namely, that David, his
man-servant, was enjoying himself in Philadelphia about the first week
in January, 1855, receiving free accommodations and obtaining letters of
introduction to friends in Canada. Furthermore, that David alleged that
he was induced to escape because he (the coachmaker) was a very hard
man, who took every dollar of his earnings, from which he would dole out
to him only one dollar a week for board, etc., a sum less than David
could manage to get along with.

David was thirty years of age, black, weighed one hundred and forty-five
pounds, and was worth one thousand dollars. He left his wife behind.



BEVERLY GOOD and GEORGE WALKER, alias Austin Valentine. These passengers
came from Petersburg, per steamship Pennsylvania. Richard Perry was
lording it over Beverly, who was a young man of twenty-four years of
age, dark, medium size, and possessed of a quick intellect--just the man
that an Underground Rail Road agent in the South could approach with
assurance with questions such as these--"What do you think of Slavery?"
"Did you ever hear of the Underground Rail Road?" "How would you like to
be free?" "Would you be willing to go to Canada if you could get off
safely," etc., etc.

Such questions at once kindled into a flame the sparks of freedom lying
dormant in the heart. Although uttered in a whisper, they had a wondrous
ring about them, and a wide-awake bondman instantly grasped their
meaning. Beverly was of this class; he needed no arguments to prove that
he was daily robbed of his rights--that Slavery was merciless and
freedom the God-given right of all mankind. Of him, therefore, there was
no fear that he would betray his trust or flinch too soon when cramped
up in his hiding-place on the steamer.

His comrade, George, was likewise of the same mettle, and was aided in
the same way. George, however, had more age on his side, being about
forty-three. He was about six feet high, with marked physical and mental
abilities, but Slavery had had its heel upon his neck. And who could
then have risen?

Eliza Jones held the deed for George, and by her he was hired as foreman
in a tobacco factory, in which position his duties were
onerous--especially to one with a heavy, bleeding heart, throbbing daily
for freedom, while, at the same time, mournfully brooding over past
wrongs. Of these wrongs one incident must suffice. He had been married
twice, and had been the father of six children by his first wife; at the
command of his owner the wedded relations were abruptly broken, and he
was obliged to seek another wife. In entering this story on the book at
the time of the arrival, the concluding words were written thus: "This
story is thrilling, but time will not allow its being penned."

Although safely under the protection of the British Lion, George's heart
was in Virginia, where his wife was retained. As he could not return for
her deliverance, he was wise enough to resort to the pen, hoping in this
way to effect his grand object, as the following letter will show:


    TORONTO, January 25th, 1855.

    DEAR FRIEND STILL:--George Walker, of Petersburg, Va., is now in
    my office, and requests me to write a letter to you, and request
    you to write to his wife, after or according to the instructions
    he gave to his friend, John Brown, in your city, with whom he
    says you are acquainted. You will understand, of course, his
    reason for wanting the letter wrote and posted at Philadelphia.
    You will please attend to it and address a letter to him
    (Walker) in my care. He and Beverly Good, his comrade, tender
    much love to you. Send them on; we are prepared for them. Yours
    in great haste, J.B. SMITH.

    P.S.--Be sure and follow the directions given to Brown.




ADAM BROOKS, alias William Smith. Hardtown, Montgomery county, Maryland,
lost a rather promising "article of merchandise," in the person of Adam.
The particulars of his going are on this wise: John Phillips, his
so-called master, believed in selling, and practiced accordinglv, to the
extent at least of selling Adam's mother, brother, and sister only two
years before his escape.

If Adam had known nothing else against Phillips, this was enough in all
conscience to have awakened his deadly hate; but, added to this,
Phillips was imprudent in his habit of threatening to "sell," etc. This
kept the old wound in Adam's heart continually bleeding and forced him
to the conclusion, that his master was not only a hard man, as a driver
on the farm, but that at heart he was actually a bad man. Furthermore,
that it was his duty to break his fetters and seek his freedom in
Canada.

In thus looking at his situation, his mind was worked up to fever heat,
and he resolved that, let the consequences be what they might, go he
must. In this promising state of mind he started, at an appointed time,
for Pennsylvania, and, sure enough, he succeeded. Having the appearance
of a desirable working-hand, a Pennsylvania farmer prevailed on him to
stop for a time. It was not long before the folly of this halt was
plainly discernible, as his master had evidently got wind of his
whereabouts, and was pretty hot in pursuit. Word reached Adam, however,
barely in time for him to make his escape through the aid of friends.

In coming into the hands of the Committee he needed no persuading to go
to Canada; he was occupied with two interesting problems, to go back or
to go forward. But he set his face hopefully towards Canada, and had no
thought of stopping short thereof. In stature, he was small; color,
black; countenance, pleasant, and intellect, medium. As to his fitness
for making a good citizen in Canada the Committee had no doubt.



SARAH A. DUNAGAN. Having no one to care for her, and, having been
threatened with the auction-block, Sarah mustered pluck and started out
in search of a new home among strangers beyond the borders of slave
territory. According to her story, she "was born free" in the State of
Delaware, but had been "bound out" to a man by the name of George
Churchman, living in Wilmington. Here she averred, that she "had been
flogged repeatedly," and had been otherwise ill-treated, while no one
interfered to take her part. Consequently she concluded, that although
she was born free, she would not be likely to be benefited thereby
unless she made her escape on the Underground Rail Road. This idea of
freedom continued to agitate Sarah's mind until she decided to leave
forthwith. She was a young mulatto woman, single, and told her story of
hardships and of the dread of being sold, in a manner to elicit much
sympathy. She had a mother living in New Castle, named Ann Eliza
Kingslow. It was no uncommon thing for free-born persons in slave States
to lose their birth-right in a manner similar to that by which Sarah
feared that she had lost hers.



"Arrived JOSEPH HALL, JR., son of Joseph Hall, of Norfolk, Virginia."
This is all that is recorded of this passenger, yet it is possible that
this item of news may lead to the recognition of Joseph, should he still
happen to be of the large multitude of fugitives scattered over the land
amongst the living.



ISAAC D. DAVIS. In fleeing from bondage, in Maryland, Davis was induced
to stop, as many others were, in Pennsylvania. Not comprehending the
Fugitive Slave Law he fancied that he would be safe so long as he kept
matters private concerning his origin. But in this particular he labored
under a complete delusion--when he least dreamed of danger the
slave-catchers were scenting him close. Of their approach, however, he
was fortunate enough to be notified in time to place himself in the
hands of the Committee, who soon held out Canada to him, as the only
sure refuge for him, and all others similarly situated. His fears of
being carried back opened his eyes, and understanding, so that he could
readily see the force of this argument, and accepting the proffered aid
of the Committee was sent on his way rejoicing. He had been away from
his master eighteen months, and in the meanwhile had married a wife in
Pennsylvania. What became of them after this flight the book contains no
record.



JACOB MATTHIAS BOYER left at about the age of twenty. He had no idea of
working in the condition of a slave, but if he had not been threatened
with the auction-block, he might have remained much longer than he did.
He had been owned by Richard Carman, cashier of one of the Annapolis
banks, and who had recently died. Jacob fled from Annapolis. Very little
record was made of either master or slave. Probably no incidents were
related of sufficient importance, still the Committee felt pleased to
receive one so young. Indeed, it always afforded the Committee especial
satisfaction to see children, young people, and females escaping from
the prison-house. Jacob was of a dark hue, a little below medium
stature.



ZECHARIAH MEAD, alias John Williams. This traveler had been in the house
of bondage in Maryland, doing service for Charles C. Owens, to whom he
belonged. According to Zechariah's statement, his mistress had been very
unfortunate with her slave property, having lost fifteen head out of
twenty in a similar manner to that by which she lost Zechariah. Thus she
had been considerably reduced in circumstances. But Zechariah had no
compassion on her whatever, but insisted that she was a hard mistress.
Doubtless Zechariah was prompted to flee by the "bad" example of others
who had succeeded in making good their escape, before he had made up his
mind to leave. He was not yet quite twenty-one, but was wide-awake, and
it appeared from his conversation, that he had done some close thinking
before he started for freedom. He left his father, mother, and three
brothers, all slaves except his father.

SLAVE-HOLDER IN MARYLAND WITH THREE COLORED WIVES.


JAMES GRIFFIN ALIAS THOMAS BROWN.


James was a tiller of the soil under the yoke of Joshua Hitch, who lived
on a farm about seventeen miles from Baltimore. James spoke rather
favorably of him; indeed, it was through a direct act of kindness on the
part of his master that he procured the opportunity to make good his
escape. It appeared from his story, that his master's affairs had become
particularly embarrassed, and the Sheriff was making frequent visits to
his house. This sign was interpreted to mean that James, if not others,
would have to be sold before long. The master was much puzzled to decide
which way to turn. He owned but three other adult slaves besides James,
and they were females. One of them was his chief housekeeper, and with
them all his social relations were of such a nature as to lead James and
others to think and say that they "were all his wives." Or to use
James's own language, "he had three slave women; two were sisters, and
he lived with them all as his wives; two of them he was very fond of,"
and desired to keep them from being sold if possible. The third, he
concluded he could not save, she would have to be sold. In this dilemma,
he was good enough to allow James a few days' holiday, for the purpose
of finding him a good master. Expressing his satisfaction and
gratification, James, armed with full authority from his master to
select a choice specimen, started for Baltimore.

On reaching Baltimore, however, James carefully steered clear of all
slave-holders, and shrewdly turned his attention to the matter of
getting an Underground Rail Road ticket for Canada. After making as much
inquiry as he felt was safe, he came to the conclusion to walk of nights
for a long distance. He examined his feet and legs, found that they were
in good order, and his faith and hope strong enough to remove a
mountain. Besides several days still remained in which he was permitted
to look for a new master, and these he decided could be profitably spent
in making his way towards Canada. So off he started, at no doubt a very
diligent pace, for at the end of the first night's journey, he had made
much headway, but at the expense of his feet.

His faith was stronger than ever. So he rested next day in the woods,
concealed, of course, and the next evening started with fresh courage
and renewed perseverance. Finally, he reached Columbia, Pennsylvania,
and there he had the happiness to learn, that the mountain which at
first had tried his faith so severely, was removed, and friendly hands
were reached out and a more speedy and comfortable mode of travel
advised. He was directed to the Vigilance Committee in Philadelphia,
from whom he received friendly aid, and all necessary information
respecting Canada and how to get there.

James was thirty-one years of age, rather a fine-looking man, of a
chestnut color, and quite intelligent. He had been a married man, but
for two years before his escape, he had been a widower--that is, his
wife had been sold away from him to North Carolina, and in that space of
time he had received only three letters from her; he had given up all
hope of ever seeing her again. He had two little boys living in
Baltimore, whom he was obliged to leave. Their names were Edward and
William. What became of them afterwards was never known at the
Philadelphia station.

James's master was a man of about fifty years of age--who had never been
lawfully married, yet had a number of children on his place who were of
great concern to him in the midst of other pressing embarrassments. Of
course, the Committee never learned how matters were settled after James
left, but, in all probability, his wives, Nancy and Mary (sisters), and
Lizzie, with all the children, had to be sold.

CAPTAIN F. ARRIVES WITH NINE PASSENGERS.




NAMES OF PASSENGERS.


PETER HEINES, Eatontown, North Carolina; MATTHEW BODAMS, Plymouth, North
Carolina; JAMES MORRIS, South End, North Carolina; CHARLES THOMPSON,
CHARITY THOMPSON, NATHANIEL BOWSER, and THOMAS COOPER, Portsmouth,
Virginia; GEORGE ANDERSON, Elkton, Maryland.

Their arrival was announced by Thomas Garrett as follows:


    WILMINGTON, 7th mo., 19th, 1856.

    RESPECTED FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--I now have the pleasure of
    consigning to thy care four able-bodied human beings from North
    Carolina, and five from Virginia, one of which is a girl twelve
    or thirteen years of age, the rest all men. After thee has seen
    and conversed with them, thee can determine what is best to be
    done with them. I am assured they are such as can take good care
    of themselves. Elijah Pennypacker, some time since, informed me
    he could find employment in his neighborhood for two or three
    good hands. I should think that those from Carolina would be
    about as safe in that neighborhood as any place this side of
    Canada. Wishing our friends a safe trip, I remain thy sincere
    friend,

    THOS. GARRETT.

    After conferring with Harry Craige, we have concluded to send
    five or six of them tonight in the cars, and the balance, if
    those go safe, to-morrow night, or in the steam-boat on Second
    day morning, directed to the Anti-Slavery office.


There was much rejoicing over these select passengers, and very much
interesting information was elicited from them.



Peter was only twenty-one years of age, composed of equal parts of
Anglo-Saxon and Anglo-African blood--rather a model-looking "article,"
with a fair share of intelligence. As a slave, he had fared pretty
well--he had neither been abused nor stinted of food or clothing, as
many others had been. His duties had been to attend upon his master (and
reputed father), Elias Heines, Esq., a lawyer by profession in North
Carolina.

No charges whatever appear to have been made against Mr. Heines,
according to the record book; but Peter seemed filled with great delight
at the prospects ahead, as well as with the success that had attended
his efforts thus far in striking for freedom.



James was twenty-seven years of age. His experience had been quite
different from that of Peter's. The heel of a woman, by the name of Mrs.
Ann McCourt, had been on James's neck, and she had caused him to suffer
severely. As James recounted his grievances, while under the rule, he by
no means gave her a very flattering character, but, on the contrary, he
plainly stated, that she was a "desperate woman"--that he had "never
known any good of her," and that he was moved to escape to get rid of
her. In other words she had threatened to sell him; this well nigh
produced frenzy in James's mind, for too well did he remember, that he
had already been sold three times, and in different stages of his
bondage had been treated quite cruelly. In the change of masters he was
positive in saying, that he had not found a good one, and, besides, he
entertained the belief that such personages were very rare.

Those of the Committee who listened to James were not a little amazed at
his fluency, intelligence and earnestness, and acknowledged that he
dealt unusually telling blows against the Patriarchal Institution.



Matthew was twenty-three years of age, very stout--no fool--a man of
decided resolution, and of the very best black complexion produced in
the South. Matthew had a very serious bill of complaints against Samuel
Simmons, who professed to own him (Matthew), both body and mind, while
in this world at least. Among these complaints was the charge of
ill-treatment. Nevertheless Matthew's joy and pleasure were matchless
over his Underground Rail Road triumph, and the prospect of being so
soon out of the land and reach of Slavery, and in a land where he could
enjoy his freedom as others enjoyed theirs. Indeed the entire band
evinced similar feelings. Matthew left a brother in Martin county.

Further sketches of this interesting company were not entered on the
book at the time, perhaps on account of the great press of Underground
Rail Road business which engaged the attention of the acting Committee.
However, they were all duly cared for, and counselled to go to Canada,
where their rights would be protected by a strong and powerful
government, and they could enjoy all the rights of citizenship in common
with "all the world and the rest of mankind." And especially were they
advised to get education; to act as men, and remember those still in
bonds as bound with them, and that they must not forget to write back,
after their arrival in Canada, to inform their friends in Philadelphia
of their prospects, and what they thought of the "goodly land." Thus,
with the usual Underground Rail Road passports, they were again started
Canada-ward. Without difficulty of any kind they duly reached Canada,
and a portion of them wrote back as follows:


    "TORONTO, C.W., Aug. 17th, 1856.

    MR, STILL:--Dear Sir--These few lines may find you as they leave
    us, we are well at present and arrived safe in Toronto. Give our
    respects to Mrs. S.---- and daughter. Toronto is a very
    extensive place. We have plenty of pork, beef and mutton. There
    are five market houses and many churches. Female wages is 62-1/2
    cents per day, men's wages is $1 and york shilling. We are now
    boarding at Mr. George Blunt's, on Centre street, two doors from
    Elm, back of Lawyer's Hall, and when you write to us, direct
    your letter to the care of Mr. George Blunt, &c. (Signed), James
    Monroe, Peter Heines, Henry James Morris, and Matthew Bodame."


This intelligence was very gratifying, and most assuredly added to the
pleasurable contemplation of having the privilege of holding out a
helping hand to the fleeing bondman. From James Morris, one of this
company, however, letters of a painful nature were received, touching
his wife in bonds, setting forth her "awful" situation and appealing to
the Committee to use their best endeavors to rescue her, with her child,
from Slavery. One of these letters, so full of touching sentiments of
affection and appeal on behalf of his wife, is as follows:


    TORONTO, Canada West, upper, 18th day of the 9th mo., 1856.

    MR. WILLIAM STILL:--Dear Sir--I hope these lines may find you
    and your family as they leave me give my respects to little
    Caroline and her mother.

    Dear Sir, I have received two letters from my wife since I saw
    you, and the second was awful. I am sorry to say she says she
    has been treated awful since I left, and she told the lady she
    thought she was left free and she told her she was as much slave
    as ever she was that the state was not to be settled until her
    death and it would be a meracle if she and her child got it then
    and that her master left a great many relations and she diden no
    what they would do. Mr. Still dear sir I am very sorry to hear
    my wife and child are slaves if you please dear sir inform me
    what to do for my dear wife and child. She said she has been
    threatened to be put in jail three times since I left also she
    tells me that she is washing for the captain of a vesel that use
    to run to Petersburg but now he runs to Baltimore and he has
    promas to take her to Delaware or New York for 50 dollars and
    she had not the money, she sent to me and I sent her all I had
    which was 5 dollars dear sir can you inform me what to do with a
    case of this kind the captains name is Thomas.

    My wife is name lucy an morris my child is name lot, if you
    please dear sir answer me as soon as you can posable.

    HENRY JAMES MORRIS, Toronto C.W.

    Henry James Morris in care of Wm. George Blunt, Centre st., 2
    doors from Elam.


This sad letter made a mournful impression, as it was not easy to see
how her deliverance was to be effected. One feature, however, about this
epistle afforded much satisfaction, namely, to know, that James did not
forget his poor wife and child, who were in the prison-house. Many
months after this first letter came to hand, Mrs. Dr. Willis, one of the
first ladies in Toronto, wrote on his behalf as follows:


    TORONTO, 15th June, Monday morning, 1857.

    To MR. STILL, DEAR SIR:--I write you this letter for a
    respectable young man (his name is James Morris), he passed
    through your hands July of last year (1856), and has just had a
    letter from his wife, whom he left behind in Virginia, that she
    and her child are likely to be sold. He is very anxious about
    this and wishful that she could get away by some vessel or
    otherwise. His wife's name is Lucy Morris; the child's name is
    Lot Morris; the lady's name she lives with is a Mrs. Hine (I
    hope I spell her name right, Hine), at the corner of Duke street
    and Washington street, in Norfolk city, Virginia. She is hired
    out to this rich old widow lady. James Morris wishes me to write
    you--he has saved forty dollars, and will send it to you
    whenever it is required, to bring her on to Toronto, Canada
    West. It is in the bank ready upon call. Will you please, sir,
    direct your letter in reply to this, to a Mrs. Ringgold, Centre
    street, two doors from Elam street, Toronto, Canada West, as I
    will be out of town. I write this instead of Mr. Thomas Henning,
    who is just about leaving for England. Hoping you will reply
    soon, I remain, sir,

    Respectfully yours,

    AGNES WILLIS.


Whether James ever succeeded in recovering his wife and child, is not
known to the writer. Many similarly situated were wont to appeal again
and again, until growing entirely hopeless, they would conclude to
marry.

Here it may be remarked, with reference to marrying, that of the great
number of fugitives in Canada, the male sex was largely in preponderance
over the female, and many of them were single young men. This class
found themselves very acceptable to Irish girls, and frequently legal
alliances were the result. And it is more than likely, that there are
white women in Canada to-day, who are married to some poor slave woman's
fugitive husband.

Verily, the romantic and tragic phases of the Underground Rail Road are
without number, if not past finding out.

Scarcely had the above-mentioned nine left the Philadelphia depot, ere
the following way-worn travelers came to hand:



PERRY SHEPHARD, and ISAAC REED, Eastern Shore, Maryland; GEORGE
SPERRYMAN, _alias_ THOMAS JOHNSON, Richmond; VALENTINE SPIRES, near
Petersburg; DANIEL GREEN, _alias_ GEORGE TAYLOR, Leesburg, Virginia;
JAMES JOHNSON, _alias_ WILLIAM GILBERT and wife HARRIET, Prince George's
county, Maryland; HENRY COOPER, and WILLIAM ISRAEL SMITH, Middletown,
Delaware; ANNA DORSEY, Maryland.

Although starting from widely separated localities without the slightest
communication with each other in the South, each separate passenger
earnestly bent on freedom, had endured suffering, hunger, and perils, by
land and water, sustained by the hope of ultimate freedom.



PERRY SHEPHARD and ISAAC REED reported themselves as having fled from
the Eastern Shore of Maryland; that they had there been held to service
or Slavery by Sarah Ann Burgess, and Benjamin Franklin Houston, from
whom they fled. No incidents of slave life or travel were recorded, save
that Perry left his wife Milky Ann, and two children, Nancy and Rebecca
(free). Also Isaac left his wife, Hester Ann Louisa, and the following
named children: Philip Henry, Harriet Ann and Jane Elizabeth.



GEORGE SPERRYMAN'S lot was cast amongst the oppressed in the city of
Richmond, Va. Of the common ills of slave life, George could speak from
experience; but little of his story, however, was recorded at the time.
He had reached the Committee through the regular channel--was adjudged
worthy of aid and encouragement, and they gave it to him freely.
Nickless Templeman was the loser in this instance; how he bore the
misfortune the Committee was not apprised. Without question, the
property was delighted with getting rid of the owner.



VALENTINE SPIRES came a fellow-passenger with George, having "took out"
the previous Christmas, from a place called Dunwoody, near Petersburg.
He was held to service in that place by Dr. Jesse Squires. Under his
oppressive rules and demands, Valentine had been convinced that there
could be no peace, consequently he turned his attention to one
idea--freedom and the Underground Rail Road, and with this faith, worked
his way through to the Committee, and was received, and aided of course.



DAVID GREEN, fled from Warrington, near Leesburg. Elliott Curlett so
alarmed David by threatening to sell him, that the idea of liberty
immediately took possession in David's mind. David had suffered many
hardships at the hands of his master, but when the auction-block was
held up to him, that was the worst cut of all. He became a thinker right
away. Although he had a wife and one child in Slavery, he decided to
flee for his freedom at all hazards, and accordingly he carried out his
firm resolution.



JAMES JOHNSON. This "article" was doing unrequited labor as the slave of
Thomas Wallace, in Prince George county, Maryland. He was a stout and
rugged-looking man, of thirty-five years of age. On escaping, he was
fortunate enough to bring his wife, Harriet with him. She was ten years
younger than himself, and had been owned by William T. Wood, by whom she
said that she had "been well treated." But of late, this Wood had taken
to liquor, and she felt in danger of being sold. She knew that rum
ruined the best of slave-holders, so she was admonished to get out of
danger as soon as possible.



CHARLES HENRY COOPER and WILLIAM ISRAEL SMITH. These passengers were
representatives of the peculiar Institution of Middletown, Delaware.
Charles was owned by Catharine Mendine, and William by John P. Cather.
According to their confession, Charles and William it seemed had been
thinking a good deal over the idea of "working for nothing," of being
daily driven to support others, while they were rendered miserable
thereby. So they made up their minds to try the Underground Rail Road,
"hit or miss." This resolution was made and carried into effect (on the
part of Charles at least), at the cost of leaving a mother, three
brothers, and three sisters in Slavery, without hope of ever seeing them
again. The ages of Charles and William were respectively twenty-two and
twenty-one. Both stout and well-made young men, with intellects well
qualified to make the wilderness of Canada bud and blossom as the rose,
and thitherward they were dispatched.



ANNA DORSET became tired of Slavery in Maryland, where she reported that
she had been held to service by a slave-holder, known by the name of Eli
Molesworth. The record is silent as to how she was treated. As a slave,
she had been brought up a seamstress, and was quite intelligent. Age
twenty-two, mulatto.

OWEN AND OTHO TAYLOR'S FLIGHT WITH HORSES, ETC.


THREE BROTHERS, TWO OF THEM WITH WIVES AND CHILDREN.


About the latter part of March, 1856, Owen Taylor and his wife, Mary
Ann, and their little son, Edward, together with a brother and his wife
and two children, and a third brother, Benjamin, arrived from near Clear
Springs, nine miles from Hagerstown, Maryland. They all left their home,
or rather escaped from the prison-house, on Easter Sunday, and came
_viâ_ Harrisburg, where they were assisted and directed to the Vigilance
Committee in Philadelphia. A more interesting party had not reached the
Committee for a long time.

The three brothers were intelligent, and heroic, and, in the resolve to
obtain freedom, not only for themselves, but for their wives and
children desperately in earnest. They had counted well the cost of this
struggle for liberty, and had fully made up their minds that if
interfered with by slave-catchers, somebody would have to bite the dust.
That they had pledged themselves never to surrender alive, was obvious.
Their travel-worn appearance, their attachment for each other, the joy
that the tokens of friendship afforded them, the description they gave
of incidents on the road, made an impression not soon to be effaced.

In the presence of a group like this Sumner's great and eloquent speech
on the Barbarism of Slavery, seemed almost cold and dead,--the mute
appeals of these little ones in their mother's arms--the unlettered
language of these young mothers, striving to save their offspring from
the doom of Slavery--the resolute and manly bearing of these brothers
expressed in words full of love of liberty, and of the determination to
resist Slavery to the death, in defence of their wives and
children--this was Sumner's speech enacted before our eyes.

Owen was about thirty-one years of age, but had experienced a deal of
trouble. He had been married twice, and both wives were believed to be
living. The first one, with their little child, had been sold in the
Baltimore market, about three years before, the mother was sent to
Louisiana, the child to South Carolina. Father, mother, and child,
parted with no hope of ever seeing each other again in this world. After
Owen's wife was sent South, he sent her his likeness and a dress; the
latter was received, and she was greatly delighted with it, but he never
heard of her having received his likeness. He likewise wrote to her, but
he was not sure that she received his letters. Finally, he came to the
conclusion that as she was forever dead to him, he would do well to
marry again. Accordingly he took to himself another partner, the one who
now accompanied him on the Underground Rail Road.

Omitting other interesting incidents, a reference to his handiwork will
suffice to show the ability of Owen. Owen was a born mechanic, and his
master practically tested his skill in various ways; sometimes in the
blacksmith shop--at other times as a wheelwright--again at making
brushes and brooms, and at leisure times he would try his hand in all
these crafts. This Jack-of-all-trades was, of course, very valuable to
his master. Indeed his place was hard to fill.

Henry Fiery, a farmer, "about sixty-four years of age, a stout, crusty
old fellow," was the owner of Owen and his two brothers. Besides slaves,
the old man was in possession of a wife, whose name was Martha, and
seven children, who were pretty well grown up. One of the sons owned
Owen's wife and two children. Owen declared, that they had been worked
hard, while few privileges had been allowed them. Clothing of the
poorest texture was only sparingly furnished. Nothing like Sunday
raiment was ever given them; for these comforts they were compelled to
do over-work of nights. For a long time the idea of escape had been
uppermost in the minds of this party. The first of January, past, was
the time "solemnly" fixed upon to "took out," but for some reason or
other (not found on the record book), their strategical minds did not
see the way altogether clear, and they deferred starting until Easter
Sunday.

On that memorable evening, the men boldly harnessed two of Mr. Fiery's
steeds and placing their wives and children in the carriage, started off
_viâ_ Hagerstown, in a direct line for Chambersburg, Pennsylvania, at a
rate that allowed no grass to grow under the horses' feet. In this
manner they made good time, reached Chambersburg safely, and ventured up
to a hotel where they put up their horses. Here they bade their faithful
beasts good-bye and "took out" for Harrisburg by another mode of travel,
the cars. On their arrival they naturally fell into the hands of the
Committee, who hurried them off to Philadelphia, apprising the Committee
there of their approach by a dispatch sent ahead. Probably they had
scarcely reached Philadelphia ere the Fierys were in hot haste after
them, as far as Harrisburg, if not farther.

It hardly need be hinted, that the community in which the Fierys lived
was deeply agitated for days after, as indeed it was along the entire
route to Chambersburg, in consequence of this bold and successful
movement. The horses were easily captured at the hotel, where they were
left, but, of course, they were mute as to what had become of their
drivers. The furious Fierys probably got wind of the fact, that they had
made their way to Harrisburg. At any rate they made very diligent search
at this point. While here prosecuting his hunting operations, Fiery
managed to open communication with at least one member of the Harrisburg
Committee, to whom his grievances were made known, but derived little
satisfaction.

After the experience of a few weeks, the pursuers came to the
conclusion, that there was no likelihood of recovering them through
these agencies, or through the Fugitive Slave Law. In their despair,
therefore, they resorted to another "dodge." All at once they became
"sort-o'-friendly"--indeed more than half disposed to emancipate. The
member of the Committee in Harrisburg had, it is probable, frequently
left room for their great delusion, if he did not even go so far as to
feed their hopes with plausible suggestions, that some assistance might
be afforded by which an amicable settlement might be made between
masters and slaves.

The following extract, from the Committee's letter, relative to this
matter, is open to this inference, and may serve to throw some light on
the subject:


    HARRISBURG, April 28, '56.

    Friend Still:--Your last came to hand in due season, and I am
    happy to hear of the safe arrival of those gents.

    I have before me the Power of Attorney of Mr. John S. Fiery, son
    of Mr. Henry Fiery, of Washington county, Md., the owner of
    those three men, two women and three children, who arrived in
    your town on the 24th or 25th of March. He graciously
    condescends to liberate the oldest in a year, and the remainder
    in proportional time, if they will come back; or to sell them
    their time for $1300. He is sick of the job, and is ready to
    make any conditions. Now, if you personally can get word to them
    and get them to send him a letter, in my charge, informing him
    of their whereabouts and prospects, I think it will be the best
    answer I can make him. He will return here in a week or two, to
    know what can be done. He offers $500 to see them.

    Or if you can send me word where they are, I will endeavor to
    write to them for his special satisfaction; or if you cannot do
    either, send me your latest information, for I intend to make
    him spend a few more dollars, and if possible get a little
    sicker of this bad job. Do try and send him a few bitter pills
    for his weak nerves and disturbed mind.

    Yours in great haste,

    Jos. C. Bustill.


A subsequent letter from Mr. Bustill contains, besides other interesting
Underground Rail Road matter, an item relative to the feeling of
disappointment experienced by Mr. Fiery on learning that his property
was in Canada.


    HARRISBURG, May 26, '56.

    Friend Still:--I embrace the opportunity presented by the visit
    of our friend, John F. Williams, to drop you a few lines in
    relation to our future operations.

    The Lightning Train was put on the Road on last Monday, and as
    the traveling season has commenced and this is the Southern
    route for Niagara Falls, I have concluded not to send by way of
    Auburn, except in cases of great danger; but hereafter we will
    use the Lightning Train, which leaves here at 1-1/2 and arrives
    in your city at 5 o'clock in the morning, and I will telegraph
    about 5-1/2 o'clock in the afternoon, so it may reach you before
    you close. These four are the only ones that have come since my
    last. The woman has been here some time waiting for her child
    and her beau, which she expects here about the first of June. If
    possible, please keep a knowledge of her whereabouts, to enable
    me to inform him if he comes.

    _I have nothing more to send you, except that John Fiery has
    visited us again and much to his chagrin received the
    information of their being in Canada_.

    Yours as ever,

    Jos. C. Bustill.

    Whilst the Fierys were working like beavers to re-enslave these
    brave fugitives, the latter were daily drinking in more and more
    of the spirit of freedom and were busy with schemes for the
    deliverance of other near kin left behind under the galling
    yoke.

    Several very interesting letters were received from Otho Taylor,
    relative to a raid he designed making expressly to effect the
    escape of his family. The two subjoined must suffice, (others,
    much longer, cannot now be produced, they have probably been
    loaned and not returned.)


        APRIL 15th, 1857.

        SIR--We arrived here safely. Mr. Syrus and his lady is
        well situated. They have a place for the year round 15
        dollars per month. We are all well and hope that you are
        all the same. Now I wish to know whether you would
        please to send me some money to go after those people.
        Send it here if you please.

        Yours truly,

        OTHO TAYLOR.

        WILLIAM STILL.


    ST. CATHARINES, Jan. 26, 1857.

    MR. WM. STILL:--Dear Sir--I write at this time in behalf of Otho
    Taylor. He is very anxious to go and get his family at Clear
    Spring, Washington county, Md. He would like to know if the
    Society there would furnish him the means to go after them from
    Philadelphia, that you will be running no risk in doing this. If
    the Society can do this, he would not be absent from P. more
    than three days.

    He is so anxious to get his family from slavery that he is
    willing to do almost anything to get them to Canada. You may
    possibly recollect him--he was at your place last August. I
    think he can be trusted. If you can do something for him, he has
    the means to take him to your place.

    Please let me know immediately if you can do this.

    Respectfully yours,

    M.A.H. WILSON.


Such appeals came very frequently from Canada, causing much sadness, as
but little encouragement could be held out to such projects. In the
first place, the danger attendant upon such expeditions was so fearful,
and in the second place, our funds were so inadequate for this kind of
work, that, in most cases, such appeals had to be refused. Of course,
there were those whose continual coming, like the poor widow in the
Gospel, could not be denied.

HEAVY REWARD.



    THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber,
    residing near Bladensburg, Prince George's county, Maryland, on
    Saturday night, the 22d of March, 1856, my negro man, Tom
    Matthews, aged about 25 years, about 5 feet 9 or 10 inches high,
    dark copper color, full suit of bushy hair, broad face, with
    high cheek bones, broad and square shoulders, stands and walks
    very erect, though quite a sluggard in action, except in a
    dance, at which he is hard to beat. He wore away a black coat
    and brown pantaloons. I will give the above reward if taken and
    brought home, or secured in jail, so that I get him.

    [Illustration: ]

    E.A. JONES, near Bladensburg, Md.


As Mr. Jones may be unaware which way his man Tom traveled, this item
may inform him that his name was entered on the Underground Rail Road
book April 4th, 1856, at which date he appeared to be in good health and
full of hope for a safe sojourn in Canada. He was destitute, of course,
just as anybody else would have been, if robbers had stripped him of
every dollar of his earnings; but he felt pretty sure, that he could
take care of himself in her Majesty's dominion.

The Committee, encouraged by his efforts, reached him a helping hand and
sent him on to swell the goodly number in the promised land--Canada.

On the same day that Tom arrived, the Committee had the pleasure of
taking JAMES JONES by the hand. He was owned by Dr. William Stewart, of
King George's Court House, Maryland. He was not, however, in the service
of his master at the time of his escape but was hired out in Alexandria.
For some reason, not noticed in the book, James became dissatisfied,
changed his name to Henry Rider, got an Underground Rail Road pass and
left the Dr. and his other associations in Maryland. He was one of the
well-cared for "articles," and was of very near kin to the white people,
at least a half-brother (mulatto, of course). He was thirty-two years of
age, medium size, hard-featured and raw-boned, but "no marks about him."

James looked as if he had had pretty good health, still the Committee
thought that he would have much better in Canada. After hearing a full
description of that country and of the great number of fugitives there
from Maryland and other parts of the South, "Jim" felt that that was
just the place he wanted to find, and was soon off with a free ticket, a
letter of introduction, etc.

CAPTAIN F. ARRIVES WITH FOURTEEN "PRIME ARTICLES" ON BOARD.


Thomas Garrett announced this in the following letter:


    WILMINGTON, 3d mo., 23d, 1856.

    DEAR FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--Captain Fountain has arrived all
    safe, with the human cargo thee was inquiring for, a few days
    since. I had men waiting till 12 o'clock till the Captain
    arrived at his berth, ready to receive them; last night they
    then learned, that he had landed them at the Rocks, near the old
    Swedes church, in the care of our efficient Pilot, who is in the
    employ of my friend, John Hillis, and he has them now in charge.
    As soon as my breakfast is over, I will see Hillis and determine
    what is best to be done in their case. My own opinion is, we had
    better send them to Hook and there put them in the cars to-night
    and send a pilot to take them to thy house. As Marcus Hook is in
    Pennsylvania, the agent of the cars runs no risk of the fine of
    five hundred dollars our State imposes for assisting one of
    God's poor out of the State by steamboat or cars.

    As ever thy friend,

    THOS. GAREETT.




NAMES OF THE "ARTICLES."


Rebecca Jones, and her three daughters, Sarah Frances, Mary, and
Rebecca; Isaiah Robinson, Arthur Spence, Caroline Taylor, and her two
daughters, Nancy, and Mary; Daniel Robinson; Thomas Page; Benjamin
Dickinson; David Cole and wife.

From the tenor of Thomas Garrett's letter, the Committee was prepared
for a joyful reception, knowing that Captain F. was not in the habit of
doing things by the halves--that he was not in the habit of bringing
numbskulls; indeed he brought none but the bravest and most intelligent.
Yet notwithstanding our knowledge of his practice in this respect, when
he arrived we were surprised beyond measure. The women outnumbered the
men. The two young mothers, with their interesting, hearty and
fine-looking children representing in blood the two races about
equally--presented a very impressive spectacle.

The men had the appearance of being active, smart, and well disposed,
much above the generality of slaves; but, compared with those of the
opposite sex, their claims for sympathy were very faint indeed. No one
could possibly avoid the conclusion, that these mothers, with their
handsome daughters, were valued on the Ledger of their owners at
enormously high prices; that lustful traders and sensualists had already
gloated over the thought of buying them in a few short years. Probably
not one of those beautiful girls would have brought less than fifteen
hundred or two thousand dollars at the age of fifteen. It was therefore
a great satisfaction to think, that their mothers, who knew full well to
what a fate such slave girls were destined, had labored so heroically to
snatch them out of this danger ere the critical hour arrived.



Rebecca Jones was about twenty-eight years of age; mulatto,
good-looking, considerably above medium size, very intelligent, and a
true-born heroine.

The following reward, offered by the notorious negro-trader, Hall,
proved that Rebecca and her children were not to be allowed to go free,
if slave-hunters could be induced by a heavy pecuniary consideration to
recapture them:


    $300 REWARD is offered for the apprehension of negro woman,
    REBECCA JONES and her three children, and man ISAIAH, belonging
    to W.W. Davidson, who have disappeared since the 20th inst. The
    above reward will be paid for the apprehension and delivery of
    the said Negroes to my Jail, by the attorney in fact of the
    owner, or the sum of $250 for the man alone, or $150 for the
    woman and three children alone.

    [Illustration: ]

    WM. W. HALL, for the Attorney, feb. 1.


Years before her escape, her mistress died in England; and as Rebecca
had always understood, long before this event, that all the slaves were
to be freed at the death of her mistress, she was not prepared to
believe any other report. It turned out, however, as in thousands of
other instances, that no will could be found, and, of course, the
administrators retained the slave property, regardless of any verbal
expressions respecting freeing, etc. Rebecca closely watched the course
of the administrators, and in the meanwhile firmly resolved, that
neither she nor her children should ever serve another master. Rather
than submit, she declared that she would take the lives of her children
and then her own. Notwithstanding her bold and decided stand, the report
went out that she was to be sold, and that all the slaves were still to
be held in bondage. Rebecca's sympathizers and friends advised her, as
they thought for the best, to get a friend or gentleman to purchase her
for herself. To this she replied: "Not three cents would I give, nor do
I want any of my friends to buy me, not if they could get me for three
cents. It would be of no use," she contended, "as she was fully bent on
dying, rather than remain a slave." The slave-holders evidently
understood her, and were in no hurry about bringing her case to an
issue--they rather gave her time to become calm. But Rebecca was
inflexible.

Six years before her arrival, her husband had escaped, in company with
the noted fugitive, "Shadrach." For a time after he fled, she frequently
received letters from him, but for a long while he had ceased to write,
and of late she had heard nothing from him.

In escaping stowed away in the boat, she suffered terribly, but
faithfully endured to the end, and was only too happy when the agony was
over. After resting and getting thoroughly refreshed in Philadelphia,
she, with others, was forwarded to Boston, for her heart was there.
Several letters were received from her, respecting her prospects, etc.,
from which it appears that she had gained some knowledge of her husband,
although not of a satisfactory nature. At any rate she decided that she
could not receive him back again. The following letter has reference to
her prospects, going to California, her husband, etc.:


    PARKER HOUSE, School street, Boston, Oct. 18th, '56.

    MY DEAR SIR:--I can hardly express the pleasure I feel at the
    receipt of your kind letter; but allow me to thank you for the
    same.

    And now I will tell you my reasons for going to California. Mrs.
    Tarrol, a cousin of my husband, has sent for me. She says I can
    do much better there than in Boston. And as I have my children's
    welfare to look to, I have concluded to go. Of course I shall be
    just as likely to hear from home _there_ as _here_. Please tell
    Mr. Bagnale I shall expect one letter from him before I leave
    here.

    I should like to hear from my brothers and sisters once more,
    and let me hear every particular. You never can know how anxious
    I am to hear from them; do please impress this upon their minds.

    I have written two letters to Dr. Lundy and never received an
    answer. I heard Mrs. Lundy was dead, and thought that might
    possibly be the reason he had not replied to me. Please tell the
    Doctor I should take it as a great favor if he would write me a
    few lines.

    I suppose you think I am going to live with my husband again.
    Let me assure you 'tis no such thing. My mind is as firm as
    ever. And believe me, in going away from Boston, I am going away
    from him, for I have heard he is living somewhere near. He has
    been making inquiries about me, but that can make no difference
    in my feelings to him. I hope that yourself, wife and family are
    all quite well. Please remember me to them all. Do me the favor
    to give my love to all inquiring friends. I should be most happy
    to have any letters of introduction you may think me worthy of,
    and I trust I shall ever remain

    Yours faithfully,

    REBECCA JONES.

    P.S.--I do not know if I shall go this Fall, or in the Spring.
    It will depend upon the letter I receive from California, but
    whichever it may be, I shall be happy to hear from you very
    soon.




Isaiah, who was a fellow-servant with Rebecca, and was included in the
reward offered by Hall for Rebecca, etc., was a young man about
twenty-three years of age, a mulatto, intelligent and of prepossessing
manners. A purely ardent thirst for liberty prompted him to flee;
although he declared that he had been treated very badly, and had even
suffered severely from being shamefully "beaten." He had, however, been
permitted to hire his time by the year, for which one hundred and twenty
dollars were regularly demanded by his owner. Young as he was, he was a
married man, with a wife and two children, to whom he was devoted. He
had besides two brothers and two sisters for whom he felt a warm degree
of brotherly affection; yet when the hour arrived for him to accept a
chance for freedom at the apparent sacrifice of these dearest ties of
kindred, he was found heroic enough for this painful ordeal, and to give
up all for freedom.



Caroline Taylor, and her two little children, were also from Norfolk,
and came by boat. Upon the whole, they were not less interesting than
Rebecca Jones and her three little girls. Although Caroline was not in
her person half so stately, nor gave such promise of heroism as
Rebecca--for Caroline was rather small of stature--yet she was more
refined, and quite as intelligent as Rebecca, and represented
considerably more of the Anglo-Saxon blood. She was a mulatto, and her
children were almost fair enough to pass for white--probably they were
quadroons, hardly any one would have suspected that they had only one
quarter of colored blood in their veins. For ten years Caroline had been
in the habit of hiring her time at the rate of seventy-five dollars per
year, with the exception of the last year, when her hire was raised to
eighty-four dollars. So anxious was she to have her older girl (eleven
years old) at home with her, that she also hired her time by the year,
for which she was compelled to pay twenty-four dollars. As her younger
child was not sufficiently grown to hire out for pay, she was permitted
to have it at home with her on the conditions that she would feed,
clothe and take good care of it, permitting no expense whatever to fall
upon the master.

Judging from the appearance and manners of the children, their mother
had, doubtless, been most faithful to them, for more handsome,
well-behaved, intelligent and pleasing children could not easily be
selected from either race or any station of life. The younger, Mary by
name, nine years of age, attracted very great attention, by the deep
interest she manifested in a poor fugitive (whom she had never seen
before), at the Philadelphia station, confined to the bed and suffering
excruciating pain from wounds he had received whilst escaping. Hours and
hours together, during the two or three days of their sojourn, she spent
of her own accord, by his bed-side, manifesting almost womanly sympathy
in the most devoted and tender manner. She thus, doubtless,
unconsciously imparted to the sufferer a great deal of comfort. Very
many affecting incidents had come under the observation of the acting
Committee, under various circumstances, but never before had they
witnessed a sight more interesting, a scene more touching.

Caroline and her children were owned by Peter March, Esq., late of
Norfolk, but at that time, he was living in New York, and was carrying
on the iron business. He came into possession of them through his wife,
who was the daughter of Caroline's former master, and almost the only
heir left, in consequence of the terrible fever of the previous summer.
Caroline was living under the daily fear of being sold; this, together
with the task of supporting herself and two children, made her burden
very grievous. Not a great while before her escape, her New York master
had been on to Norfolk, expressly with a view of selling her, and asked
two thousand dollars for her. This, however, he failed to get, and was
still awaiting an offer.

These ill omens aroused Caroline to think more seriously over the
condition of herself and children than she had ever done before, and in
this state of mind she came to the conclusion, that she would strive to
save herself and children by flight on the Underground Rail Road. She
knew full well, that it was no faint-hearted struggle that was required
of her, so she had nerved herself with the old martyr spirit to risk her
all on her faith in God and Freedom, and was ready to take the
consequences if she fell back into the hands of the enemy. This noble
decision was the crowning act in the undertakings of thousands similarly
situated. Through this faith she gained the liberty of herself and her
children. Quite a number of the friends of the slave saw these
interesting fugitives, and wept, and rejoiced with them.

Col. A. Cammings, in those days Publisher of the "Evening Bulletin," for
the first time, witnessed an Underground Rail Road arrival. Some time
previous, in conversation with Mr. J.M. McKim, the Colonel had expressed
views not altogether favorable to the Underground Rail Road; indeed he
was rather inclined to apologize for slavery, if not to defend the
Fugitive Slave Law. While endeavoring somewhat tenaciously to maintain
his ground, Mr. McKim opposed to him not only the now well established
Anti-Slavery doctrines, but also offered as testimony Underground Rail
Road facts--the results of personal knowledge from daily proofs of the
heroic struggles, marvellous faith, and intense earnestness of the
fugitives.

In all probability the Colonel did not feel prepared to deny wholly Mr.
McKim's statement, yet, he desired to see "some" for himself. "Well,"
said Mr. McK., "you shall see some." So when this arrival came to hand,
true to his promise, Mr. McK. called on the Colonel and invited him to
accompany him to the Underground Rail Road station. He assured the
Colonel that he did not want any money from him, but simply wanted to
convince him of his error in the recent argument that they had held on
the subject. Accordingly the Colonel accompanied him, and found that
twenty-two passengers had been on hand within the past twenty-four
hours, and at least sixteen or seventeen were then in his presence. It
is needless to say, that such a sight admitted of no contradiction--no
argument--no doubt. The facts were too self-evident. The Colonel could
say but little, so complete was his amazement; but he voluntarily
attested the thoroughness of his conversion by pulling out of his pocket
and handing to Mr. McK. a twenty dollar gold piece to aid the passengers
on to freedom.



In these hours of rest and joyful anticipation the necessities of both
large and small were administered to according to their needs, before
forwarding them still further. The time and attention required for so
many left but little opportunity, however, for the Secretary to write
their narratives. He had only evening leisure for the work. Ten or
twelve of that party had to be sent off without having their stories
recorded. Daniel Robertson was one of this number; his name is simply
entered on the roll, and, but for letters received from him, after he
passed on North, no further knowledge would have been obtained. In
Petersburg, whence he escaped, he left his wife, for whose deliverance
he felt bound to do everything that lay in his power, as the subjoined
letters will attest:


    HAVANA, August 11, 1856, Schuylkill Co., N.Y.

    MR. WM. STILL--Dear Sir:--I came from Virginia in March, and was
    at your office the last of March. My object in writing you, is
    to inquire what I can do, or what can be done to help my wife to
    escape from the same bondage that I was in. You will know by
    your books that I was from Petersburg, Va., and that is where my
    wife now is. I have received two or three letters from a lady in
    that place, and the last one says, that my wife's mistress is
    dead, and that she expects to be sold. I am very anxious to do
    what I can for her before it is too late, and beg of you to
    devise some means to get her away. Capt. the man that brought me
    away, knows the colored agent at Petersburg, and knows he will
    do all he can to forward my wife. The Capt. promised, that when
    I could raise one hundred dollars for him that he would deliver
    her in Philadelphia. Tell him that I can now raise the money,
    and will forward it to you at any day that he thinks that he can
    bring her. Please see the Captain and find when he will
    undertake it, and then let me know when to forward the money to
    you. I am at work for the Hon. Charles Cook, and can send the
    money any day. My wife's name is Harriet Robertson, and the
    agent at Petersburg knows her.

    Please direct your answer, with all necessary directions, to N.
    Coryell, of this village, and he will see that all is right.

    Very respectfully,

    DANIEL ROBERTSON.





    HAVANA, Aug. 18, 1856.

    MR. WM. STILL--Dear Sir:--Yours of the 18th, for D. Robertson,
    was duly received. In behalf of Daniel, I thank you kindly for
    the interest you manifest in him. The letters that have gone
    from him to his friends in Virginia, have been written by me,
    and sent in such a manner as we thought would best ensure
    safety. Yet I am well aware of the risk of writing, and have
    restrained him as far as possible, and the last one I wrote was
    to be the last, till an effort was made to reclaim his wife.
    Daniel is a faithful, likely man, and is well liked by all who
    know him. He is industrious and prudent, and is bending his
    whole energies toward the reclaiming his wife. He can forward to
    you the one hundred dollars at any day that it may be wanted,
    and if you can do anything to forward his interests it will be
    very gratefully received as an additional favor on your part. He
    asks for no money, but your kindly efforts, which he regards
    more highly than money.

    Very respectfully, N. CORYELL.

    The letters that have been written for him were dated "Niagara
    Falls, Canada West," and his friends think he is there--none of
    them know to the contrary--it is important that they never do
    know. N.C.





    HAVANA, Sept. 29, 1856.

    MR. WM. STILL--Dear Sir:--I enclose herewith a draft on New
    York, payable to your order, for $100, to be paid on the
    delivery at Philadelphia of Daniel Robertson's wife.

    You can readily see that it has been necessary for Daniel to
    work almost night and day to have laid up so large an amount of
    money, since the first of April, as this one hundred dollars.
    Daniel is industrious and prudent, and saves all of his
    earnings, above his most absolute wants. If the Captain is not
    successful in getting Daniel's wife, you, of course, will return
    the draft, without charge, as you said. I hope success will
    attend him, for Daniel deserves to be rewarded, if ever man did.
    Yours, &c.

    N. CORYELL.





    HAVANA, Jan. 2, 1857.

    DEAR SIR:--Your favor containing draft on N. York, for Daniel
    Robertson, came to hand on the 31st ult. Daniel begs to tender
    his acknowledgments for your kind interest manifested in his
    behalf, and says he hopes you will leave no measure untried
    which has any appearance of success, and that the money shall be
    forthcoming at a moment's notice. Daniel thinks that since
    Christmas, the chances for his wife's deliverance are fewer than
    before, for at that time he fears she was disposed of and
    possibly went South.

    The paper sent me, with your well-written article, was received,
    and on reading it to Daniel, he knew some of the parties
    mentioned in it--he was much pleased to hear it read. Daniel
    spent New Year's in Elmira, about 18 miles from this place, and
    there he met two whom he was well acquainted with.

    Yours, &c.,

    N. CORYELL.

    WM. STILL, Esq., Phila.


Such devotion to freedom, such untiring labor, such appeals as these
letters contained awakened deep interest in the breasts of Daniel's new
friends, which spoke volumes in favor of the Slave and against
slave-holders. But, alas, nothing could be done to relieve the sorrowing
mind of poor Daniel for the deliverance of his wife in chains. The
Committee sympathized deeply with him, but could do no more. What other
events followed, in Daniel's life as a fugitive, were never made known
to the Committee.



Arthur Spence also deserves a notice. He was from North Carolina, about
twenty-four years of age, and of pleasing appearance, and was heart and
soul in sympathy with the cause of the Underground Rail Road. In North
Carolina he declared that he had been heavily oppressed by being
compelled to pay $175 per annum for his hire. In order to get rid of
this heavy load, by shrewd management he gained access to the
kind-hearted Captain and procured an Underground Rail Road ticket. In
leaving bondage, he was obliged to leave his mother, two brothers and
one sister. He appeared to be composed of just the kind of material for
making a good British subject.



Ben Dickinson. Ben was also a slave in North Carolina--located at
Eatontown, being the property of "Miss Ann Blunt, who was very hard." In
slave property Miss Blunt was interested to the number of about "ninety
head." She was much in the habit of hiring out servants, and in thus
disposing of her slaves Ben thought she was a great deal more concerned
in getting good prices for herself than good places for them. Indeed he
declared that "she did not care how mean the place was, if she could
only get her price." For three years Ben had Canada and the Underground
Rail Road in view, having been "badly treated." At last the long-looked
for time arrived, and he conferred neither with master nor mistress, but
"picked himself up" and "took out." Age twenty-eight, medium size, quite
dark, a good carpenter, and generally intelligent. Left two sisters,
etc.

Of this heroic and promising party we can only mention, in conclusion,
one more passenger, namely:



Tom Page. At the time of his arrival, his name only was enrolled on the
book. Yet he was not a passenger soon to be forgotten--he was but a mere
boy, probably eighteen years of age; but a more apt, ready-witted,
active, intelligent and self-reliant fellow is not often seen.

Judging from his smartness, under slavery, with no chances, it was easy
to imagine how creditably he might with a white boy's chances have
climbed the hill of art and science. Obviously he had intellect enough,
if properly cultivated, to fill any station within the ordinary reach of
intelligent American citizens. He could read and write remarkably well
for a slave, and well did he understand his advantages in this
particular; indeed if slave-holders had only been aware of the growing
tendency of Tom's mind, they would have rejoiced at hearing of his
departure for Canada; he was a most dangerous piece of property to be
growing up amongst slaves.

After leaving the Committee and going North his uncaged mind felt the
need of more education, and at the same time he was eager to make money,
and do something in life. As he had no one to depend on, parents and
relatives being left behind in Norfolk, he felt that he must rely upon
himself, young as he was. He first took up his abode in Boston, or New
Bedford, where most of the party with whom he escaped went, and where he
had an aunt, and perhaps some other distant kin. There he worked and was
a live young man indeed--among the foremost in ideas and notions about
freedom, etc., as many letters from him bore evidence. After spending a
year or more in Massachusetts, he had a desire to see how the fugitives
were doing in Upper and Lower Canada, and if any better chances existed
in these parts for men of his stamp.

Some of his letters, from different places, gave proof of real thought
and close observation, but they were not generally saved, probably were
loaned to be read by friendly eyes. Nevertheless the two subjoined will,
in a measure, suffice to give some idea of his intelligence, etc.


    BOSTON, Mass., Feb. 25th, 1857.

    WILLIAM STILL, Esq.:--Dear Sir--I have not heard from you for
    some time. I take this opportunity of writing you a few lines to
    let you and all know that I am well at present and thank God for
    it. Dear Sir, I hear that the under ground railroad was in
    operation. I am glad to hear that. Give my best respects to your
    family and also to Dr. L., Mr. Warrick, Mr. Camp and familys, to
    Mr. Fisher, Mr. Taylor to all Friends names too numerous to
    mention. Please to let me know when the road arrived with
    another cargo. I want to come to see you all before long, if
    nothing happens and life lasts. Mrs. Gault requested me to learn
    of you if you ask Mr. Bagnal if he will see father and what he
    says about the children. Please to answer as soon as possible.
    No more at present from a friend,

    THOMAS F. PAGE.





    NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y., Oct. 6th, '58.

    DEAR SIR:--I received your kind letter and I was very glad to
    hear from you and your family. This leaves me well, and I hope
    when this comes to hand it may find you the same. I have seen a
    large number of your U.G.R.R. friends in my travels through the
    Eastern as well as the Western States. Well there are a good
    many from my own city who I know--some I talk to on private
    matters and some I wont. Well around here there are so
    many--Tom, Dick and Harry--that you do not know who your friend
    is. So it don't hurt any one to be careful. Well, somehow or
    another, I do not like Canada, or the Provinces. I have been to
    St. John, N.B., Lower Province, or Lower Canada, also St.
    Catharines, C.W., and all around the Canada side, and I do not
    like it at all. The people seem to be so queer--though I suppose
    if I had of went to Canada when I first came North to live, I
    might like it by this time. I was home when Aunt had her
    Ambro-type taken for you. She often speaks of your kindness to
    her. There are a number of your friends wishes you well. My
    little brother is going to school in Boston. The lady, Mrs.
    Hillard, that my Aunt lives with, thinks a good deal of him. He
    is very smart and I think, if he lives, he may be of some
    account. Do you ever see my old friend, Capt. Fountain? Please
    to give my love to him, and tell him to come to Boston, as there
    are a number of his friends that would like to see him. My best
    respects to all friends. I must now bring my short epistle to a
    close, by saying I remain your friend truly,

    THOMAS F. PAGE.


While a portion of the party, on hand with him, came as passengers with
Capt. P., another portion was brought by Capt. B., both parties arriving
within twelve hours of each other; and both had likewise been frozen up
on the route for weeks with their respective live freight on board.

The sufferings for food, which they were called upon to endure, were
beyond description. They happened to have plenty of salt fat pork, and
perhaps beans, Indian meal and some potatoes for standing dishes; the
more delicate necessaries did not probably last longer than the first or
second week of their ice-bondage.

Without a doubt, one of these Captains left Norfolk about the twentieth
of January, but did not reach Philadelphia till about the twentieth of
March, having been frozen up, of course, during the greater part of that
time. Men, women and children were alike sharers in the common struggle
for freedom--were alike an hungered, in prison, naked, and sick, but it
was a fearful thing in those days for even women and children to whisper
their sad lamentations in the city of Philadelphia, except to those
friendly to the Underground Rail Road.

Doubtless, if these mothers, with their children and partners in
tribulation, could have been seen as they arrived direct from the boats,
many hearts would have melted, and many tears would have found their way
down many cheeks. But at that time cotton was acknowledged to be
King--the Fugitive Slave Law was supreme, and the notorious decision of
Judge Taney, that "black men had no rights which white men were bound to
respect," echoed the prejudices of the masses too clearly to have made
it safe to reveal the fact of their arrival, or even the heart-rending
condition of these Fugitives.

Nevertheless, they were not turned away empty, though at a peril they
were fed, aided, and comforted, and sent away well clothed. Indeed, so
bountifully were the women and children supplied, that as they were
being conveyed to the Camden and Amboy station, they looked more like a
pleasuring party than like fugitives. Some of the good friends of the
slave sent clothing, and likewise cheered them with their presence.

[Before the close of this volume, such friends and sympathizers will be
more particularly noticed in an appropriate place.]

SUNDRY ARRIVALS--LATTER PART OF DECEMBER, 1855, AND BEGINNING OF
JANUARY, 1856.


JOSEPH CORNISH, Dorchester Co., Md.; LEWIS FRANCIS, _alias_ LEWIS
JOHNSON, Harford Co., Md.; ALEXANDER MUNSON, Chestertown, Md.; SAMUEL
and ANN SCOTT, Cecil Cross-Roads, Md.; WM. HENRY LAMINSON, Del.; ISAAC
STOUT, _alias_ GEORGE WASHINGTON, CAROLINE GRAVES, Md.; HENRY and ELIZA
WASHINGTON, Alexandria, Va.; HENRY CHAMBERS, JOHN CHAMBERS, SAMUEL FALL,
and THOMAS ANDERSON, Md.



Joseph Cornish was about forty years of age when he escaped. The heavy
bonds of Slavery made him miserable. He was a man of much natural
ability, quite dark, well-made, and said that he had been "worked very
hard." According to his statement, he had been an "acceptable preacher
in the African Methodist Church," and was also "respected by the
respectable white and colored people in his neighborhood." He would not
have escaped but for fear of being sold, as he had a wife and five
children to whom he was very much attached, but had to leave them
behind. Fortunately they were free.

Of his ministry and connection with the Church, he spoke with feelings
of apparent solemnity, evidently under the impression that the little
flock he left would be without a shepherd. Of his master, Captain Samuel
Le Count, of the U.S. Navy, he had not one good word to speak; at least
nothing of the kind is found on the Record Book; but, on the contrary,
he declared that "he was very hard on his servants, allowing them no
chance whatever to make a little ready money for themselves." So in
turning his face towards the Underground Rail Road, and his back against
slavery, he felt that he was doing God service.

The Committee regarded him as a remarkable man, and was much impressed
with his story, and felt it to be a privilege and a pleasure to aid him.



Lewis Francis was a man of medium size, twenty-seven years of age,
good-looking and intelligent. He stated that he belonged to Mrs.
Delinas, of Abingdon, Harford Co., Md., but that he had been hired out
from a boy to a barber in Baltimore. For his hire his mistress received
eight dollars per month.

To encourage Lewis, his kind-hearted mistress allowed him out of his own
wages the sum of two dollars and fifty cents per annum! His clothing he
got as best he could, but nothing did she allow him for that purpose.
Even with this arrangement she had been dissatisfied of late years, and
thought she was not getting enough out of Lewis; she, therefore, talked
strongly of selling him. This threat was very annoying to Lewis, so much
so, that he made up his mind that he would one day let her see, that so
far as he was concerned, it was easier to talk of selling than it would
be to carry out her threat.

With this growing desire for freedom he gained what little light he
could on the subject of traveling, Canada, etc., and at a given time off
he started on his journey and found his way to the Committee, who
imparted substantial aid as usual.



Alexander Munson, alias Samuel Garrett. This candidate for Canada was
only eighteen years of age; a well-grown lad, however, and had the one
idea that "all men were born free" pretty deeply rooted in his mind. He
was quite smart, and of a chestnut color. By the will of his original
owner, the slaves were all entitled to their freedom, but it appeared,
from Alexander's story, that the executor of the estate did not regard
this freedom clause in the will. He had already sold some of the slaves,
and others--he among them--were expecting to be sold before coming into
possession of their freedom. Two of them had been sold to Alabama,
therefore, with these evil warnings, young Alexander resolved to strike
out at once for Canada, despite Maryland slave-holders. With this bold
and manly spirit he succeeded, of course.



Anna Scott and husband, Samuel Scott. This couple escaped from Cecil
Cross-Roads, Md. The wife, in this instance, evidently took the lead,
and acted the more manly part in striking for freedom; therefore, our
notice of this arrival will chiefly relate to her..

Anna was owned by a widow, named Mrs. Ann Elizabeth Lushy, who resided
on a farm of her own. Fifteen slaves, with other stock, were kept on the
place. She was accustomed to rule with severity, being governed by a
"high temper," and in nowise disposed to allow her slaves to enjoy even
ordinary privileges, and besides, would occasionally sell to the
Southern market. She was calculated to render slave life very unhappy.
Anna portrayed her mistress's treatment of the slaves with much
earnestness, especially when referring to the sale of her own brother
and sister. Upon the whole, the mistress was so hateful to Anna, that
she resolved not to live in the house with her. During several years
prior to her escape, Anna had been hired out, where she had been treated
a little more decently than her mistress was wont to do; on this account
she was less willing to put up with any subsequent abuse from her
mistress.

To escape was the only remedy, so she made up her mind, that she would
leave at all hazards. She gave her husband to understand, that she had
resolved to seek a home in Canada. Fortunately, he was free, but slavery
had many ways of putting the yoke on the colored man, even though he
might be free; it was bound to keep him in ignorance, and at the same
time miserably abject, so that he would scarcely dare to look up in the
presence of white people.

Sam, apparently, was one of the number who had been greatly wronged in
this particular. He had less spirit than his wife, who had been directly
goaded to desperation. He agreed, however, to stand by her in her
struggles while fleeing, and did so, for which he deserves credit. It
must be admitted, that it required some considerable nerve for a free
man even to join his wife in an effort of this character. In setting
out, Anna had to leave her father (Jacob Trusty), seven sisters and two
brothers. The names of the sisters were as follows: Emeline, Susan Ann,
Delilah, Mary Eliza, Rosetta, Effie Ellender and Elizabeth; the
brothers--Emson and Perry. For the commencement of their journey they
availed themselves of the Christmas holidays, but had to suffer from the
cold weather they encountered. Yet they got along tolerably well, and
were much cheered by the attention and aid they received from the
Committee.



William Henry Laminson came from near Newcastle, Delaware. He was smart
enough to take advantage of the opportunity to escape at the age of
twenty-one. As he had given the matter his fullest attention for a long
time, he was prepared to make rapid progress when he did start, and as
he had no great distance to travel it is not unlikely, that while his
master was one night sleeping soundly, this young piece of property
(worth at least $1,000 in the market), was crossing Mason and Dixon's
Line, and steering directly for Canada. Francis Harkins was the name of
the master. William did not give him a very bad character.



George Washington Gooseberry, alias Isaac Stout, also took advantage of
the holidays to separate from his old master, Anthony Rybold, a farmer
living near Newcastle, Delaware. Nothing but the desire to be free moved
George to escape. He was a young man about twenty-three years of age, of
a pure black color, in stature, medium size, and well-made. Nothing
remarkable is noted in the book in any way connected with his life or
escape.



Caroline Graves. Caroline was of the bond class belonging to the State
of Maryland. Having reached the age of forty without being content, and
seeing no bright prospect in the future, she made up her mind to break
away from the bonds of Slavery and seek a more congenial atmosphere
among strangers in Canada. She had had the privilege of trying two
masters in her life-time; the first she admitted was "kind" to her, but
the latter was "cruel." After arriving in Canada, she wrote back as
follows:


    TORONTO, Jan. 22, 1856.

    DEAR SIR:--WILLIAM STILL--I have found my company they arrived
    here on monday eving I found them on tusday evening. Please to
    be so kind as to send them boxes we are here without close to
    ware we have some white frendes is goin to pay for them at this
    end of the road. The reason that we send this note we are afraid
    the outher one woudent go strait because it wasent derected
    wright. Please to send them by the express then thay wont be
    lost. Please to derect these boxes for Carline Graives in the
    car of mrs. Brittion. Please to send the bil of the boxes on
    with them. Mrs. Brittion, Lousig street near young street.




George Graham and wife, Jane, alias Henry Washington and Eliza. The cold
weather of January was preferred, in this instance, for traveling.
Indeed matters were so disagreeable with them that they could not tarry
in their then quarters any longer. George was twenty-four years of age,
quite smart, pleasant countenance, and of dark complexion.

He had experienced "rough usage" all the way along through life, not
unfrequently from severe floggings. Twice, within the last year, he had
been sold. In order to prevent a renewal of these inflictions he
resorted to the Underground Rail Road with his wife, to whom he had only
been married six months.

In one sense, they appeared to be in a sad condition, it being the dead
of winter, but their condition in Alexandria, under a brutal master and
mistress which both had the misfortune to have, was much sadder. To give
all their due, however, George's wife acknowledged, that she had been
"well treated under her old mistress," but through a change, she had
fallen into the hands of a "new one," by whom her life had been rendered
most "miserable;" so much so, that she was willing to do almost anything
to get rid of her, and was, therefore, driven to join her husband in
running away.



Henry Chambers, John Chambers, Samuel Fall, and Jonathan Fisher. This
party represented the more promising-looking field-hand slave population
of Maryland. Henry and John were brothers, twenty-four and twenty-six
years of age, stout made, chestnut color, good-looking, but in height
not quite medium. Henry "owed service or labor," to a fellow-man by the
name of William Rybold, a farmer living near Sassafras Neck, Md. Henry
evidently felt, that he did master Rybold no injustice in testifying
that he knew no good of him, although he had labored under him like a
beast of burden all his days. He had been "clothed meanly," and "poorly
fed." He also alleged, that his mistress was worse than his master, as
she would "think nothing of knocking and beating the slave women for
nothing." John was owned by Thomas Murphy. From that day to this, Thomas
may have been troubling his brain to know why his man John treated him
so shabbily as to leave him in the manner that he did. Jack had a good
reason for his course, nevertheless. In his corn field-phrase he
declared, that his master Murphy would not give you half clothes, and
besides he was a "hard man," who kept Jack working out on hire.
Therefore, feeling his wrongs keenly, Jack decided, with his other
friends, to run off and be free.

Sam, another comrade, was also owned by William Rybold. Sam had just
arrived at his maturity (twenty-one), when he was invited to join in the
plot to escape. At first, it might be thought strange, why one so young
should seek to escape. A few brief words from Sam soon explained the
mystery. It was this: his master, as he said, had been in the habit of
tying him up by the hands and flogging him unmercifully; besides, in the
allowance of food and clothing, he always "stinted the slaves yet worked
them very hard." Sam's chances for education had been very unfavorable,
but he had mind enough to know that liberty was worth struggling for. He
was willing to make the trial with the other boys. He was of a dark
chestnut color, and of medium size.

Jonathan belonged to A. Rybold, and was only nineteen years of age. All
that need be said in relation to his testimony, is, that it agreed with
his colleague's and fellow-servant's, Samuel. Before starting on their
journey, they felt the need of new names, and in putting their wits
together, they soon fixed this matter by deciding to pass in future by
the following names: James and David Green, John Henry, and Jonathan
Fisher.

In the brief sketches given in this chapter, some lost ones, seeking
information of relatives, may find comfort, even if the general reader
should fail to be interested.



PART OF THE ARRIVALS IN DECEMBER, 1855.




THOMAS JERVIS GOOSEBERRY and WILLIAM THOMAS FREEMAN, _alias_ EZEKIEL
CHAMBERS; HENRY HOOPER; JACOB HALL, _alias_ HENRY THOMAS, and wife,
HENRIETTA and child; Two men from near Chestertown, Md.; FENTON JONES;
MARY CURTIS; WILLIAM BROWN; CHARLES HENRY BROWN; OLIVER PURNELL and
ISAAC FIDGET.



Thomas Jervis Gooseberry and William Thomas Freeman. The coming of this
party was announced in the subjoined letter:


    SCHUYLKILL, 11th Mo., 29th, 1855.

    WILLIAM STILL: DEAR FRIEND:--Those boys will be along by the
    last Norristown train to-morrow evening. I think the train
    leaves Norristown at 6 o'clock, but of this inform thyself. The
    boys will be sent to a friend at Norristown, with instructions
    to assist them in getting seats in the last train that leaves
    Norristown to-morrow evening. They are two of the eleven who
    left some time since, and took with them some of their master's
    horses; I have told them to remain in the cars at Green street
    until somebody meets them.

    E.F. PENNYPACKER.


Having arrived safely, by the way and manner indicated in E.F.
Pennypacker's note, as they were found to be only sixteen and seventeen
years of age, considerable interest was felt by the Acting Committee to
hear their story. They were closely questioned in the usual manner. They
proved to be quite intelligent, considering how young they were, and how
the harrow of Slavery had been upon them from infancy.

They escaped from Chestertown, Md., in company with nine others (they
being a portion of the eleven who arrived in Wilmington, with two
carriages, etc., noticed on page 302), but, for prudential reasons they
were separated while traveling. Some were sent on, but the boys had to
be retained with friends in the country. Many such separations were
inevitable. In this respect a great deal of care and trouble had to be
endured for the sake of the cause.

Thomas Jervis, the elder boy, was quite dark, and stammered somewhat,
yet he was active and smart. He stated that Sarah Maria Perkins was his
mistress in Maryland. He was disposed to speak rather favorably of her,
at least he said that she was "tolerably kind" to her servants. She,
however, was in the habit of hiring out, to reap a greater revenue for
them, and did not always get them places where they were treated as well
as she herself treated them. Tom left his father, Thomas Gooseberry, and
three sisters, Julia Ann, Mary Ellen, and Katie Bright, all slaves.

Ezekiel, the younger boy, was of a chestnut color, clever-looking,
smart, and well-grown, just such an one as a father enjoying the
blessings of education and citizenship, might have felt a considerable
degree of pride in. He was owned by a man called John Dwa, who followed
"farming and drinking," and when under the influence of liquor, was
disposed to ill-treat the slaves. Ezekiel had not seen his mother for
many years, although she was living in Baltimore, and was known by the
name of "Dorcas Denby." He left no brothers nor sisters.

The idea of boys, so young and inexperienced as they were, being thrown
on the world, gave occasion for serious reflection. Still the Committee
were rejoiced that they were thus early in life, getting away from the
"Sum of all villanies." In talking with them, the Committee endeavored
to impress them with right ideas as to how they should walk in life,
aided them, of course, and sent them off with a double share of advice.
What has been their destiny since, is not known.



Henry Hooper, a young man of nineteen years of age, came from Maryland,
in December, in a subsequent Underground Rail Road arrival. That he came
in good order, and was aided and sent off, was fully enough stated on
the book, but nothing else; space, however was left for the writing out
of his narrative, but it was never filled up. Probably the loose sheet
on which the items were jotted down, was lost.



Jacob Hall, alias Henry Thomas, wife Henrietta, and child, were also
among the December passengers. On the subject of freedom they were
thoroughly converted. Although Jacob was only about twenty years of age,
he had seen enough of Slavery under his master, "Major William
Hutchins," whom he described as a "farmer, commissioner, drunkard, and
hard master," to know that no hope could be expected from him, but if he
remained, he would daily have to be under the "harrow." The desire to
work for himself was so strong, that he could not reconcile his mind to
the demands of Slavery. While meditating upon freedom, he concluded to
make an effort with his wife and child to go to Canada.

His wife, Henrietta, who was then owned by a woman named Sarah Ann
McGough, was as unhappily situated as himself. Indeed Henrietta had come
to the conclusion, that it was out of the question for a servant to
please her mistress, it mattered not how hard she might try; she also
said, that her mistress drank, and that made her "wus."

Besides, she had sold Henrietta's brother and sister, and was then
taking steps to sell her,--had just had her appraised with this view. It
was quite easy, therefore, looking at their condition in the light of
these plain facts, for both husband and wife to agree, that they could
not make their condition any worse, even if they should be captured in
attempting to escape. Henrietta also remembered, that years before her
mother had escaped, and got off to Canada, which was an additional
encouragement. Thus, as her own faith was strengthened, she could
strengthen that of her husband.

Their little child they resolved to cling to through thick and thin; so,
in order that they might not have so far to carry him, father and mother
each bridled a horse and "took out" in the direction of the first
Underground Rail Road station. Their faithful animals proved of
incalculable service, but they were obliged to turn them loose on the
road without even having the opportunity or pleasure of rewarding them
with a bountiful feed of oats.

Although they had strange roads, woods and night scenes to pass through,
yet they faltered not. They found friends and advisers on the road,
however, and reached the Committee in safety, who was made to rejoice
that such promising-looking "property" could come out of Ladies' Manor,
Maryland. The Committee felt that they had acted wisely in taking the
horses to assist them the first night.



The next arrival is recorded thus: "Dec. 10, 1855, Arrived, two men from
near Chestertown, Md. They came to Wilmington in a one horse wagon, and
through aid of T.G. they were sent on." (Further account at the time,
written on a loose piece of paper, is among the missing).



Fenton Jones escaped from Frederick, Md. After arriving in the
neighborhood of Ereildoun, Pa., he was induced to tarry awhile for the
purpose of earning means to carry him still farther. But he was soon led
to apprehend danger, and was advised and directed to apply to the
Vigilance Committee of Philadelphia for the needed aid, which he did,
and was dispatched forthwith to Canada.



About the same time a young woman arrived, calling herself Mary Curtis.
She was from Baltimore, and was prompted to escape to keep from being
sold. She was nineteen years of age, small size, dark complexion. No
special incidents in her life were noted.



William Brown came next. If others had managed to make their way out of
the prison-house without great difficulties, it was far from William to
meet with such good luck, as he had suffered excessively for five weeks
while traveling. It was an easy matter for a traveler to get lost, not
knowing the roads, nor was it safe to apply to a stranger for
information or direction--therefore, in many instances, the journey
would either have to be given up, or be prosecuted, suffering almost to
the death.

In the trying circumstances in which William found himself, dark as
everything looked, he could not consent to return to his master, as he
felt persuaded, that if he did, there would be no rest on earth for him.
He well remembered, that, because he had resisted being flogged (being
high spirited), his master had declined to sell him for the express
purpose of making an example of him--as a warning to the other slaves on
the place. William was as much opposed to being thus made use of as he
was to being flogged. His reflections and his stout heart enabled him to
endure five weeks of severe suffering while fleeing from oppression. Of
course, when he did succeed, the triumph was unspeakably joyous.
Doubtless, he had thought a great deal during this time, and being an
intelligent fugitive, he interested the Committee greatly.

The man that he escaped from was called William Elliott, a farmer,
living in Prince George's county, Md. William Elliott claimed the right
to flog and used it too. William, however, gave him the character of
being among the moderate slave-holders of that part of the country. This
was certainly a charitable view. William was of a chestnut color, well
made, and would have commanded, under the "hammer," a high price, if his
apparent intelligence had not damaged him. He left his father,
grand-mother, four sisters and two brothers, all living where he fled
from.



Charles Henry Brown. This "chattel" was owned by Dr. Richard Dorsey, of
Cambridge, Maryland. Up to twenty-seven years of age, he had experienced
and observed how slaves were treated in his neighborhood, and he made up
his mind that he was not in favor of the Institution in any form
whatever. Indeed he felt, that for a man to put his hand in his
neighbor's pocket and rob him, was nothing compared to the taking of a
man's hard earnings from year to year. Really Charles reasoned the case
so well, in his uncultured country phrases, that the Committee was
rather surprised, and admired his spirit in escaping. He was a man of
not quite medium size, with marked features of mind and character.



Oliver Purnell and Isaac Fidget arrived from Berlin, Md. Each had
different owners. Oliver stated that Mose Purnell had owned him, and
that he was a tolerably moderate kind of a slave-holder, although he was
occasionally subject to fractious turns. Oliver simply gave as his
reason for leaving in the manner that he did, that he wanted his "own
earnings." He felt that he had as good a right to the fruit of his labor
as anybody else. Despite all the pro-slavery teachings he had listened
to all his life, he was far from siding with the pro-slavery doctrines.
He was about twenty-six years of age, chestnut color, wide awake and a
man of promise; yet it was sadly obvious that he had been blighted and
cursed by slavery even in its mildest forms. He left his parents, two
brothers and three sisters all slaves in the hands of Purnell, the
master whom he deserted.

Isaac, his companion, was about thirty years of age, dark, and in
intellect about equal to the average passengers on the Underground Rail
Road. He had a very lively hope of finding his wife in freedom, she
having escaped the previous Spring; but of her whereabouts he was
ignorant, as he had had no tidings of her since her departure. A lady by
the name of Mrs. Fidget held the deed for Isaac. He spoke kindly of her,
as he thought she treated her slaves quite as well at least as the best
of slave-holders in his neighborhood. His view was a superficial one, it
meant only that they had not been beaten and starved half to death.



As the heroic adventures and sufferings of Slaves struggling for
freedom, shall be read by coming generations, were it not for
unquestioned statutes upholding Slavery in its dreadful heinousness,
people will hardly be able to believe that such atrocities were enacted
in the nineteenth century, under a highly enlightened, Christianized,
and civilized government. Having already copied a statute enacted by the
State of Virginia, as a sample of Southern State laws, it seems fitting
that the Fugitive Slave Bill, enacted by the Congress of the United
States, shall be also copied, in order to commemorate that most infamous
deed, by which, it may be seen, how great were the bulwarks of
oppression to be surmounted by all who sought to obtain freedom by
flight.



THE FUGITIVE SLAVE BILL OF 1850.


"AN ACT RESPECTING FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE, AND PERSONS ESCAPING FROM THE
SERVICE OF THEIR MASTERS."



    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the
    United States of America in Congress assembled:

    That the persons who have been, or may hereafter be appointed
    commissioners, in virtue of any Act of Congress, by the circuit
    courts of the United States, and who, in consequence of such
    appointment, are authorized to exercise the powers that any
    justice of the peace or other magistrate of any of the United
    States, may exercise in respect to offenders for any crime or
    offence against the United States, by arresting, imprisoning, or
    bailing the same under and by virtue of the thirty-third section
    of the act of the twenty-fourth of September, seventeen hundred
    and eighty-nine, entitled, "An act to establish the judicial
    courts of the United States," shall be, and are hereby
    authorized and required to exercise and discharge all the powers
    and duties conferred by this act.

    Sec. 2. And be it further enacted: That the superior court of
    each organized territory of the United States, shall have the
    same power to appoint commissioners to take acknowledgments of
    bail and affidavit, and to take depositions of witnesses in
    civil causes, which is now possessed by the circuit courts of
    the United States, and all commissioners, who shall hereafter be
    appointed for such purposes, by the superior court of any
    organized territory of the United States, shall possess all the
    powers, and exercise all the duties conferred by law, upon the
    commissioners appointed by the circuit courts of the United
    States for similar purposes, and shall, moreover, exercise and
    discharge all the powers and duties conferred by this act.

    SEC. 3. And be it further enacted: That the circuit courts of
    the United States, and the superior courts of each organized
    territory of the United States, shall, from time to time,
    enlarge the number of Commissioners, with a view to afford
    reasonable facilities to reclaim fugitives from labor, and to
    the prompt discharge of the duties imposed by this act.

    SEC. 4. And be it further enacted, that the commissioners above
    named, shall have concurrent jurisdiction with the judges of the
    circuit and district courts of the United States, in their
    respective circuits and districts within the several States, and
    the judges of the superior courts of the Territories severally
    and collectively, in term time and vacation; and shall grant
    certificates to such claimants, upon satisfactory proof being
    made, with authority to take and remove such fugitives from
    service or labor, under the restrictions herein contained, to
    the State or territory from which such persons may have escaped
    or fled.

    SEC. 5. And be it further enacted: That it shall be the duty of
    all marshals and deputy marshals, to obey and execute all
    warrants and precepts issued under the provisions of this act,
    when to them directed; and should any marshal or deputy marshal
    refuse to receive such warrant or other process when tendered,
    or to use all proper means diligently to execute the same, he
    shall, on conviction thereof, be fined in the sum of one
    thousand dollars to the use of such claimant, on the motion of
    such claimant by the circuit or district court for the district
    of such marshal; and after arrest of such fugitive by the
    marshal, or his deputy, or whilst at any time in his custody,
    under the provisions of this act, should such fugitive escape,
    whether with or without the assent of such marshal or his
    deputy, such marshal shall be liable, on his official bond, to
    be prosecuted, for the benefit of such claimant, for the full
    value of the service or labor of said fugitive in the State,
    Territory or district whence he escaped; and the better to
    enable the said commissioners, when thus appointed, to execute
    their duties faithfully and efficiently, in conformity with the
    requirements of the Constitution of the United States, and of
    this act, they are hereby authorized and empowered, within their
    counties respectively, to appoint in writing under their hands,
    any one or more suitable persons, from time to time, to execute
    all such warrants and other process as may be issued by them in
    the lawful performance of their respective duties, with an
    authority to such commissioners, or the persons to be appointed
    by them, to execute process as aforesaid, to summon and call to
    their aid the bystanders or posse comitatus, of the proper
    county, when necessary to insure a faithful observance of the
    clause of the Constitution referred to, in conformity with the
    provisions of this act; and all good citizens are hereby
    commanded to aid and assist in the prompt and efficient
    execution of this law, whenever their services may be required,
    as aforesaid, for that purpose; and said warrants shall run and
    be executed by said officers anywhere in the State within which
    they are issued.

    SEC. 6. And be it further enacted, That when a person held to
    service or labor in any State or Territory of the United States,
    has heretofore, or shall hereafter escape into another State or
    Territory of the United States, the person or persons to whom
    such service or labor may be due, or his, her or their agent or
    attorney, duly authorized, by power of attorney, in writing,
    acknowledged and certified under the seal of some legal office
    or court of the State or Territory, in which the same may be
    executed, may pursue and reclaim such fugitive person, either by
    procuring a warrant from some one of the courts, judges, or
    commissioners aforesaid, of the proper circuit, district or
    county, for the apprehension of such fugitive from service or
    labor, or by seizing and arresting such fugitive, where the same
    can be done without process, and by taking, or causing such
    person to be taken, forthwith, before such court, judge or
    commissioner, whose duty it shall be to hear and determine the
    case of such claimant in a summary manner, and upon satisfactory
    proof being made, by deposition or affidavit, in writing, to be
    taken and certified by such court, judge or commissioner, or by
    other satisfactory testimony, duly taken and certified by some
    court, magistrate, justice of the peace, or other legal officer
    authorized to administer an oath and take depositions under the
    laws of the State or Territory from which such person owing
    service or labor may have escaped, with a certificate of such
    magistrate, or other authority, as aforesaid, with the seal of
    the proper court or officer thereto attached, which seal shall
    be sufficient to establish the competency of the proof, and with
    proof also, by affidavit, of the identity of the person whose
    service or labor is claimed to be due, as aforesaid, that the
    person so arrested does in fact owe service or labor to the
    person or persons claiming him or her, in the State or Territory
    from which such fugitive may have escaped, as aforesaid, and
    that said person escaped, to make out and deliver to such
    claimant, his or her agent or attorney, a certificate setting
    forth the substantial facts as to the service or labor due from
    such fugitive to the claimant, and of his or her escape from the
    State or Territory in which such service or labor was due, to
    the State or Territory, in which he or she was arrested, with
    authority to such claimant, or his or her agent or attorney, to
    use such reasonable force and restraint as may be necessary,
    under the circumstances of the case, to take and remove such
    fugitive person back to the State or Territory from whence he or
    she may have escaped, as aforesaid. In no trial or hearing,
    under this act, shall the testimony of such alleged fugitives be
    admitted in evidence, and the certificates in this and the first
    section mentioned, shall be conclusive of the right of the
    person or persons in whose favor granted to remove such
    fugitives to the State or Territory from which they escaped, and
    shall prevent all molestation of said person or persons by any
    process issued by any court, judge, magistrate, or other person
    whomsoever.

    SEC. 7. And be it further enacted, That any person who shall
    knowingly and willfully obstruct, hinder, or prevent such
    claimant, his agent, or attorney, or any person or persons
    lawfully assisting him, her or them from arresting such a
    fugitive from service or labor, either with or without process,
    as aforesaid, or shall rescue, or attempt to rescue, such
    fugitive from service or labor, or from the custody of such
    claimant, his or her agent, or attorney, or other person or
    persons lawfully assisting, as aforesaid, when so arrested,
    pursuant to the authority herein given and declared, or shall
    aid, abet, or assist such person, so owing service or labor, as
    aforesaid, directly or indirectly, to escape from such claimant,
    his agent or attorney, or other person or persons legally
    authorized, as aforesaid, or shall harbor or conceal such
    fugitive, so as to prevent the discovery and arrest of such
    person, after notice or knowledge of the fact that such person
    was a fugitive from service or labor, as aforesaid, shall, for
    either of said offences, be subject to a fine not exceeding one
    thousand dollars, and imprisonment not exceeding six months, by
    indictment and conviction before the District Court of the
    United States, for the district in which such offence may have
    been committed, or before the proper court of criminal
    jurisdiction, if committed within any one of the organized
    Territories of the United States; and shall, moreover, forfeit
    and pay, by way of civil damages, to the party injured by such
    illegal conduct, the sum of one thousand dollars for each
    fugitive so lost, as aforesaid, to be recovered by action of
    debt in any of the District or Territorial Courts aforesaid,
    within whose jurisdiction the said offence may have been
    committed.

    SEC. 8. And be it further enacted, That the Marshals, their
    deputies, and the clerks of the said districts and territorial
    courts, shall be paid for their services the like fees as may be
    allowed to them for similar services in other cases; and where
    such services are rendered exclusively in the arrest, custody,
    and delivery of the fugitives to the claimant, his or her agent,
    or attorney, or where such supposed fugitive may be discharged
    out of custody from the want of sufficient proof, as aforesaid,
    then such fees are to be paid in the whole by such complainant,
    his agent or attorney, and in all cases where the proceedings
    are before a Commissioner, he shall be entitled to a fee of ten
    dollars in full for his services in each case, upon the delivery
    of the said certificate to the claimant, his or her agent or
    attorney; or a fee of five dollars in cases where proof shall
    not, in the opinion of said Commissioner, warrant such
    certificate and delivery, inclusive of all services incident to
    such arrest and examination, to be paid in either case, by the
    claimant, his or her agent or attorney. The person or persons
    authorized to execute the process to be issued by such
    Commissioners for the arrest and detention of fugitives from
    service or labor, as aforesaid, shall also be entitled to a fee
    of five dollars each for each person he or they may arrest and
    take before any such Commissioners, as aforesaid, at the
    instance and request of such claimant, with such other fees as
    may be deemed reasonable by such Commissioner for such other
    additional services as may be necessarily performed by him or
    them; such as attending to the examination, keeping the fugitive
    in custody, and providing him with food and lodgings during his
    detention, and until the final determination of such
    Commissioner; and in general for performing such other duties as
    may be required by such claimant, his or her attorney or agent
    or commissioner in the premises; such fees to be made up in
    conformity with the fees usually charged by the officers of the
    courts of justice within the proper district or county as far as
    may be practicable, and paid by such claimants, their agents or
    attorneys, whether such supposed fugitive from service or labor
    be ordered to be delivered to such claimants by the final
    determination of such Commissioners or not.

    SEC. 9. And be it further enacted, That upon affidavit made by
    the claimant of such fugitive, his agent or attorney, after such
    certificate has been issued, that he has reason to apprehend
    that such fugitive will be rescued by force from his or their
    possession before he can be taken beyond the limits of the State
    in which the arrest is made, it shall be the duty of the officer
    making the arrest to retain such fugitive in his custody, and to
    remove him to the State whence he fled, and there to deliver him
    to said claimant, his agent or attorney. And to this end the
    officer aforesaid is hereby authorized and required to employ so
    many persons as he may deem necessary, to overcome such force,
    and to retain them in his service so long as circumstances may
    require; the said officer and his assistants, while so employed,
    to receive the same compensation, and to be allowed the same
    expenses as are now allowed by law for the transportation of
    criminals, to be certified by the judge of the district within
    which the arrest is made, and paid out of the treasury of the
    United States.

    SEC. 10. And be it further enacted, That when any person held to
    service or labor in any State or Territory, or in the District
    of Columbia, shall escape therefrom, the party to whom such
    service or labor shall be due, his, her, or their agent, or
    attorney may apply to any court of record therein, or judge
    thereof in vacation, and make such satisfactory proof to such
    court or judge in vacation, of the escape aforesaid, and that
    the person escaping owed service or labor to such party.
    Thereupon the court shall cause a record to be made of the
    matters so proved, and also a personal description of the person
    so escaping, with such convenient certainty as may be; and a
    transcript of such record, authenticated by the attestation of
    the clerk, and of the seal of said court being produced in any
    other State, Territory or District in which the person so
    escaping may be found, and being exhibited to any judge,
    commissioner, or other officer authorized by the law of the
    United States to cause persons escaping from, service or labor
    to be delivered up, shall be held and taken to be full and
    conclusive evidence of the fact of escape, and that the service
    or labor of the person escaping is due to the party in such
    record mentioned. And upon the production, by the said party, of
    other and further evidence, if necessary, either oral or by
    affidavit, in addition to what is contained in said record of
    the identity of the person escaping, he or she shall be
    delivered up to the claimant. And said court, commissioners,
    judge, or other persons authorized by this act to grant
    certificates to claimants of fugitives, shall, upon the
    production of the record and other evidence aforesaid, grant to
    such claimant a certificate of his right to take any such
    person, identified and proved to be owing service or labor as
    aforesaid, which certificate shall authorize such claimant to
    seize, or arrest, and transport such person to the State or
    Territory from which he escaped: Provided, That nothing herein
    contained shall be construed as requiring the production of a
    transcript of such record as evidence as aforesaid, but in its
    absence, the claim shall be heard and determined upon other
    satisfactory proofs competent in law.

THE SLAVE-HUNTING TRAGEDY IN LANCASTER COUNTY, IN SEPTEMBER, 1851.


"TREASON AT CHRISTIANA."


Having inserted the Fugitive Slave Bill in these records of the
Underground Rail Road, one or two slave cases will doubtless suffice to
illustrate the effect of its passage on the public mind, and the colored
people in particular. The deepest feelings of loathing, contempt and
opposition were manifested by the opponents of Slavery on every hand.
Anti-slavery papers, lecturers, preachers, etc., arrayed themselves
boldly against it on the ground of its inhumanity and violation of the
laws of God.

On the other hand, the slave-holders South, and their pro-slavery
adherents in the North demanded the most abject obedience from all
parties, regardless of conscience or obligation to God. In order to
compel such obedience, as well as to prove the practicability of the
law, unbounded zeal daily marked the attempt on the part of
slave-holders and slave-catchers to refasten the fetters on the limbs of
fugitives in different parts of the North, whither they had escaped.

In this dark hour, when colored men's rights were so insecure, as a
matter of self-defence, they felt called upon to arm themselves and
resist all kidnapping intruders, although clothed with the authority of
wicked law. Among the most exciting cases tending to justify this
course, the following may be named:

James Hamlet was the first slave case who was summarily arrested under
the Fugitive Slave Law, and sent back to bondage from New York.

William and Ellen Craft were hotly pursued to Boston by hunters from
Georgia.

Adam Gibson, a free colored man, residing in Philadelphia, was arrested,
delivered into the hands of his alleged claimants, by commissioner
Edward D. Ingraham, and hurried into Slavery.

Euphemia Williams (the mother of six living children),--her case excited
much interest and sympathy.

Shadrach was arrested and rescued in Boston.

Hannah Dellum and her child were returned to Slavery from Philadelphia.

Thomas Hall and his wife were pounced upon at midnight in Chester
county, beaten and dragged off to Slavery, etc.

And, as if gloating over their repeated successes, and utterly
regardless of all caution, about one year after the passage of this
nefarious bill, a party of slave-hunters arranged for a grand capture at
Christiana.

One year from the passage of the law, at a time when alarm and
excitement were running high, the most decided stand was taken at
Christiana, in the State of Pennsylvania, to defeat the law, and defend
freedom. Fortunately for the fugitives the plans of the slave-hunters
and officials leaked out while arrangements were making in Philadelphia
for the capture, and, information being sent to the Anti-slavery office,
a messenger was at once dispatched to Christiana to put all persons
supposed to be in danger on their guard.

Among those thus notified, were brave hearts, who did not believe in
running away from slave-catchers. They resolved to stand up for the
right of self-defence. They loved liberty and hated Slavery, and when
the slave-catchers arrived, they were prepared for them. Of the contest,
on that bloody morning, we have copied a report, carefully written at
the time, by C.M. Burleigh, editor of the "Pennsylvania Freeman," who
visited the scene of battle, immediately after it was over, and
doubtless obtained as faithful an account of all the facts in the case,
as could then be had.


    "Last Thursday morning, (the 11th inst,), a peaceful
    neighborhood in the borders of Lancaster county, was made the
    scene of a bloody battle, resulting from an attempt to capture
    seven colored men as fugitive slaves. As the reports of the
    affray which came to us were contradictory, and having good
    reason to believe that those of the daily press were grossly
    one-sided and unfair, we repaired to the scene of the tragedy,
    and, by patient inquiry and careful examination, endeavored to
    learn the real facts. To do this, from the varying and
    conflicting statements which we encountered, scarcely two of
    which agreed in every point, was not easy; but we believe the
    account we give below, as the result of these inquiries, is
    substantially correct.

    Very early on the 11th inst. a party of slave-hunters went into
    a neighborhood about two miles west of Christiana, near the
    eastern border of Lancaster county, in pursuit of fugitive
    slaves. The party consisted of Edward Gorsuch, his son,
    Dickerson Gorsuch, his nephew, Dr. Pearce, Nicholas Hutchins,
    and others, all from Baltimore county, Md., and one Henry H.
    Kline, a notorious slave-catching constable from Philadelphia,
    who had been deputized by Commissioner Ingraham for this
    business. At about day-dawn they were discovered lying in an
    ambush near the house of one William Parker, a colored man, by
    an inmate of the house, who had started for his work. He fled
    back to the house, pursued by the slave-hunters, who entered the
    lower part of the house, but were unable to force their way into
    the upper part, to which the family had retired. A horn was
    blown from an upper window; two shots were fired, both, as we
    believe, though we are not certain, by the assailants, one at
    the colored man who fled into the house, and the other at the
    inmates, through the window. No one was wounded by either. A
    parley ensued. The slave-holder demanded his slaves, who he said
    were concealed in the house. The colored men presented
    themselves successively at the window, and asked if they were
    the slaves claimed; Gorsuch said, that neither of them was his
    slave. They told him that they were the only colored men in the
    house, and were determined never to be taken alive as slaves.
    Soon the colored people of the neighborhood, alarmed by the
    horn, began to gather, armed with guns, axes, corn-cutters, or
    clubs. Mutual threatenings were uttered by the two parties. The
    slave-holders told the blacks that resistance would be useless,
    as they had a party of thirty men in the woods near by. The
    blacks warned them again to leave, as they would die before they
    would go into Slavery.

    From an hour to an hour and a half passed in these parleyings,
    angry conversations, and threats; the blacks increasing by new
    arrivals, until they probably numbered from thirty to fifty,
    most of them armed in some way. About this time, Castner
    Hanaway, a white man, and a Friend, who resided in the
    neighborhood, rode up, and was soon followed by Elijah Lewis,
    another Friend, a merchant, in Cooperville, both gentlemen
    highly esteemed as worthy and peaceable citizens. As they came
    up, Kline, the deputy marshal, ordered them to aid him, as a
    United States officer, to capture the fugitive slaves. They
    refused of course, as would any man not utterly destitute of
    honor, humanity, and moral principle, and warned the assailants
    that it was madness for them to attempt to capture fugitive
    slaves there, or even to remain, and begged them if they wished
    to save their own lives, to leave the ground. Kline replied, "Do
    you really think so?" "Yes," was the answer, "the sooner you
    leave, the better, if you would prevent bloodshed." Kline then
    left the ground, retiring into a very safe distance into a
    cornfield, and toward the woods. The blacks were so exasperated
    by his threats, that, but for the interposition of the two white
    Friends, it is very doubtful whether he would have escaped
    without injury. Messrs. Hanaway and Lewis both exerted their
    influence to dissuade the colored people from violence, and
    would probably have succeeded in restraining them, had not the
    assailing party fired upon them. Young Gorsuch asked his father
    to leave, but the old man refused, declaring, as it is said and
    believed, that he would "go to hell, or have his slaves."

    Finding they could do nothing further, Hanaway and Lewis both
    started to leave, again counselling the slave-hunters to go
    away, and the colored people to peace, but had gone but a few
    rods, when one of the inmates of the house attempted to come out
    at the door. Gorsuch presented his revolver, ordering him back.
    The colored man replied, "You had better go away, if you don't
    want to get hurt," and at the same time pushed him aside and
    passed out. Maddened at this, and stimulated by the question of
    his nephew, whether he would "take such an insult from a d----d
    nigger," Gorsuch fired at the colored man, and was followed by
    his son and nephew, who both fired their revolvers. The fire was
    returned by the blacks, who made a rush upon them at the same
    time. Gorsuch and his son fell, the one dead the other wounded.
    The rest of the party after firing their revolvers, fled
    precipitately through the corn and to the woods, pursued by some
    of the blacks. One was wounded, the rest escaped unhurt. Kline,
    the deputy marshal, who now boasts of his miraculous escape from
    a volley of musket-balls, had kept at a safe distance, though
    urged by young Gorsuch to stand by his father and protect him,
    when he refused to leave the ground. He of course came off
    unscathed. Several colored men were wounded, but none severely.
    Some had their hats or their clothes perforated with bullets;
    others had flesh wounds. They said that the Lord protected them,
    and they shook the bullets from their clothes. One man found
    several shot in his boot, which seemed to have spent their force
    before reaching him, and did not even break the skin. The
    slave-holders having fled, several neighbors, mostly Friends and
    anti-slavery men, gathered to succor the wounded and take charge
    of the dead. We are told that Parker himself protected the
    wounded man from his excited comrades, and brought water and a
    bed from his own house for the invalid, thus showing that he was
    as magnanimous to his fallen enemy as he was brave in the
    defence of his own liberty. The young man was then removed to a
    neighboring house, where the family received him with the
    tenderest kindness and paid him every attention, though they
    told him in Quaker phrase, that "they had no unity with his
    cruel business," and were very sorry to see him engaged in it.
    He was much affected by their kindness, and we are told,
    expressed his regret that he had been thus engaged, and his
    determination, if his life was spared, never again to make a
    similar attempt. His wounds are very severe, and it is feared
    mortal. All attempts to procure assistance to capture the
    fugitive slaves failed, the people in the neighborhood either
    not relishing the business of slave-catching, or at least, not
    choosing to risk their lives in it. There was a very great
    reluctance felt to going even to remove the body and the wounded
    man, until several abolitionists and Friends had collected for
    that object, when others found courage to follow on. The
    excitement caused by this most melancholy affair is very great
    among all classes. The abolitionists, of course, mourn the
    occurrence, while they see in it a legitimate fruit of the
    Fugitive Slave Law, just such a harvest of blood as they had
    long feared that the law would produce, and which they had
    earnestly labored to prevent. We believe that they alone, of all
    classes of the nation, are free from responsibility for its
    occurrence, having wisely foreseen the danger, and faithfully
    labored to avert it by removing its causes, and preventing the
    inhuman policy which has hurried on the bloody convulsion.

    The enemies of the colored people, are making this the occasion
    of fresh injuries, and a more bitter ferocity toward that
    defenceless people, and of new misrepresentation and calumnies
    against the abolitionists.

    The colored people, though the great body of them had no
    connection with this affair, are hunted like partridges upon the
    mountains, by the relentless horde which has been poured forth
    upon them, under the pretense of arresting the parties concerned
    in the fight. When we reached Christiana, on Friday afternoon,
    we found that the Deputy-Attorney Thompson, of Lancaster, was
    there, and had issued warrants, upon the depositions of Kline
    and others, for the arrest of all suspected persons. A company
    of police were scouring the neighborhood in search of colored
    people, several of whom were seized while at their work near by,
    and brought in.

    CAstner Hanaway and Elijah Lewis, hearing that warrants were
    issued against them, came to Christiana, and voluntarily gave
    themselves up, calm and strong in the confidence of their
    innocence. They, together with the arrested colored men, were
    sent to Lancaster jail that night.

    The next morning we visited the ground of the battle, and the
    family where young Gorsuch now lives, and while there, we saw a
    deposition which he had just made, that he believed no white
    persons were engaged in the affray, beside his own party. As he
    was on the ground during the whole controversy, and deputy
    Marshall Kline had discreetly run off into the corn-field,
    before the fighting began, the hireling slave-catcher's eager
    and confident testimony against our white friends, will, we
    think, weigh lightly with impartial men.

    On returning to Christiana, we found that the United States
    Marshal from the city, had arrived at that place, accompanied by
    Commissioner Ingraham, Mr. Jones, a special commissioner of the
    United States, from Washington, the U.S. District Attorney
    Ashmead, with forty-five U.S. Marines from the Navy Yard, and a
    posse of about forty of the City Marshal's police, together with
    a large body of special constables, eager for such a manhunt,
    from Columbia and Lancaster and other places. This crowd divided
    into parties, of from ten to twenty-five, and scoured the
    country, in every direction, for miles around, ransacking the
    houses of the colored people, and captured every colored man
    they could find, with several colored women, and two other white
    men. Never did our heart bleed with deeper pity for the peeled
    and persecuted colored people, than when we saw this troop let
    loose upon them, and witnessed the terror and distress which its
    approach excited in families, wholly innocent of the charges
    laid against them."


On the other hand, a few extracts from the editorials of some of the
leading papers, will suffice to show the state of public feeling at that
time, and the dreadful opposition abolitionists and fugitives had to
contend with.

From one of the leading daily journals of Philadelphia, we copy as
follows:


    "There can be no difference of opinion concerning the shocking
    affair which occurred at Christiana, on Thursday, the resisting
    of a law of Congress by a band of armed negroes, whereby the
    majesty of the Government was defied and life taken in one and
    the same act. There is something more than a mere ordinary,
    something more than even a murderous, riot in all this. It is an
    act of insurrection, we might, considering the peculiar class
    and condition of the guilty parties, almost call it a servile
    insurrection--if not also one of treason. Fifty, eighty, or a
    hundred persons, whether white or black, who are deliberately in
    arms for the purpose of resisting the law, even the law for the
    recovery of fugitive slaves, are in the attitude of levying war
    against the United States; and doubly heavy becomes the crime of
    murder in such a case, and doubly serious the accountability of
    all who have any connection with the act as advisers,
    suggesters, countenancers, or accessories in any way whatever."


In those days, the paper from which this extract is taken, represented
the Whig party and the more moderate and respectable class of citizens.

The following is an extract from a leading democratic organ of
Philadelphia:


    "We will not, however, insult the reader by arguing that which
    has not been heretofore doubted, and which is not doubted now,
    by ten honest men in the State, and that is that the
    abolitionists are implicated in the Christiana murder. All the
    ascertained facts go to show that they were the real, if not the
    chief instigators. White men are known to harbor fugitives, in
    the neighborhood of Christiana, and these white men are known to
    be abolitionists, known to be opposed to the Fugitive Slave Law,
    and _known_ to be the warm friends of William F. Johnston,
    (Governor of the State of Pennsylvania). And, as if to clinch
    the argument, no less than three white men are now in the
    Lancaster prison, and were arrested as accomplices in the
    dreadful affair on the morning of the eleventh. And one of these
    white men was committed on a charge of high treason, on Saturday
    last, by United States Commissioner Ingraham."


Another daily paper of opposite politics thus spake:


    "The unwarrantable outrage committed last week, at Christiana,
    Lancaster county, is a foul stain upon the fair name and fame of
    our State. We are pleased to see that the officers of the
    Federal and State Governments are upon the tracks of those who
    were engaged in the riot, and that several arrests have been
    made.

    We do not wish to see the poor misled blacks who participated in
    the affair, suffer to any great extent, for they were but tools.
    The men who are really chargeable with treason against the
    United States Government, and with the death of Mr. Gorsuch, an
    estimable citizen of Maryland, are unquestionably _white_, with
    hearts black enough to incite them to the commission of any
    crime equal in atrocity to that committed in Lancaster county.
    Pennsylvania has now but one course to pursue, and that is to
    aid, and warmly aid, the United States in bringing to condign
    punishment, every man engaged in the riot. She owes it to
    herself and to the Union. Let her in this resolve, be just and
    fearless."


From a leading neutral daily paper the following is taken: "One would
suppose from the advice of forcible resistance, so familiarly given by
the abolitionists, that they are quite unaware that there is any such
crime as treason recognized by the Constitution, or punished with death
by the laws of the United States. We would remind them, that not only is
there such a crime, but that there is a solemn decision of the Supreme
Court, that all who are concerned in a conspiracy which ripens into
treason, whether present or absent from the scene of actual violence,
are involved in the same liabilities as the immediate actors. If they
engage in the conspiracy and stimulate the treason, they may keep their
bodies from the affray without saving their necks from a halter.

It would be very much to the advantage of society, if an example could
be made of some of these persistent agitators, who excite the ignorant
and reckless to treasonable violence, from which they themselves shrink,
but who are, not only in morals, but in law, equally guilty and equally
amenable to punishment with the victims of their inflammatory counsels."

A number of the most influential citizens represented the occurrence to
the Governor as follows:


    "To the Governor of Pennsylvania:

    The undersigned, citizens of Pennsylvania, respectfully
    represent:

    That citizens of a neighboring State have been cruelly
    assassinated by a band of armed outlaws at a place not more than
    three hours' journey distant from the seat of Government and
    from the commercial metropolis of the State:

    That this insurrectionary movement in one of the most populous
    parts of the State has been so far successful as to overawe the
    local ministers of justice and paralyze the power of the law:

    That your memorialists are not aware that 'any military force'
    has been sent to the seat of insurrection, or that the civil
    authority has been strengthened by the adoption of any measures
    suited to the momentous crisis.

    They, therefore, respectfully request the chief executive
    magistrate of Pennsylvania to take into consideration the
    necessity of vindicating the outraged laws, and sustaining the
    dignity of the Commonwealth on this important and melancholy
    occasion."


Under this high pressure of public excitement, threatening and alarm
breathed so freely on every hand, that fugitive slaves and their friends
in this region of Pennsylvania at least, were compelled to pass through
an hour of dreadful darkness--an ordeal extremely trying. The
authorities of the United States, as well as the authorities of the
State of Pennsylvania and Maryland, were diligently making arrests
wherever a suspected party could be found, who happened to belong in the
neighborhood of Christiana.

In a very short time the following persons were in custody: J. Castner
Hanaway, Elijah Lewis, Joseph Scarlett, Samuel Kendig, Henry Spins,
George Williams, Charles Hunter, Wilson Jones, Francis Harkins, Benjamin
Thomson, William Brown (No. 1), William Brown (No. 2), John Halliday,
Elizabeth Mosey, John Morgan, Joseph Berry, John Norton, Denis Smith,
Harvey Scott, Susan Clark, Tansy Brown, Eliza Brown, Eliza Parker,
Hannah Pinckney, Robert Johnson, Miller Thompson, Isaiah Clark, and
Jonathan Black.

These were not all, but sufficed for a beginning; at least it made an
interesting entertainment for the first day's examination; and although
there were two or three non-resistant Quakers, and a number of poor
defenceless colored women among those thus taken as prisoners, still it
seemed utterly impossible for the exasperated defenders of Slavery to
divest themselves of the idea, that this heroic deed, in self-defence,
on the part of men who felt that their liberties were in danger, was
anything less than actually levying war against the United States.

Accordingly, therefore, the hearing gravely took place at Lancaster. On
the side of the Commonwealth, the following distinguished counsel
appeared on examination: Hon. John L. Thompson, District Attorney; Wm.
B. Faulney, Esq.; Thos. E. Franklin, Esq., Attorney-General of Lancaster
county; George L. Ashmead, Esq., of Philadelphia, representative of the
United States authorities; and Hon. Robert Brent, Attorney-General of
Maryland.

For the defence--Hon. Thaddeus Stevens, Reah Frazer, Messrs. Ford,
Cline, and Dickey, Esquires.

From a report of the first day's hearing we copy a short extract, as
follows:


    "The excitement at Christiana, during yesterday, was very great.
    Several hundred persons were present, and the deepest feeling
    was manifested against the perpetrators of the outrage. At two
    o'clock yesterday afternoon, the United States Marshal, Mr.
    Roberts, United States District Attorney, J.H. Ashmead, Esq.,
    Mr. Commissioner Ingraham, and Recorder Lee, accompanied by the
    United States Marines, returned to the city. Lieut. Johnson, and
    officers Lewis S. Brest, Samuel Mitchell, Charles McCully,
    Samuel Neff, Jacob Albright, Robert McEwen, and ---- Perkenpine,
    by direction of the United States Marshal, had charge of the
    following named prisoners, who were safely lodged in Moyamensing
    prison, accompanied by the Marines:--Joseph Scarlett, (white),
    William Brown, Ezekiel Thompson, Isaiah Clarkson, Daniel
    Caulsberry, Benjamin Pendergrass, Elijah Clark, George W.H.
    Scott, Miller Thompson, and Samuel Hanson, all colored. The last
    three were placed in the debtors' apartment, and the others in
    the criminal apartment of the Moyamensing prison to await their
    trial for treason, &c."


In alluding to the second day's doings, the Philadelphia Ledger thus
represented matters at the field of battle:


    "The intelligence received last evening, represents the country
    for miles around, to be in as much excitement as at any time
    since the horrible deed was committed. The officers sent there
    at the instance of the proper authorities are making diligent
    search in every direction, and securing every person against
    whom the least suspicion is attached. The police force from this
    city, amounting to about sixty men, are under the marshalship of
    Lieut. Ellis. Just as the cars started east, in the afternoon,
    five more prisoners who were secured at a place called the Welsh
    Mountains, twelve miles distant, were brought into Christiana.
    They were placed in custody until such time as a hearing will
    take place."


Although the government had summoned its ablest legal talent and the
popular sentiment was as a hundred to one against William Parker and his
brave comrades who had made the slave-hunter "bite the dust," most nobly
did Thaddeus Stevens prove that he was not to be cowed, that he believed
in the stirring sentiment so much applauded by the American people,
"Give me liberty, or give me death," not only for the white man but for
all men. Thus standing upon such great and invulnerable principles, it
was soon discovered that one could chase a thousand, and two put ten
thousand to flight in latter as well as in former times.

At first even the friends of freedom thought that the killing of Gorsuch
was not only wrong, but unfortunate for the cause. Scarcely a week
passed, however, before the matter was looked upon in a far different
light, and it was pretty generally thought that, if the Lord had not a
direct hand in it, the cause of Freedom at least would be greatly
benefited thereby.

And just in proportion as the masses cried, Treason! Treason! the hosts
of freedom from one end of the land to the other were awakened to
sympathize with the slave. Thousands were soon aroused to show sympathy
who had hitherto been dormant. Hundreds visited the prisoners in their
cells to greet, cheer, and offer them aid and counsel in their hour of
sore trial.

The friends of freedom remained calm even while the pro-slavery party
were fiercely raging and gloating over the prospect, as they evidently
thought of the satisfaction to be derived from teaching the
abolitionists a lesson from the scaffold, which would in future prevent
Underground Rail Road passengers from killing their masters when in
pursuit of them.

Through the efforts of the authorities three white men, and twenty-seven
colored had been safely lodged in Moyamensing prison, under the charge
of treason. The authorities, however, had utterly failed to catch the
hero, William Parker, as he had been sent to Canada, _viâ_ the
Underground Rail Road, and was thus "sitting under his own vine and fig
tree, where none dared to molest, or make him afraid."

As an act of simple justice it may here be stated that the abolitionists
and prisoners found a true friend and ally at least in one United States
official, who, by the way, figured prominently in making arrests, etc.,
namely: the United States Marshal, A.E. Roberts. In all his intercourse
with the prisoners and their friends, he plainly showed that all his
sympathies were on the side of Freedom, and not with the popular
pro-slavery sentiment which clamored so loudly against traitors and
abolitionists.

Two of his prisoners had been identified in the jail as fugitive slaves
by their owners. When the trial came on these two individuals were among
the missing. How they escaped was unknown; the Marshal, however, was
strongly suspected of being a friend of the Underground Rail Road, and
to add now, that those suspicions were founded on fact, will, doubtless,
do him no damage.

In order to draw the contrast between Freedom and Slavery, simply with a
view of showing how the powers that were acted and judged in the days of
the reign of the Fugitive Slave Law, unquestionably nothing better could
be found to meet the requirements of this issue than the charge of Judge
Kane, coupled with the indictment of the Grand Jury. In the light of the
Emancipation and the Fifteenth Amendment, they are too transparent to
need a single word of comment. Judge and jury having found the accused
chargeable with Treason, nothing remained, so far as the men were
concerned, but to bide their time as best they could in prison. Most of
them were married, and had wives and children clinging to them in this
hour of fearful looking for of judgment.



THE LAW OF TREASON, AS LAID DOWN BY JUDGE KANE.


The following charge to the Grand Jury of the United States District
Court, in reference to the Slave-hunting affray in Lancaster county, and
preparatory to their finding bills of indictment against the prisoners,
was delivered on Monday, September 28, by Judge Kane:


    "Gentlemen of the Grand Jury:--It has been represented to me,
    that since we met last, circumstances have occurred in one of
    the neighboring counties in our District, which should call for
    your prompt scrutiny, and perhaps for the energetic action of
    the Court. It is said, that a citizen of the State of Maryland,
    who had come into Pennsylvania to reclaim a fugitive from labor,
    was forcibly obstructed in the attempt by a body of armed men,
    assaulted, beaten and murdered; that some members of his family,
    who had accompanied him in the pursuit, were at the same time,
    and by the same party maltreated and grievously wounded; and
    that an officer of justice, constituted under the authority of
    this Court, who sought to arrest the fugitive, was impeded and
    repelled by menaces and violence, while proclaiming his
    character, and exhibiting his warrant. It is said, too, that the
    time and manner of these outrages, their asserted object, the
    denunciations by which they were preceded, and the simultaneous
    action of most of the guilty parties, evinced a combined purpose
    forcibly to resist and make nugatory a constitutional provision,
    and the statutes enacted in pursuance of it: and it is added, in
    confirmation of this, that for some months back, gatherings of
    people, strangers, as well as citizens, have been held from time
    to time in the vicinity of the place of the recent outbreaks, at
    which exhortations were made and pledges interchanged to hold
    the law for the recovery of fugitive slaves as of no validity,
    and to defy its execution. Such are some of the representations
    that have been made in my hearing, and in regard to which, it
    has become your duty, as the Grand Inquest of the District, to
    make legal inquiry. Personally, I know nothing of the facts, or
    the evidence relating to them. As a member of the Court, before
    which the accused persons may hereafter be arraigned and tried,
    I have sought to keep my mind altogether free from any
    impressions of their guilt or innocence, and even from an
    extra-judicial knowledge of the circumstances which must
    determine the legal character of the offence that has thus been
    perpetrated. It is due to the great interests of public justice,
    no less than to the parties implicated in a criminal charge,
    that their cause should be in no wise and in no degree
    prejudged. And in referring, therefore, to the representations
    which have been made to me, I have no other object than to point
    you to the reasons for my addressing you at this advanced period
    of our sessions, and to enable you to apply with more facility
    and certainty the principles and rules of law, which I shall
    proceed to lay before you.

    If the circumstances, to which I have adverted, have in fact
    taken place, they involve the highest crime known to our laws.
    Treason against the United States is defined by the
    Constitution, Art. 3, Sec. 3, cl. 1, to consist in "levying war
    against them, or adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and
    comfort." This definition is borrowed from the ancient Law of
    England, Stat. 25, Edw. 3, Stat. 5, Chap. 2, and its terms must
    be understood, of course, in the sense which they bore in that
    law, and which obtained here when the Constitution was adopted.
    The expression, "levying war," so regarded, embraces not merely
    the act of formal or declared war, but any combination forcibly
    to prevent or oppose the execution or enforcement of a provision
    of the Constitution, or of a public Statute, if accompanied or
    followed by an act of forcible opposition in pursuance of such
    combination. This, in substance, has been the interpretation
    given to these words by the English Judges, and it has been
    uniformly and fully recognized and adopted in the Courts of the
    United States. (See Foster, Hale, and Hawkins, and the opinions
    of Iredell, Patterson, Chase, Marshall, and Washington, J.J., of
    the Supreme Court, and of Peters, D.J., in U.S. vs. Vijol, U.S.
    vs. Mitchell, U.S. vs. Fries, U.S. vs. Bollman and Swartwout,
    and U.S. vs. Burr).

    The definition, as you will observe, includes two particulars,
    both of them indispensable elements of the offence. There must
    have been a combination or conspiring together to oppose the law
    by force, and some actual force must have been exerted, or the
    crime of treason is not consummated. The highest, or at least
    the direct proof of the combination may be found in the declared
    purposes of the individual party before the actual outbreak; or
    it may be derived from the proceedings of meetings, in which he
    took part openly; or which he either prompted, or made effective
    by his countenance or sanction,--commending, counselling and
    instigating forcible resistance to the law. I speak, of course,
    of a conspiring to resist a law, not the more limited purpose to
    violate it, or to prevent its application and enforcement in a
    particular case, or against a particular individual. The
    combination must be directed against the law itself. But such
    direct proof of this element of the offence is not legally
    necessary to establish its existence. The concert of purpose may
    be deduced from the concerted action itself, or it may be
    inferred from facts occurring at the time, or afterwards, as
    well as before. Besides this, there must be some act of
    violence, as the result or consequence of the combining.

    But here again, it is not necessary to prove that the individual
    accused was a direct, personal actor in the violence. If he was
    present, directing, aiding, abetting, counselling, or
    countenancing it, he is in law guilty of the forcible act. Nor
    is even his personal presence indispensable. Though he be absent
    at the time of its actual perpetration, yet, if he directed the
    act, devised, or knowingly furnished the means for carrying it
    into effect, instigated others to perform it, he shares their
    guilt.

    In treason there are no accessories. There has been, I fear, an
    erroneous impression on this subject, among a portion of our
    people. If it has been thought safe, to counsel and instigate
    others to acts of forcible oppugnation to the provisions of a
    statute, to inflame the minds of the ignorant by appeals to
    passion, and denunciations of the law as oppressive, unjust,
    revolting to the conscience, and not binding on the actions of
    men, to represent the constitution of the land as a compact of
    iniquity, which it were meritorious to violate or subvert, the
    mistake has been a grievous one; and they who have fallen into
    it may rejoice, if peradventure their appeals and their counsels
    have been hitherto without effect. The supremacy of the
    constitution, in all its provisions, is at the very basis of our
    existence as a nation. He, whose conscience, or whose theories
    of political or individual right, forbid him to support and
    maintain it in its fullest integrity, may relieve himself from
    the duties of citizenship, by divesting himself of its rights.
    But while he remains within our borders, he is to remember, that
    successfully to instigate treason, is to commit it. I shall not
    be supposed to imply in these remarks, that I have doubts of the
    law-abiding character of our people. No one can know them well,
    without the most entire reliance on their fidelity to the
    constitution. Some of them may differ from the mass, as to the
    rightfulness or the wisdom of this or the other provision that
    is found in the federal compact, they may be divided in
    sentiment as to the policy of a particular statute, or of some
    provision in a statute; but it is their honest purpose to stand
    by the engagements, all the engagements, which bind them to
    their brethren of the other States. They have but one country;
    they recognize no law of higher social obligation than its
    constitution and the laws made in pursuance of it; they
    recognize no higher appeal than to the tribunals it has
    appointed; they cherish no patriotism that looks beyond the
    union of the States. That there are men here, as elsewhere, whom
    a misguided zeal impels to violations of law; that there are
    others who are controlled by false sympathies, and some who
    yield too readily and too fully to sympathies not always false,
    or if false, yet pardonable, and become criminal by yielding,
    that we have, not only in our jails and almshouses, but
    segregated here and there in detached portions of the State,
    ignorant men, many of them without political rights, degraded in
    social position, and instinctive of revolt, all this is true. It
    is proved by the daily record of our police courts, and by the
    ineffective labors of those good men among us, who seek to
    detach want from temptation, passion from violence, and
    ignorance from crime.

    But it should not be supposed that any of these represent the
    sentiment of Pennsylvania, and it would be to wrong our people
    sorely, to include them in the same category of personal,
    social, or political morals. It is declared in the article of
    the constitution, which I have already cited, that 'no person
    shall be convicted of treason, unless on the testimony of two
    witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open
    court.' This and the corresponding language in the act of
    Congress of the 30th of April, 1790, seem to refer to the proofs
    on the trial, and not to the preliminary hearing before the
    committing magistrate, or the proceeding before the grand
    inquest. There can be no conviction until after arraignment on
    bill found. The previous action in the case is not a trial, and
    cannot convict, whatever be the evidence or the number of
    witnesses. I understand this to have been the opinion
    entertained by Chief Justice Marshall, 1 Burr's Trial, 195, and
    though it differs from that expressed by Judge Iredell on the
    indictment of Fries, (1 Whart. Am. St. Tr. 480), I feel
    authorized to recommend it to you, as within the terms of the
    Constitution, and involving no injustice to the accused. I have
    only to add that treason against the United States, may be
    committed by any one resident or sojourning within its
    territory, and under the protection of its laws, whether he be a
    citizen or an alien. (Fost. C.L. 183, 5.--1 Hale 59, 60, 62. 1
    Hawk. ch. 17, § 5, Kel. 38).

    Besides the crime of treason, which I have thus noticed, there
    are offences of minor grades, against the Constitution and the
    State, some or other of which may be apparently established by
    the evidence that will come before you. These are embraced in
    the act of Congress, on the 30th of Sept., 1790, Ch. 9, Sec. 22,
    on the subject of obstructing or resisting the service of legal
    process,--the act of the 2d of March, 1831, Chap. 99, Sec. 2,
    which secures the jurors, witnesses, and officers of our Courts
    in the fearless, free, and impartial administration of their
    respective functions,--and the act of the 18th of September,
    1850, Ch. 60, which relates more particularly to the rescue, or
    attempted rescue of a fugitive from labor. These Acts were made
    the subject of a charge to the Grand Jury of this Court in
    November last, of which I shall direct a copy to be laid before
    you; and I do not deem it necessary to repeat their provisions
    at this time.

    Gentlemen of the Grand Jury: You are about to enter upon a most
    grave and momentous duty. You will be careful in performing it,
    not to permit your indignation against crime, or your just
    appreciation of its perilous consequences, to influence your
    judgment of the guilt of those who may be charged before you
    with its commission. But you will be careful, also, that no
    misguided charity shall persuade you to withhold the guilty from
    the retributions of justice. You will inquire whether an offence
    has been committed, what was its legal character, and who were
    the offenders,--and this done, and this only, you will make your
    presentments according to the evidence and the law. Your
    inquiries will not be restricted to the conduct of the people
    belonging to our own State. If in the progress of them, you
    shall find, that men have been among us, who, under whatever
    mask of conscience or of peace, have labored to incite others to
    treasonable violence, and who, after arranging the elements of
    the mischief, have withdrawn themselves to await the explosion
    they had contrived, you will feel yourselves bound to present
    the fact to the Court,--and however distant may be the place in
    which the offenders may have sought refuge, we give you the
    pledge of the law, that its far-reaching energies shall be
    exerted to bring them up for trial,--if guilty, to punishment.
    The offence of treason is not triable in this Court; but by an
    act of Congress, passed on the 8th of August, 1845, Chap. 98, it
    is made lawful for the Grand Jury, empanelled and sworn in the
    District Court, to take cognizance of all the indictments for
    crimes against the United States within the jurisdiction of
    either of the Federal Courts of the District. There being no
    Grand Jury in attendance at this time in the Circuit Court, to
    pass upon the accusations I have referred to in the first
    instance, it has fallen to my lot to assume the responsible
    office of expounding to you the law in regard to them. I have
    the satisfaction of knowing, that if the views I have expressed
    are in any respect erroneous, they must undergo the revision of
    my learned brother of the Supreme Court, who presides in this
    Circuit, before they can operate to the serious prejudice of any
    one; and that if they are doubtful even, provision exists for
    their re-examination in the highest tribunal of the country."


On the strength of Judge Kane's carefully-drawn up charge the Grand Jury
found true bills of indictment against forty of the Christiana
offenders, charged with treason. James Jackson, an aged member of the
Society of Friends (a Quaker), and a well-known non-resistant
abolitionist, was of this number. With his name the blanks were filled
up; the same form (with regard to these bills) was employed in the case
of each one of the accused. The following is a



COPY OF THE INDICTMENT.



    Eastern District of Pennsylvania, ss.:

    The Grand Inquest of the United States of America, inquiring for
    the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, on their oaths and
    affirmations, respectfully do present, that James Jackson,
    yeoman of the District aforesaid, owing allegiance to the United
    States of America, wickedly devising and intending the peace and
    tranquility of said United States, to disturb, and prevent the
    execution of the laws thereof within the same, to wit, a law of
    the United States, entitled "An act respecting fugitives from
    justice and persons escaping from the service of their masters,"
    approved February twelfth, one thousand seven hundred and
    ninety-three, and also a law of the United States, entitled "An
    act to amend, and supplementary to, the act entitled, An act
    respecting fugitives from justice and persons escaping from the
    service of their masters, approved February the twelfth, one
    thousand seven hundred and ninety-three," which latter
    supplementary act was approved September eighteenth, one
    thousand eight hundred and fifty, on the eleventh day of
    September, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred
    and fifty-one, in the county of Lancaster, in the State of
    Pennsylvania and District aforesaid, and within the jurisdiction
    of this Court, wickedly and traitorously did intend to levy war
    against the United States within the same. And to fulfill and
    bring to effect the said traitorous intention of him, the said
    James Jackson, he, the said James Jackson afterward, to wit, on
    the day and year aforesaid, in the State, District and County
    aforesaid, and within the jurisdiction of this Court, with a
    great multitude of persons, whose names, to this Inquest are as
    yet unknown, to a great number, to wit, to the number of one
    hundred persons and upwards, armed and arrayed in a warlike
    manner, that is to say, with guns, swords, and other warlike
    weapons, as well offensive as defensive, being then and there
    unlawfully and traitorously assembled, did traitorously assemble
    and combine against the said United States, and then and there,
    with force and arms, wickedly and traitorously, and with the
    wicked and traitorous intention to oppose and prevent, by means
    of intimidation and violence, the execution of the said laws of
    the United States within the same, did array and dispose
    themselves in a warlike and hostile manner against the said
    United States, and then and there, with force and arms, in
    pursuance of such their traitorous intention, he, the said James
    Jackson, with the said persons so as aforesaid, wickedly and
    traitorously did levy war against the United States.

    And further, to fulfill and bring to effect the said traitorous
    intention of him, the said James Jackson, and in pursuance and
    in execution of the said wicked and traitorous combination to
    oppose, resist and prevent the said laws of the United States
    from being carried into execution, he, the said James Jackson,
    afterwards, to wit, on the day and year first aforesaid, in the
    State, District and county aforesaid, and within the
    jurisdiction aforesaid, with the said persons whose names to
    this Inquest are as yet unknown, did, wickedly and traitorously
    assemble against the said United States, with the avowed
    intention by force of arms and intimidation to prevent the
    execution of the said laws of the United States within the same;
    and in pursuance and execution of such their wicked and
    traitorous combination, he, the said James Jackson, then and
    there with force and arms, with the said persons to a great
    number, to wit, the number of one hundred persons and upwards,
    armed and arrayed in a warlike manner, that is to say, with
    guns, swords, and other warlike weapons, as well offensive as
    defensive, being then and there, unlawfully and traitorously
    assembled, did wickedly, knowingly, and traitorously resist and
    oppose one Henry H. Kline, an officer, duly appointed by Edward
    D. Ingraham, Esq., a commissioner, duly appointed by the Circuit
    Court of the United States, for the said district, in the
    execution of the duty of the office of the said Kline, he, the
    said Kline, being appointed by the said Edward Ingraham, Esq.,
    by writing under his hand, to execute warrants and other process
    issued by him, the said Ingraham, in the performance of his
    duties as Commissioner, under the said laws of the United
    States, and then and there, with force and arms, with the said
    great multitude of persons, so as, aforesaid, unlawfully and
    traitorously assembled, and armed and arrayed in manner as
    aforesaid, he, the said, James Jackson, wickedly and
    traitorously did oppose and resist, and prevent the said Kline,
    from executing the lawful process to him directed and delivered
    by the said commissioner against sundry persons, then residents
    of said county, who had been legally charged before the said
    commissioner as being persons held to service or labor in the
    State of Maryland, and owing such service or labor to a certain
    Edward Gorsuch, under the laws of the said State of Maryland,
    had escaped therefrom, into the said Eastern district of
    Pennsylvania; which process, duly issued by the said
    commissioner, the said Kline then and there had in his
    possession, and was then and there proceeding to execute, as by
    law he was bound to do; and so the grand inquest, upon their
    respective oaths and affirmations aforesaid, do say, that the
    said James Jackson, in manner aforesaid, as much as in him lay,
    wickedly and traitorously did prevent, by means of force and
    intimidation, the execution of the said laws of the United
    States, in the said State and District. And further, to fulfill
    and bring to effect, the said traitorous intention of him, the
    said James Jackson, and in further pursuance, and in the
    execution of the said wicked and traitorous combination to
    expose, resist, and prevent the execution of the said laws of
    the said United States, in the State and District aforesaid, he,
    the said James Jackson, afterwards, to wit, on the day and year
    first aforesaid, in the State, county, and district aforesaid,
    and within the jurisdiction of this court, with the said persons
    whose names to the grand inquest aforesaid, are as yet unknown,
    did, wickedly and traitorously assemble against the said United
    States with the avowed intention, by means of force and
    intimidation, to prevent the execution of the said laws of the
    United States in the State and district aforesaid, and in
    pursuance and execution of such, their wicked and traitorous
    combination and intention, then and there to the State,
    district, and county aforesaid, and within the jurisdiction of
    this court, with force and arms, with a great multitude of
    persons, to wit, the number of one hundred persons and upwards,
    armed and arrayed in a warlike manner, that is to say, with
    guns, swords, and other warlike weapons, as well offensive as
    defensive, being then and there unlawfully and traitorously
    assembled, he, the said James Jackson, did, knowingly, and
    unlawfully assault the said Henry H. Kline, he, the said Kline,
    being an officer appointed by writing, under the hand of the
    said Edward D. Ingraham, Esq., a commissioner under said laws,
    to execute warrants and other process, issued by the said
    commissioner in the performance of his duties as such; and he,
    the said James Jackson, did, then and there, traitorously, with
    force and arms, against the will of the said Kline, liberate and
    take out of his custody, persons by him before that time
    arrested, and in his lawful custody, then and there being, by
    virtue of lawful process against them issued by the said
    commissioner, they being legally charged with being persons held
    to service or labor in the State of Maryland, and owing such
    service or labor to a certain Edward Gorsuch, under the laws of
    the said State of Maryland, who had escaped therefrom into the
    said district; and so the grand inquest aforesaid, upon their
    oaths and affirmations, aforesaid, do say, that he, the said
    James Jackson, as much as in him lay, did, then and there, in
    pursuance and in execution of the said wicked and traitorous
    combination and intention, wickedly and traitorously, by means
    of force and intimidation, prevent the execution of the said
    laws of the United States, in the said State and district.

    And further to fulfill and bring to effect, the said traitorous
    intention of him, the said James Jackson, and in pursuance and
    in execution of the said wicked and traitorous combination to
    oppose, resist and prevent the said laws of the United States
    from being carried into execution, he, the said James Jackson,
    afterwards, to wit, on the day and year first aforesaid, and on
    divers other days, both before and afterwards in the State and
    district aforesaid, and within the jurisdiction of this court,
    with the said persons to this inquest as yet unknown,
    maliciously and traitorously did meet, conspire, consult, and
    agree among themselves, further to oppose, resist, and prevent,
    by means of force and intimidation, the execution of the said
    laws herein before specified.

    And further to fulfill, perfect, and bring to effect the said
    traitorous intention of him the said James Jackson, and in
    pursuance and execution of the said wicked and traitorous
    combination to oppose and resist the said laws of the United
    States from being carried into execution, in the State and
    district aforesaid, he, the said James Jackson, together with
    the other persons whose names are to this inquest as yet
    unknown, on the day and year first aforesaid, and on divers
    other days and times, as well before and after, at the district
    aforesaid, within the jurisdiction of said court, with force and
    arms, maliciously and traitorously did prepare and compose, and
    did then and there maliciously and traitorously cause and
    procure to be prepared and composed, divers books, pamphlets,
    letters, declarations, resolutions, addresses, papers and
    writings, and did then and there maliciously and traitorously
    publish and disperse and cause to be published and dispersed,
    divers other books and pamphlets, letters, declarations,
    resolutions, addresses, papers and writings; the said books,
    pamphlets, letters, declarations, resolutions, addresses, papers
    and writings, so respectively prepared, composed, published and
    dispersed, as last aforesaid, containing therein, amongst other
    things, incitements, encouragements, and exhortations, to move,
    induce and persuade persons held to service in any of the United
    States, by the laws thereof, who had escaped into the said
    district, as well as other persons, citizens of said district,
    to resist, oppose, and prevent, by violence and intimidation,
    the execution of the said laws, and also containing therein,
    instructions and directions how and upon what occasion, the
    traitorous purposes last aforesaid, should and might be carried
    into effect, contrary to the form of the act of Congress in such
    case made and provided, and against the peace and dignity of the
    United States.

    JOHN W. ASHMEAD,

    Attorney of the U.S. for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.


The abolitionists were leaving no stone unturned in order to
triumphantly meet the case in Court. During the interim many tokens of
kindness and marks of Christian benevolence were extended to the
prisoners by their friends and sympathizers; among these none deserve
more honorable mention than the noble act of Thomas L. Kane (son of
Judge Kane, and now General), in tendering all the prisoners a sumptuous
Thanksgiving dinner, consisting of turkey, etc., pound cake, etc., etc.
The dinner for the white prisoners, Messrs. Hanaway, Davis, and
Scarlett, was served in appropriate style in the room of Mr. Morrison,
one of the keepers. The U.S. Marshal, A.E. Roberts, Esq., several of the
keepers, and Mr. Hanes, one of the prison officers, dined with the
prisoners as their guests. Mayor Charles Gilpin was also present and
accepted an invitation to test the quality of the luxuries, thus
significantly indicating that he was not the enemy of Freedom.

Mrs. Martha Hanaway, the wife of the "traitor" of that name, and who had
spent most of her time with her husband since his incarceration, served
each of the twenty-seven colored "traitors" with a plate of the
delicacies, and the supply being greater than the demand, the balance
was served to outsiders in other cells on the same corridor.

The pro-slavery party were very indignant over the matter, and the Hon.
Mr. Brent thought it incumbent upon him to bring this high-handed
procedure to the notice of the Court, where he received a few crumbs of
sympathy, from the pro-slavery side, of course. But the dinner had been
so handsomely arranged, and coming from the source that it did, it had a
very telling effect. Long before this, however, Mr. T.L. Kane had given
abundant evidence that he approved of the Underground Rail Road, and was
a decided opponent of the Fugitive Slave Law; in short, that he believed
in freedom for all men, irrespective of race or color.

Castnor Hanaway was first to be tried; over him, therefore, the great
contest was to be made. For the defence of this particular case, the
abolitionists selected J.M. Read, Thaddeus Stevens, Joseph S. Lewis and
Theodore Cuyler, Esqs. On the side of the Fugitive Slave Law, and
against the "traitors," were U.S. District Attorney, John W. Ashmead,
Hon. James Cooper, James R. Ludlow, Esq., and Robert G. Brent, Attorney
General of Maryland. Mr. Brent was allowed to act as "overseer" in
conducting matters on the side of the Fugitive Slave Law. On this
infamous enactment, combined with a corrupted popular sentiment, the
pro-slavery side depended for success. The abolitionists viewed matters
in the light of freedom and humanity, and hopefully relied upon the
justice of their cause and the power of truth to overcome and swallow up
all the Pharaoh's rods of serpents as fast as they might be thrown down.

The prisoners having lain in their cells nearly three months, the time
for their trial arrived. Monday morning, November 24th, the contest
began. The first three days were occupied in procuring jurors. The
pro-slavery side desired none but such as believed in the Fugitive Slave
law and in "Treason" as expounded in the Judge's charge and the finding
of the Grand Jury.

The counsel for the "Traitors" carefully weighed the jurors, and when
found wanting challenged them; in so doing, they managed to get rid of
most all of that special class upon whom the prosecution depended for a
conviction. The jury having been sworn in, the battle commenced in good
earnest, and continued unabated for nearly two weeks. It is needless to
say, that the examinations and arguments would fill volumes, and were of
the most deeply interesting nature.

No attempt can here be made to recite the particulars of the trial other
than by a mere reference. It was, doubtless, the most important trial
that ever took place in this country relative to the Underground Rail
Road passengers, and in its results more good was brought out of evil
than can easily be estimated. The pro-slavery theories of treason were
utterly demolished, and not a particle of room was left the advocates of
the peculiar institution to hope, that slave-hunters in future, in quest
of fugitives, would be any more safe than Gorsuch. The tide of public
sentiment changed--Hanaway, and the other "traitors," began to be looked
upon as having been greatly injured, and justly entitled to public
sympathy and honor, while confusion of face, disappointment and chagrin
were plainly visible throughout the demoralized ranks of the enemy.
Hanaway was victorious.

An effort was next made to convict Thompson, one of the colored
"traitors." To defend the colored prisoners, the old Abolition Society
had retained Thaddeus Stevens, David Paul Brown, William S. Pierce, and
Robert P. Kane, Esqs., (son of Judge Kane). Stevens, Brown and Pierce
were well-known veterans, defenders of the slave wherever and whenever
called upon so to do. In the present case, they were prepared for a
gallant stand and a long siege against opposing forces. Likewise, R.P.
Kane, Esq., although a young volunteer in the anti-slavery war, brought
to the work great zeal, high attainments, large sympathy and true pluck,
while, in view of all the circumstances, the committee of arrangements
felt very much gratified to have him in their ranks.

By this time, however, the sandy foundations of "overseer" Brent and
Co., (on the part of slavery), had been so completely swept away by the
Hon. J.M. Read and Co., on the side of freedom, that there was but
little chance left to deal heavy blows upon the defeated advocates of
the Fugitive Slave Law. Thompson was pronounced "not guilty." The other
prisoners, of course, shared the same good luck. The victory was then
complete, equally as much so as at Christiana. Underground Rail Road
stock arose rapidly and a feeling of universal rejoicing pervaded the
friends of freedom from one end of the country to the other.

Especially were slave-holders taught the wholesome lesson, that the
Fugitive Slave Law was no guarantee against "red hot shot," nor the
charges of U.S. Judges and the findings of Grand Juries, together with
the superior learning of counsel from slave-holding Maryland, any
guarantee that "traitors" would be hung. In every respect, the
Underground Rail Road made capital by the treason. Slave-holders from
Maryland especially were far less disposed to hunt their runaway
property than they had hitherto been. The Deputy Marshal likewise
considered the business of catching slaves very unsafe.

WILLIAM AND ELLEN CRAFT.


FEMALE SLAVE IN MALE ATTIRE, FLEEING AS A PLANTER, WITH HER HUSBAND AS
HER BODY SERVANT.


A quarter of a century ago, William and Ellen Craft were slaves in the
State of Georgia. With them, as with thousands of others, the desire to
be free was very strong. For this jewel they were willing to make any
sacrifice, or to endure any amount of suffering. In this state of mind
they commenced planning. After thinking of various ways that might be
tried, it occurred to William and Ellen, that one might act the part of
master and the other the part of servant.

Ellen being fair enough to pass for white, of necessity would have to be
transformed into a young planter for the time being. All that was
needed, however, to make this important change was that she should be
dressed elegantly in a fashionable suit of male attire, and have her
hair cut in the style usually worn by young planters. Her profusion of
dark hair offered a fine opportunity for the change. So far this plan
looked very tempting. But it occurred to them that Ellen was beardless.
After some mature reflection, they came to the conclusion that this
difficulty could be very readily obviated by having the face muffled up
as though the young planter was suffering badly with the face or
toothache; thus they got rid of this trouble. Straightway, upon further
reflection, several other very serious difficulties stared them in the
face. For instance, in traveling, they knew that they would be under the
necessity of stopping repeatedly at hotels, and that the custom of
registering would have to be conformed to, unless some very good excuse
could be given for not doing so.

Here they again, thought much over matters, and wisely concluded that
the young man had better assume the attitude of a gentleman very much
indisposed. He must have his right arm placed carefully in a sling; that
would be a sufficient excuse for not registering, etc. Then he must be a
little lame, with a nice cane in the left hand; he must have large green
spectacles over his eyes, and withal he must be very hard of hearing and
dependent on his faithful servant (as was no uncommon thing with
slave-holders), to look after all his wants.

William was just the man to act this part. To begin with, he was very
"likely-looking;" smart, active and exceedingly attentive to his young
master--indeed he was almost eyes, ears, hands and feet for him. William
knew that this would please the slave-holders. The young planter would
have nothing to do but hold himself subject to his ailments and put on a
bold air of superiority; he was not to deign to notice anybody. If,
while traveling, gentlemen, either politely or rudely, should venture to
scrape acquaintance with the young planter, in his deafness he was to
remain mute; the servant was to explain. In every instance when this
occurred, as it actually did, the servant was fully equal to the
emergency--none dreaming of the disguises in which the Underground Rail
Road passengers were traveling.

They stopped at a first-class hotel in Charleston, where the young
planter and his body servant were treated, as the house was wont to
treat the chivalry. They stopped also at a similar hotel in Richmond,
and with like results.

They knew that they must pass through Baltimore, but they did not know
the obstacles that they would have to surmount in the Monumental City.
They proceeded to the depot in the usual manner, and the servant asked
for tickets for his master and self. Of course the master could have a
ticket, but "bonds will have to be entered before you can get a ticket,"
said the ticket master. "It is the rule of this office to require bonds
for all negroes applying for tickets to go North, and none but gentlemen
of well-known responsibility will be taken," further explained the
ticket master.

The servant replied, that he knew "nothing about that"--that he was
"simply traveling with his young master to take care of him--he being in
a very delicate state of health, so much so, that fears were entertained
that he might not be able to hold out to reach Philadelphia, where he
was hastening for medical treatment," and ended his reply by saying, "my
master can't be detained." Without further parley, the ticket master
very obligingly waived the old "rule," and furnished the requisite
tickets. The mountain being thus removed, the young planter and his
faithful servant were safely in the cars for the city of Brotherly Love.

Scarcely had they arrived on free soil when the rheumatism departed--the
right arm was unslung--the toothache was gone--the beardless face was
unmuffled--the deaf heard and spoke--the blind saw--and the lame leaped
as an hart, and in the presence of a few astonished friends of the
slave, the facts of this unparalleled Underground Rail Road feat were
fully established by the most unquestionable evidence.

The constant strain and pressure on Ellen's nerves, however, had tried
her severely, so much so, that for days afterwards, she was physically
very much prostrated, although joy and gladness beamed from her eyes,
which bespoke inexpressible delight within.

Never can the writer forget the impression made by their arrival. Even
now, after a lapse of nearly a quarter of a century, it is easy to
picture them in a private room, surrounded by a few friends--Ellen in
her fine suit of black, with her cloak and high-heeled boots, looking,
in every respect, like a young gentleman; in an hour after having
dropped her male attire, and assumed the habiliments of her sex the
feminine only was visible in every line and feature of her structure.

Her husband, William, was thoroughly colored, but was a man of marked
natural abilities, of good manners, and full of pluck, and possessed of
perceptive faculties very large.

It was necessary, however, in those days, that they should seek a
permanent residence, where their freedom would be more secure than in
Philadelphia; therefore they were advised to go to headquarters,
directly to Boston. There they would be safe, it was supposed, as it had
then been about a generation since a fugitive had been taken back from
the old Bay State, and through the incessant labors of William Lloyd
Garrison, the great pioneer, and his faithful coadjutors, it was
conceded that another fugitive slave case could never be tolerated on
the free soil of Massachusetts. So to Boston they went.

On arriving, the warm hearts of abolitionists welcomed them heartily,
and greeted and cheered them without let or hindrance. They did not
pretend to keep their coming a secret, or hide it under a bushel; the
story of their escape was heralded broadcast over the country--North and
South, and indeed over the civilized world. For two years or more, not
the slightest fear was entertained that they were not just as safe in
Boston as if they had gone to Canada. But the day the Fugitive Bill
passed, even the bravest abolitionist began to fear that a fugitive
slave was no longer safe anywhere under the stars and stripes, North or
South, and that William and Ellen Craft were liable to be captured at
any moment by Georgia slave hunters. Many abolitionists counselled
resistance to the death at all hazards. Instead of running to Canada,
fugitives generally armed themselves and thus said, "Give me liberty or
give me death."

William and Ellen Craft believed that it was their duty, as citizens of
Massachusetts, to observe a more legal and civilized mode of conforming
to the marriage rite than had been permitted them in slavery, and as
Theodore Parker had shown himself a very warm friend of their's, they
agreed to have their wedding over again according to the laws of a free
State. After performing the ceremony, the renowned and fearless advocate
of equal rights (Theodore Parker), presented William with a revolver and
a dirk-knife, counselling him to use them manfully in defence of his
wife and himself, if ever an attempt should be made by his owners or
anybody else to re-enslave them.

But, notwithstanding all the published declarations made by
abolitionists and fugitives, to the effect, that slave-holders and
slave-catchers in visiting Massachusetts in pursuit of their runaway
property, would be met by just such weapons as Theodore Parker presented
William with, to the surprise of all Boston, the owners of William and
Ellen actually had the effrontery to attempt their recapture under the
Fugitive Slave Law. How it was done, and the results, taken from the
_Old Liberator_, (William Lloyd Garrison's organ), we copy as follows:


    From the "Liberator," Nov. 1, 1850.

    SLAVE-HUNTERS IN BOSTON.

    Our city, for a week past, has been thrown into a state of
    intense excitement by the appearance of two prowling villains,
    named Hughes and Knight, from Macon, Georgia, for the purpose of
    seizing William and Ellen Craft, under the infernal Fugitive
    Slave Bill, and carrying them back to the hell of Slavery. Since
    the day of '76, there has not been such a popular demonstration
    on the side of human freedom in this region. The humane and
    patriotic contagion has infected all classes. Scarcely any other
    subject has been talked about in the streets, or in the social
    circle. On Thursday, of last week, warrants for the arrest of
    William and Ellen were issued by Judge Levi Woodbury, but no
    officer has yet been found ready or bold enough to serve them.
    In the meantime, the Vigilance Committee, appointed at the
    Faneuil Hall meeting, has not been idle. Their number has been
    increased to upwards of a hundred "good men and true," including
    some thirty or forty members of the bar; and they have been in
    constant session, devising every legal method to baffle the
    pursuing bloodhounds, and relieve the city of their hateful
    presence. On Saturday placards were posted up in all directions,
    announcing the arrival of these slave-hunters, and describing
    their persons. On the same day, Hughes and Knight were arrested
    on the charge of slander against William Craft. The Chronotype
    says, the damages being laid at $10,000; bail was demanded in
    the same sum, and was promptly furnished. By whom? is the
    question. An immense crowd was assembled in front of the
    Sheriff's office, while the bail matter was being arranged. The
    reporters were not admitted. It was only known that Watson
    Freeman, Esq., who once declared his readiness to hang any
    number of negroes remarkably cheap, came in, saying that the
    arrest was a shame, all a humbug, the trick of the damned
    abolitionists, and proclaimed his readiness to stand bail. John
    H. Pearson was also sent for, and came--the same John H.
    Pearson, merchant and Southern packet agent, who immortalized
    himself by sending back, on the 10th of September, 1846, in the
    bark Niagara, a poor fugitive slave, who came secreted in the
    brig Ottoman, from New Orleans--being himself judge, jury and
    executioner, to consign a fellow-being to a life of bondage--in
    obedience to the law of a slave State, and in violation of the
    law of his own. This same John H. Pearson, not contented with
    his previous infamy, was on hand. There is a story that the
    slave-hunters have been his table-guests also, and whether he
    bailed them or not, we don't know. What we know is, that soon
    after Pearson came out from the back room, where he and Knight
    and the Sheriff had been closeted, the Sheriff said that Knight
    was bailed--he would not say by whom. Knight being looked after,
    was not to be found. He had slipped out through a back door, and
    thus cheated the crowd of the pleasure of greeting him--possibly
    with that rough and ready affection which Barclay's brewers
    bestowed upon Haynau. The escape was very fortunate every way.
    Hughes and Knight have since been twice arrested and put under
    bonds of $10,000 (making $30,000 in all), charged with a
    conspiracy to kidnap and abduct William Craft, a peaceable
    citizen of Massachusetts, etc. Bail was entered by Hamilton
    Willis, of Willis & Co., 25 State street, and Patrick Riley,
    U.S. Deputy Marshal.

    The following (says the Chronotype), is a _verbatim et
    literatim_ copy of the letter sent by Knight to Craft, to entice
    him to the U.S. Hotel, in order to kidnap him. It shows, that
    the school-master owes Knight more "service and labor" than it
    is possible for Craft to:


        BOSTON, Oct. 22, 1850, 11 Oclk P.M.

        Wm. Craft--Sir--I have to leave so Eirley in the moring
        that I cold not call according to promis, so if you want
        me to carry a letter home with me, you must bring it to
        the United States Hotel to morrow and leave it in box
        44, or come your self to morro eavening after tea and
        bring it. let me no if you come your self by sending a
        note to box 44 U.S. Hotel so that I may know whether to
        wate after tea or not by the Bearer. If your wife wants
        to see me you cold bring her with you if you come your
        self.

        JOHN KNIGHT.

        P.S. I shall leave for home eirley a Thursday moring.
        J.K.


    At a meeting of colored people, held in Belknap Street Church,
    on Friday evening, the following resolutions were unanimously
    adopted:


        _Resolved_, That God willed us free; man willed us
        slaves. We will as God wills; God's will be done.

        _Resolved_, That our oft repeated determination to
        resist oppression is the same now as ever, and we pledge
        ourselves, at all hazards, to resist unto death any
        attempt upon our liberties.

        _Resolved_, That as South Carolina seizes and imprisons
        colored seamen from the North, under the plea that it is
        to prevent insurrection and rebellion among her colored
        population, the authorities of this State, and city in
        particular, be requested to lay hold of, and put in
        prison, immediately, any and all fugitive slave-hunters
        who may be found among us, upon the same ground, and for
        similar reasons.


    Spirited addresses, of a most emphatic type, were made by
    Messrs. Remond, of Salem, Roberts, Nell, and Allen, of Boston,
    and Davis, of Plymouth. Individuals and highly respectable
    committees of gentlemen have repeatedly waited upon these
    Georgia miscreants, to persuade them to make a speedy departure
    from the city. After promising to do so, and repeatedly
    falsifying their word, it is said that they left on Wednesday
    afternoon, in the express train for New York, and thus (says the
    Chronotype), they have "gone off with their ears full of fleas,
    to fire the solemn word for the dissolution of the Union!"

    Telegraphic intelligence is received, that President Fillmore
    has announced his determination to sustain the Fugitive Slave
    Bill, at all hazards. Let him try! The fugitives, as well as the
    colored people generally, seem determined to carry out the
    spirit of the resolutions to their fullest extent.


Ellen first received information that the slave-hunters from Georgia
were after her through Mrs. Geo. S. Hilliard, of Boston, who had been a
good friend to her from the day of her arrival from slavery. How Mrs.
Hilliard obtained the information, the impression it made on Ellen, and
where she was secreted, the following extract of a letter written by
Mrs. Hilliard, touching the memorable event, will be found deeply
interesting:


    "In regard to William and Ellen Craft, it is true that we
    received her at our house when the first warrant under the act
    of eighteen hundred and fifty was issued.

    Dr. Bowditch called upon us to say, that the warrant must be for
    William and Ellen, as they were the only fugitives here known to
    have come from Georgia, and the Dr. asked what we could do. I
    went to the house of the Rev. F.T. Gray, on Mt. Vernon street,
    where Ellen was working with Miss Dean, an upholsteress, a
    friend of ours, who had told us she would teach Ellen her trade.
    I proposed to Ellen to come and do some work for me, intending
    not to alarm her. My manner, which I supposed to be indifferent
    and calm, _betrayed_ me, and she threw herself into my arms,
    sobbing and weeping. She, however, recovered her composure as
    soon as we reached the street, and was _very firm_ ever after.

    My husband wished her, by all means, to be brought to our house,
    and to remain under his protection, saying 'I am perfectly
    willing to meet the penalty, should she be found here, but will
    never give her up.' The penalty, you remember, was six months'
    imprisonment and a thousand dollars fine. William Craft went,
    after a time, to Lewis Hayden. He was at first, as Dr. Bowditch
    told us, 'barricaded in his shop on Cambridge street.' I saw him
    there, and he said, 'Ellen must not be left at your house.'
    'Why? William,' said I, 'do you think we would give her up?'
    'Never,' said he, 'but Mr. Hilliard is not only our friend, but
    he is a U.S. Commissioner, and should Ellen be found in his
    house, he must resign his office, as well as incur the penalty
    of the law, and I will not subject a friend to such a punishment
    for the sake of our safety.' Was not this noble, when you think
    how small was the penalty that any one could receive for aiding
    slaves to escape, compared to the fate which threatened them in
    case they were captured? William C. made the same objection to
    having his wife taken to Mr. Ellis Gray Loring's, he also being
    a friend and a Commissioner."


This deed of humanity and Christian charity is worthy to be commemorated
and classed with the act of the good Samaritan, as the same spirit is
shown in both cases. Often was Mrs. Hilliard's house an asylum for
fugitive slaves.

After the hunters had left the city in dismay, and the storm of
excitement had partially subsided, the friends of William and Ellen
concluded that they had better seek a country where they would not be in
daily fear of slave-catchers, backed by the Government of the United
States. They were, therefore, advised to go to Great Britain. Outfits
were liberally provided for them, passages procured, and they took their
departure for a habitation in a foreign land.

Much might be told concerning the warm reception they met with from the
friends of humanity on every hand, during a stay in England of nearly a
score of years, but we feel obliged to make the following extract
suffice:



EXTRACT OF A LETTER FROM WM. FARMER, ESQ., OF LONDON, TO WM. LLOYD
GARRISON, JUNE 26, 1851--"FUGITIVE SLAVES AT THE GREAT EXHIBITION."



    Fortunately, we have, at the present moment, in the British
    Metropolis, some specimens of what were once American "chattels
    personal," in the persons of William and Ellen Craft, and
    William W. Brown, and their friends resolved that they should be
    exhibited under the world's huge glass case, in order that the
    world might form its opinion of the alleged mental inferiority
    of the African race, and their fitness or unfitness for freedom.
    A small party of anti-slavery friends was accordingly formed to
    accompany the fugitives through the Exhibition. Mr. and Mrs.
    Estlin, of Bristol, and a lady friend, Mr. and Mrs. Richard
    Webb, of Dublin, and a son and daughter, Mr. McDonnell, (a most
    influential member of the Executive Committee of the National
    Reform Association--one of our unostentatious, but highly
    efficient workers for reform in this country, and whose public
    and private acts, if you were acquainted with, you would feel
    the same esteem and affection for him as is felt towards him by
    Mr. Thompson, myself and many others)--these ladies and
    gentlemen, together with myself, met at Mr. Thompson's house,
    and, in company with Mrs. Thompson, and Miss Amelia Thompson,
    the Crafts and Brown, proceeded from thence to the Exhibition.
    Saturday was selected, as a day upon which the largest number of
    the aristocracy and wealthy classes attend the Crystal Palace,
    and the company was, on this occasion, the most distinguished
    that had been gathered together within its walls since its
    opening day. Some fifteen thousand, mostly of the upper classes,
    were there congregated, including the Queen, Prince Albert, and
    the royal children, the anti-slavery Duchess of Sutherland, (by
    whom the fugitives were evidently favorably regarded), the Duke
    of Wellington, the Bishops of Winchester and St. Asaph, a large
    number of peers, peeresses, members of Parliament, merchants and
    bankers, and distinguished men from almost all parts of the
    world, surpassing, in variety of tongue, character and costume,
    the description of the population of Jerusalem on the day of
    Pentecost--a season of which it is hoped the Great Exhibition
    will prove a type, in the copious outpouring of the holy spirit
    of brotherly union, and the consequent diffusion, throughout the
    world, of the anti-slavery gospel of good will to all men.

    In addition to the American exhibitors, it so happened that the
    American visitors were particularly numerous, among whom the
    experienced eyes of Brown and the Crafts enabled them to detect
    slave-holders by dozens. Mr. McDonnell escorted Mrs. Craft, and
    Mrs. Thompson; Miss Thompson, at her own request, took the arm
    of Wm. Wells Brown, whose companion she elected to be for the
    day; Wm. Craft walked with Miss Amelia Thompson and myself. This
    arrangement was purposely made in order that there might be no
    appearance of patronizing the fugitives, but that it might be
    shown that we regarded them as our equals, and honored them for
    their heroic escape from Slavery. Quite contrary to the feeling
    of ordinary visitors, the American department was our chief
    attraction. Upon arriving at Powers' Greek Slave, our glorious
    anti-slavery friend, Punch's 'Virginia Slave' was produced. I
    hope you have seen this production of our great humorous
    moralist. It is an admirably-drawn figure of a female slave in
    chains, with the inscription beneath, 'The Virginia Slave, a
    companion for Powers' Greek Slave.' The comparison of the two
    soon drew a small crowd, including several Americans, around and
    near us. Although they refrained from any audible expression of
    feeling, the object of the comparison was evidently understood
    and keenly felt. It would not have been prudent in us to have
    challenged, in words, an anti-slavery discussion in the World's
    Convention; but everything that we could with propriety do was
    done to induce them to break silence upon the subject. We had no
    intention, verbally, of taking the initiative in such a
    discussion; we confined ourselves to speaking at them, in order
    that they might be led to speak to us; but our efforts were of
    no avail. The gauntlet, which was unmistakably thrown down by
    our party, the Americans were too wary to take up. We spoke
    among each other of the wrongs of Slavery; it was in vain. We
    discoursed freely upon the iniquity of a professedly Christian
    Republic holding three millions of its population in cruel and
    degrading bondage; you might as well have preached to the winds.
    Wm. Wells Brown took 'Punch's Virginia Slave' and deposited it
    within the enclosure by the 'Greek Slave,' saying audibly, 'As
    an American fugitive slave, I place this 'Virginia Slave' by the
    side of the 'Greek Slave,' as its most fitting companion.' Not a
    word, or reply, or remonstrance from Yankee or Southerner. We
    had not, however, proceeded many steps from the place before the
    'Virginia Slave' was removed. We returned to the statue, and
    stood near the American by whom it had been taken up, to give
    him an opportunity of making any remarks he chose upon the
    matter. Whatever were his feelings, his policy was to keep his
    lips closed. If he had felt that the act was wrongful, would he
    not have appealed to the sense of justice of the British
    bystanders, who are always ready to resist an insult offered to
    a foreigner in this country? If it was an insult, why not resent
    it, as became high-spirited Americans? But no; the chivalry of
    the South tamely allowed itself to be plucked by the beard; the
    garrulity of the North permitted itself to be silenced by three
    fugitive slaves.... We promenaded the Exhibition between six and
    seven hours, and visited nearly every portion of the vast
    edifice. Among the thousands whom we met in our perambulations,
    who dreamed of any impropriety in a gentleman of character and
    standing, like Mr. McDonnell, walking arm-in-arm with a colored
    woman; or an elegant and accomplished young lady, like Miss
    Thompson, (daughter of the Hon. George Thompson, M.C.), becoming
    the promenading companion of a colored man? Did the English
    peers or peeresses? Not the most aristocratic among them. Did
    the representatives of any other country have their notions of
    propriety shocked by the matter? None but Americans. To see the
    arm of a beautiful English young lady passed through that of 'a
    nigger,' taking ices and other refreshments with him, upon terms
    of the most perfect equality, certainly was enough to 'rile,'
    and evidently did 'rile' the slave-holders who beheld it; but
    there was no help for it. Even the New York Broadway bullies
    would not have dared to utter a word of insult, much less lift a
    finger against Wm. Wells Brown, when walking with his fair
    companion in the World's Exhibition. It was a circumstance not
    to be forgotten by these Southern Bloodhounds. Probably, for the
    first time in their lives, they felt themselves thoroughly
    muzzled; they dared not even to bark, much less bite. Like the
    meanest curs, they had to sneak through the Crystal Palace,
    unnoticed and uncared for; while the victims who had been
    rescued from their jaws, were warmly greeted by visitors from
    all parts of the country.



       *       *       *       *       *


Brown and the Crafts have paid several other visits to the Great
Exhibition, in one of which, Wm. Craft succeeded in getting some
Southerners "out" upon the Fugitive Slave Bill, respecting which a
discussion was held between them in the American department. Finding
themselves worsted at every point, they were compelled to have recourse
to lying, and unblushingly denied that the bill contained the provisions
which Craft alleged it did. Craft took care to inform them who and what
he was. He told them that there had been too much information upon that
measure diffused in England for lying to conceal them. He has
subsequently met the same parties, who, with contemptible hypocrisy,
treated "the nigger" with great respect.

In England the Crafts were highly respected. While under her British
Majesty's protection, Ellen became the mother of several children,
(having had none under the stars and stripes). These they spared no
pains in educating for usefulness in the world. Some two years since
William and Ellen returned with two of their children to the United
States, and after visiting Boston and other places, William concluded to
visit Georgia, his old home, with a view of seeing what inducement war
had opened up to enterprise, as he had felt a desire to remove his
family thither, if encouraged. Indeed he was prepared to purchase a
plantation, if he found matters satisfactory. This visit evidently
furnished the needed encouragement, judging from the fact that he did
purchase a plantation somewhere in the neighborhood of Savannah, and is
at present living there with his family.

The portraits of William and Ellen represent them at the present stage
of life, (as citizens of the U.S.)--of course they have greatly changed
in appearance from what they were when they first fled from Georgia.
Obviously the Fugitive Slave Law in its crusade against William and
Ellen Craft, reaped no advantages, but on the contrary, liberty was
greatly the gainer.

ARRIVALS FROM RICHMOND.


LEWIS COBB AND NANCY BRISTER.


No one Southern city furnished a larger number of brave, wide-awake and
likely-looking Underground Rail Road passengers than the city of
Richmond. Lewis and Nancy were fair specimens of the class of travelers
coming from that city. Lewis was described as a light yellow man, medium
size, good-looking, and intelligent. In referring to bondage, he spoke
with great earnestness, and in language very easily understood;
especially when speaking of Samuel Myers, from whom he escaped, he did
not hesitate to give him the character of being a very hard man, who was
never satisfied, no matter how hard the slaves might try to please him.

Myers was engaged in the commission and forwarding business, and was a
man of some standing in Richmond. From him Lewis had received very
severe floggings, the remembrance of which he would not only carry with
him to Canada, but to the grave. It was owing to abuse of this kind that
he was awakened to look for a residence under the protection of the
British Lion. For eight months he longed to get away, and had no rest
until he found himself on the Underground Rail Road.

His master was a member of the Century Methodist Church, as was also his
wife and family; but Lewis thought that they were strangers to practical
Christianity, judging from the manner that the slaves were treated by
both master and mistress. Lewis was a Baptist, and belonged to the
second church. Twelve hundred dollars had been offered for him. He left
his father (Judville), and his brother, John Harris, both slaves. In
view of his prospects in Canada, Lewis' soul overflowed with pleasing
anticipations of freedom, and the Committee felt great satisfaction in
assisting him.

Nancy was also from Richmond, and came in the same boat with Lewis. She
represented the most "likely-looking female bond servants." Indeed her
appearance recommended her at once. She was neat, modest, and
well-behaved--with a good figure and the picture of health, with a
countenance beaming with joy and gladness, notwithstanding the late
struggles and sufferings through which she had passed. Young as she was,
she had seen much of slavery, and had, doubtless, profited by the
lessons thereof. At all events, it was through cruel treatment, having
been frequently beaten after she had passed her eighteenth year, that
she was prompted to seek freedom. It was so common for her mistress to
give way to unbridled passions that Nancy never felt safe. Under the
severest infliction of punishment she was not allowed to complain.
Neither from mistress nor master had she any reason to expect mercy or
leniency--indeed she saw no way of escape but by the Underground Rail
Road.

It was true that the master, Mr. William Bears, was a Yankee from
Connecticut, and his wife a member of the Episcopal Church, but Nancy's
yoke seemed none the lighter for all that. Fully persuaded that she
would never find her lot any better while remaining in their hands, she
accepted the advice and aid of a young man to whom she was engaged; he
was shrewd enough to find an agent in Richmond, with whom he entered
into a covenant to have Nancy brought away. With a cheerful heart the
journey was undertaken in the manner aforesaid, and she safely reached
the Committee. Her mother, one brother and a sister she had to leave in
Richmond. One thousand dollars were lost in the departure of Nancy.

Having been accommodated and aided by the Committee, they were forwarded
to Canada. Lewis wrote back repeatedly and expressed himself very
gratefully for favors received, as will be seen by the appended letters
from him:


    TORONTO, April 25, 1857.

    To MR. WM. STILL--Dear Sir:--I take this opportunity of
    addressing these few lines to inform you that I am well and hope
    that they may find you and your family enjoying the same good
    health. Please to give my love to you and your family. I had a
    very pleasant trip from your house that morning. Dear sir, you
    would oblige me much, if you have not sent that box to Mr.
    Robinson, to open it and take out the little yellow box that I
    tied up in the large one and send it on by express to me in
    Toronto. Lift up a few of the things and you will find it near
    the top. All the clothes that I have are in that box and I stand
    in need of them. You would oblige me much by so doing. I stopped
    at Mr. Jones' in Elmira, and was very well treated by him while
    there. I am now in Toronto and doing very well at present. I am
    very thankful to you and your family for the attention you paid
    to me while at your house. I wish you would see Mr. Ormsted and
    ask him if he has not some things for Mr. Anthony Loney, and if
    he has, please send them on with my things, as we are both
    living together at this time. Give my love to Mr. Anthony, also
    to Mr. Ormsted and family. Dear sir, we both would be very glad
    for you to attend to this, as we both do stand very much in need
    of them at this time. Dear sir, you will oblige me by giving my
    love to Miss Frances Watkins, and as she said she hoped to be
    out in the summer, I should like to see her. I have met with a
    gentleman here by the name of Mr. Truehart, and he sends his
    best love to you and your family. Mr. Truehart desires to know
    whether you received the letter he sent to you, and if so,
    answer it as soon as possible. Please answer this letter as soon
    as possible. I must now come to a close by saying that I remain
    your beloved friend,

    LEWIS COBB.

    The young man who was there that morning, Mr. Robinson, got
    married to that young lady.





    TORONTO, June 2d, 1857.

    To MR. WM. STILL--Dear Sir:--I received yours dated May 6th, and
    was extremely happy to hear from you. You may be surprised that
    I have not answered you before this, but it was on account of
    not knowing anything concerning the letter being in the
    post-office until I was told so by a friend. The box, of which I
    had been inquiring, I have received, and am infinitely obliged
    to you for sending it. Mr. and Mrs. Renson are living in
    Hamilton, C.W. They send their best love to you and your family.
    I am at present residing in Toronto, C.W. Mr. Anthony Loney has
    gone on to Boston, and is desirous of my coming on to him; and
    as I have many acquaintances there, I should like to know from
    you whether it would be advisable or not. Give, if you please,
    my best love to your family and accept the same for yourself,
    and also to Mr. James Ormsted and family. Tell James Ormsted I
    would be glad if he would send me a pair of thick, heavy boots,
    for it rains and hails as often out here in the summer, as it
    does there in the winter. Tell him to send No. 9, and anything
    he thinks will do me good in this cold country. Please to give
    to Mr. James Ormsted to give to Mr. Robert Seldon, and tell him
    to give it to my father. Mr. and Mrs. Truehart send their love
    to you and your family. If the gentleman, Mr. R.S., is not
    running on the boat now, you can give directions to Ludwill
    Cobb, in care of Mr. R. Seldon, Richmond, Va. Tell Mr. Ormsted
    not to forget my boots and send them by express. No more at
    present, but remain yours very truly,

    Please write soon.

    LEWIS COBB.

PASSENGERS FROM NORTH CAROLINA.


[BY SCHOONER.]


MAJOR LATHAM, WILLIAM WILSON, HENRY GORHAM, WILEY MADDISON, AND ANDREW
SHEPHERD.

The above named passengers were delivered into the hands of Thomas
Garrett by the Captain who brought them, and were aided and forwarded to
the Committee in Philadelphia, as indicated by the subjoined letter:


    WILMINGTON, 11th mo., 6th, 1856.

    RESPECTED FRIEND:--WILLIAM STILL:--Thine of yesterday, came to
    hand this morning, advising me to forward those four men to
    thee, which I propose to send from here in the steam boat, at
    two o'clock, P.M. to day to thy care; one of them thinks he has
    a brother and cousin in New Bedford, and is anxious to get to
    them, the others thee can do what thee thinks best with, after
    consulting with them, we have rigged them up pretty comfortably
    with clothes, and I have paid for their passage to Philadelphia,
    and also for the passage of their pilot there and back; he
    proposed to ask thee for three dollars, for the three days time
    he lost with them, but that we will raise here for him, as one
    of them expects to have some money brought from Carolina soon,
    that belongs to him, and wants thee when they are fixed, to let
    me know so that I may forward it to them. I will give each of
    them a card of our firm. Hoping they may get along safe, I
    remain as ever, thy sincere friend,

    THOS. GARRETT.


The passengers by this arrival were above the ordinary plantation or
farm hand slave, as will appear from a glance at their condition under
the yoke.



Major Latham was forty-four years of age, mulatto, very resolute, with
good natural abilities, and a decided hater of slavery. John Latham was
the man whom he addressed as "master," which was a very bitter pill for
him to swallow. He had been married twice, and at the time of his escape
he was the husband of two wives. The first one, with their three
children, in consequence of changes incident to slave life, was sold a
long distance from her old home and husband, thereby ending the
privilege of living together; he could think of them, but that was all;
he was compelled to give them up altogether. After a time he took to
himself another wife, with whom he lived several years. Three more
children owned him as father--the result of this marriage. During his
entire manhood Major had been brutally treated by his master, which
caused him a great deal of anguish and trouble of mind.

Only a few weeks before he escaped, his master, in one of his fits of
passion, flogged him most cruelly. From that time the resolution was
permanently grounded in his mind to find the way to freedom, if
possible, before many more weeks had passed. Day and night he studied,
worked and planned, with freedom uppermost in his mind. The hour of hope
arrived and with it Captain F.



William, a fellow-passenger with Major, was forty-two years of age, just
in the prime of life, and represented the mechanics in chains, being a
blacksmith by trade. Dr. Thomas Warren, who followed farming in the
neighborhood of Eatontown, was the owner of William. In speaking of his
slave life William said: "I was sold four times; twice I was separated
from my wives. I was separated from one of my wives when living in
Portsmouth, Virginia," etc.

In his simple manner of describing the trials he had been called upon to
endure, it was not to be wondered at that he was willing to forsake all
and run fearful risks in order to rid himself not only of the "load on
his back," but the load on his heart. By the very positive character of
William's testimony against slavery, the Committee felt more than ever
justified in encouraging the Underground Rail Road.



Henry Gorham was thirty-four years of age, a "prime," heavy, dark,
smart, "article," and a good carpenter. He admitted that he had never
felt the lash on his back, but, nevertheless, he had felt deeply on the
subject of slavery. For years the chief concern with him was as to how
he could safely reach a free State. Slavery he hated with a perfect
hatred. To die in the woods, live in a cave, or sacrifice himself in
some way, he was bound to do, rather than remain a slave. The more he
reflected over his condition the more determined he grew to seek his
freedom. Accordingly he left and went to the woods; there he prepared
himself a cave and resolved to live and die in it rather than return to
bondage. Before he found his way out of the prison-house eleven months
elapsed. His strong impulse for freedom, and intense aversion to
slavery, sustained him until he found an opportunity to escape by the
Underground Rail Road.

One of the tried Agents of the Underground Rail Road was alone cognizant
of his dwelling in the cave, and regarding him as a tolerably safe
passenger (having been so long secreted), secured him a passage on the
schooner, and thus he was fortunately relieved from his eleven months'
residence in his den. No rhetoric or fine scholarship was needed in his
case to make his story interesting. None but hearts of stone could have
listened without emotion.



Andrew, another fellow-passenger, was twenty-six years of age, and a
decidedly inviting-looking specimen of the peculiar institution. He
filled the situation of an engineer. He, with his wife and one child,
belonged to a small orphan girl, who lived at South End, Camden county,
N.C. His wife and child had to be left behind. While it seemed very hard
for a husband thus to leave his wife, every one that did so weakened
slavery and encouraged and strengthened anti-slavery.



Numbered with these four North Carolina passengers is found the name of
Wiley Maddison, a young man nineteen years of age, who escaped from
Petersburg on the cars as a white man. He was of promising appearance,
and found no difficulty whatever on the road. With the rest, however, he
concluded himself hardly safe this side of Canada, and it afforded the
Committee special pleasure to help them all.


THOMAS CLINTON, SAUNEY PRY AND BENJAMIN DUCKET.


PASSED OVER THE U.G.R.R., IN THE FALL OF 1856.




Thomas escaped from Baltimore. He described the man from whom he fled as
a "rum drinker" of some note, by the name of Benjamin Walmsly, and he
testified that under him he was neither "half fed nor clothed," in
consequence of which he was dissatisfied, and fled to better his
condition. Luckily Thomas succeeded in making his escape when about
twenty-one years of age. His appearance and smartness indicated
resolution and gave promise of future success. He was well made and of a
chestnut color.



Sauney Pry came from Loudon Co., Va. He had been one of the "well-cared
for," on the farm of Nathan Clapton, who owned some sixty or seventy
slaves. Upon inquiry as to the treatment and character of his master,
Sauney unhesitatingly described him as a "very mean, swearing,
blustering man, as hard as any that could be started." It was on this
account that he was prompted to turn his face against Virginia and to
venture on the Underground Rail Road. Sauney was twenty-seven years of
age, chestnut color, medium size, and in intellect was at least up to
the average.



Benjamin Ducket came from Bell Mountain, Prince George's Co., Maryland.
He stated to the Committee that he escaped from one Sicke Perry, a
farmer. Of his particular master he spoke thus: "He was one of the
baddest men about Prince George; he would both fight and kill up."

These characteristics of the master developed in Ben very strong desires
to get beyond his reach. In fact, his master's conduct was the sole
cause of his seeking the Underground Rail Road. At the time that he came
to Philadelphia, he was recorded as twenty-three years of age, chestnut
color, medium size, and wide awake. He left his father, mother, two
brothers, and three sisters, owned by Marcus Devoe.

About the same time that the passengers just described received succor,
Elizabeth Lambert, with three children, reached the Committee. The names
of the children were, Mary, Horace, and William Henry, quite
marketable-looking articles.

They fled from Middletown, Delaware, where they had been owned by Andrew
Peterson. The poor mother's excuse for leaving her "comfortable home,
free board, and kind-hearted master and mistress," was simply because
she was tired of such "kindness," and was, therefore, willing to suffer
in order to get away from it.

Hill Jones, a lad of eighteen, accompanied Elizabeth with her children
from Middletown. He had seen enough of Slavery to satisfy him that he
could never relish it. His owner was known by the name of John Cochran,
and followed farming. He was of a chestnut color, and well-grown.



ARRIVALS IN APRIL, 1856.



CHARLES HALL, JAMES JOHNSON, CHARLES CARTER,  GEORGE, AND JOHN LOGAN,
JAMES HENRY WATSON,  ZEBULON GREEN, LEWIS, AND PETER BURRELL,  WILLIAM
WILLIAMS, AND HIS WIFE--HARRIET TUBMAN, WITH FOUR PASSENGERS.




Charles Hall. This individual was from Maryland, Baltimore Co., where
"black men had no rights which white men were bound to respect,"
according to the decision of the late Chief Justice Taney of the Supreme
Court of the United States.

Charles was owned by Atwood A. Blunt, a farmer, much of whose time was
devoted to card playing, rum-drinking and fox-hunting, so Charles
stated. Charles gave him the credit of being as mild a specimen of a
slaveholder as that region of country could claim when in a sober mood,
but when drunk every thing went wrong with him, nothing could satisfy
him.

Charles testified, however, that the despotism of his mistress was much
worse than that of his master, for she was all the time hard on the
slaves. Latterly he had heard much talk about selling, and, believing
that matters would soon have to come to that, he concluded to seek a
place where colored men had rights, in Canada.



James Johnson. James fled from Deer Creek, Harford Co., Md., where he
was owned by William Rautty. "Jim's" hour had come. Within one day of
the time fixed for his sale, he was handcuffed, and it was evidently
supposed that he was secure. Trembling at his impending doom he resolved
to escape if possible. He could not rid himself of the handcuffs. Could
he have done so, he was persuaded that he might manage to make his way
along safely. He resolved to make an effort with the handcuffs on.

With resolution his freedom was secured. What Master Rautty said when he
found his property gone with the handcuffs, we know not.

The next day after Jim arrived, Charles Carter, George and John Logan
came to hand.



Charles had been under the yoke in the city of Richmond, held to service
by Daniel Delaplain, a flour inspector. Charles was hired out by the
flour inspector for as much as he could command for him, for being a
devoted lover of money, ordinary wages hardly ever satisfied him. In
other respects Charles spoke of his master rather favorably in
comparison with slaveholders generally.

A thirty years' apprenticeship as a slave had not, however, won him over
to the love of the system; he had long since been convinced that it was
nonsense to suppose that such a thing as happiness could be found even
under the best of masters. He claimed to have a wife and four little
children living in Alexandria Va.; the name of the wife was Lucinda. In
the estimation of slave-holders, the fact of Charles having a family
might have offered no cause for unhappiness, but Charles felt
differently in relation to the matter. Again, for reasons best known to
the owner, he talked of selling Charles. On this point Charles also felt
quite nervous, so he began to think that he had better make an attempt
to get beyond the reach of buyers and sellers. He knew that many others
similarly situated had got out of bondage simply by hard struggling, and
he felt that he could do likewise. When he had thus determined the
object was half accomplished. True, every step that he should take was
liable to bring trouble upon himself, yet with the hope of freedom
buoying him up he resolved to run the risk. Charles was about thirty
years of age, likely-looking, well made, intelligent, and a mulatto.



George was twenty-three years of age, quite dark, medium size, and bore
the marks of a man of considerable pluck. He was the slave of Mrs. Jane
Coultson. No special complaint of her is recorded on the book. She might
have been a very good mistress, but George was not a very happy and
contented piece of property, as was proved by his course in escaping.
The cold North had many more charms for him than the sunny South.



John has been already described in the person of his brother George. He
was not, however, the property of Mrs. Coultson, but was owned by Miss
Cox, near Little Georgetown, Berkeley Co., Va. These three individuals
were held as slaves by that class of slave-holders, known in the South
as the most kind-hearted and indulgent, yet they seemed just as much
delighted with the prospects of freedom as any other passengers.



The next day following the arrival of the party just noticed James Henry
Watson reached the Committee. He was in good condition, the spring
weather having been favorable, and the journey made without any serious
difficulty.

He was from Snowhill, Worcester county, Md., and had escaped from James
Purnell, a farmer of whom he did not speak very favorably. Yet James
admitted that his master was not as hard on his slaves as some others.

For the benefit of James' kinsfolk, who may still perchance be making
searches for him, not having yet learned whither he went or what became
of him, we copy the following paragraph as entered on our book April
11th, 1856:

James Henry is twenty years of age, dark, well-made, modest, and seems
fearful of apprehension; was moved to escape in order to obtain his
freedom. He had heard of others who had run away and thus secured their
freedom; he thought he could do the same. He left his father, mother,
three brothers and five sisters owned by Purnell. His father's name was
Ephraim, his mother's name Mahala. The names of his sisters and brothers
were as follows: Hetty, Betsy, Dinah, Catharine and Harriet; Homer,
William and James.



Zebulon Green was the next traveler. He arrived from Duck Creek, Md.
John Appleton, a farmer, was chargeable with having deprived Zeb of his
rights. But, as Zeb was only about eighteen years of age when he made
his exit, Mr. Appleton did not get much the start of him. In answer to
the question as to the cause of his escape, he replied "bad usage." He
was smart, and quite dark. In traveling, he changed his name to Samuel
Hill. The Committee endeavored to impress him thoroughly, with the idea
that he could do much good in the world for himself and fellow-men, by
using his best endeavors to acquire education, etc., and forwarded him
on to Canada.



Lewis Burrell and his brother Peter arrived safely from Alexandria,
Virginia, April 21, 1856. Lewis had been owned by Edward M. Clark, Peter
by Benjamin Johnson Hall. These passengers seemed to be well posted in
regard to Slavery, and understood full well their responsibilities in
fleeing from "kind-hearted" masters. All they feared was that they might
not reach Canada safely, although they were pretty hopeful and quite
resolute. Lewis left a wife, Winna Ann, and two children, Joseph and
Mary, who were owned by Pembroke Thomas, at Culpepper, Va., nearly a
hundred miles distant from him. Once or twice in the year, was the
privilege allowed him to visit his wife and little ones at this long
distance. This separation constituted his daily grief and was the cause
of his escape. Lewis and Peter left their father and mother in bondage,
also one brother (Reuben), and three sisters, two of whom had been sold
far South.

After a sojourn in freedom of nearly three years, Lewis wrote on behalf
of his wife as follows:


    TORONTO, C.W., Feb. 2, 1859.

    MR. WM. STILL:

    DEAR SIR:--It have bin two years since I war at your house, at
    that time I war on my way to cannadia, and I tould you that I
    had a wife and had to leave her behind, and you promiest me that
    you would healp me to gait hir if I ever heaird from hir, and I
    think my dear frend, that the time is come for me to strick the
    blow, will you healp me, according to your promis. I recived a
    letter from a frend in Washington last night and he says that my
    wife is in the city of Baltimore, and she will come away if she
    can find a frend to healp hir, so I thought I would writ to you
    as you are acquanted with foulks theare to howm you can trust
    with such matthas. I could write to Mr Noah davis in Baltimore,
    who is well acquanted with my wife, but I do not think that he
    is a trew frend, and I could writ to Mr Samual Maden in the same
    city, but I am afread that a letter coming from cannada might be
    dedteced, but if you will writ to soume one that you know, and
    gait them to see Mr Samual Maden he will give all the
    information that you want, as he is acquanted with my wife, he
    is a preacher and belongs to the Baptis church. My wifes name is
    Winne Ann Berrell, and she is oned by one Dr. Tarns who is on a
    viset to Baltimore, now Mr Still will you attend to this thing
    for me, fourthwith, if you will I will pay you four your truble,
    if we can dow any thing it must be don now, as she will leave
    theare in the spring, and if you will take the matter in hand,
    you mous writ me on to reseption of this letter, whether you
    will or not.

    Yours truly,

    LEWIS BURRELL.

    No. 49 Victoria St., Toronto, C.W.


As in the case of many others, the way was so completely blocked that
nothing could be done for the wife's deliverance. Until the day when the
millions of fetters were broken, nothing gave so much pain to husbands
and wives as these heart-breaking separations.



William Williams and his wife were the next who arrived. They came from
Haven Manor, Md. They had been owned by John Peak, by whom, according to
their report, they had been badly treated, and the Committee had no
reason to doubt their testimony.



The next arrival numbered four passengers, and came under the guidance
of "Moses" (Harriet Tubman), from Maryland. They were adults, looking as
though they could take care of themselves very easily, although they had
the marks of Slavery on them. It was no easy matter for men and women
who had been ground down all their lives, to appear as though they had
been enjoying freedom. Indeed, the only wonder was that so many appeared
to as good advantage as they did, after having been crushed down so
long.

The paucity of the narratives in the month of April, is quite
noticeable. Why fuller reports were not written out, cannot now be
accounted for; probably the feeling existed that it was useless to write
out narratives, except in cases of very special interest.

FIVE FROM GEORGETOWN CROSS ROADS.


MOTHER AND CHILD FROM NORFOLK, VA., ETC.




ABE FINEER, SAM DAVIS, HENRY SAUNDERS, WM. HENRY THOMPSON and THOMAS
PARKER arrived safely from the above named place. Upon inquiry, the
following information was gleaned from them.



Abe spoke with feelings of some bitterness of a farmer known by the name
of George Spencer, who had deprived him of the hard earnings of his
hands. Furthermore, he had worked him hard, stinted him for food and
clothing and had been in the habit of flogging him whenever he felt like
it. In addition to the above charges, Abe did not hesitate to say that
his master meddled too much with the bottle, in consequence of which, he
was often in a "top-heavy" state. Abe said, however, that he was rich
and stood pretty high in the neighborhood--stinting, flogging and
drinking were no great disadvantages to a man in Georgetown, Maryland.

Abe was twenty-three years of age, pure black, ordinary size, and
spirited, a thorough convert to the doctrine that all men are born free,
and although he had been held in bondage up to the hour of his escape,
he gave much reason for believing that he would not be an easy subject
to manage under the yoke, if ever captured and carried back.



Sam was about thirty years of age, genuine black, common size, and a
hater of slavery; he was prepared to show, by the scars he bore about
his person, why he talked as he did. Forever will he remember James
Hurst, his so-called master, who was a very blustering man oft-times,
and in the habit of abusing his slaves. Sam was led to seek the
Underground Rail Road, in order to get rid of his master and, at the
same time, to do better for himself than he could possibly do in
Slavery. He had to leave his wife, Phillis, and one child.



William Henry was about twenty-four years of age, and of a chestnut
color. He too talked of slave-holders, and his master in particular,
just as any man would talk who had been shamefully robbed and wronged
all his life.



Tom, likewise, told the same story, and although they used the
corn-field vernacular, they were in earnest and possessed an abundance
of mother-wit, so that their testimony was not to be made light of.

The following letter from Thomas Garrett speaks for itself:




    WILMINGTON, 5 mo. 11th, 1856.

    ESTEEMED FRIENDS--McKim and Still:--I purpose sending to-morrow
    morning by the steamboat a woman and child, whose husband, I
    think, went some nine months previous to New Bedford. She was
    furnished with a free passage by the same line her husband came
    in. She has been away from the person claiming to be her master
    some five months; we, therefore, think there cannot be much risk
    at present. Those four I wrote thee about arrived safe up in the
    neighborhood of Longwood, and Harriet Tubman followed after in
    the stage yesterday. I shall expect five more from the same
    neighborhood next trip. Captain Lambdin is desirous of having
    sent him a book, or books, with the strongest arguments of the
    noted men of the South against the institution of slavery, as he
    wishes to prepare to defend himself, as he has little confidence
    in his attorney. Cannot you send to me something that will be of
    benefit to him, or send it direct to him? Would not W. Goodell's
    book be of use? His friends here think there is no chance for
    him but to go to the penitentiary. They now refuse to let any
    one but his attorney see him.

    As ever your friend,

    THOS. GARRETT.


The woman and child alluded to were received and noted on the record
book as follows:

Winnie Patty, and her daughter, Elizabeth, arrived safely from Norfolk,
Va. The mother is about twenty-two years of age, good-looking and of
chestnut color, smart and brave. From the latter part of October, 1855,
to the latter part of March, 1856, this young slave mother, with her
child, was secreted under the floor of a house. The house was occupied
by a slave family, friends of Winnie. During the cold winter weather she
suffered severely from wet and cold, getting considerably frosted, but
her faith failed not, even in the hour of greatest extremity. She chose
rather to suffer thus than endure slavery any longer, especially as she
was aware that the auction-block awaited her. She had already been sold
three times; she knew therefore what it was to be sold.

Jacob Shuster was the name of the man whom she spoke of as her tormentor
and master, and from whom she fled. He had been engaged in the farming
business, and had owned quite a large number of slaves, but from time to
time he had been selling off, until he had reduced his stock
considerably.

Captain Lambdin, spoken of in Thomas Garrett's letter, had, in the
kindness of his heart, brought away in his schooner some Underground
Rail Road passengers, but unfortunately he was arrested and thrust into
prison in Norfolk, Va., to await trial. Having no confidence in his
attorney there he found that he would have to defend himself as best he
could, consequently he wanted books, etc. He was in the attitude of a
drowning man catching at a straw. The Committee was powerless to aid
him, except with some money; as the books that he desired had but little
effect in the lions' den, in which he was. He had his trial, and was
sent to the penitentiary, of course.

A man calling himself Alfred Homer, answering to the above description,
came to the Vigilance Committee in June, 1856. As a memorial we
transferred the advertisement of John W. Anderson to our record book,
and concluded to let that suffice. Alfred, however, gave a full
description of his master's character, and the motives which impelled
him to seek his freedom. He was listened to attentively, but his story
was not entered on the book.

PASSENGERS FROM MARYLAND, 1857.

WILLIAM HENRY MOODY, BELINDA BIVANS, ETC.




William was about twenty years of age, black, usual size, and a lover of
liberty. He had heard of Canada, had formed a very favorable opinion of
the country and was very desirous of seeing it. The man who had
habitually robbed him of his hire, was a "stout-built, ill-natured man,"
a farmer, by the name of William Hyson.

To meet the expenses of an extensive building enterprise which he had
undertaken, it was apparent that Hyson would have to sell some of his
property. William and some six others of the servants got wind of the
fact that they would stand a chance of being in the market soon. Not
relishing the idea of going further South they unanimously resolved to
emigrate to Canada. Accordingly they borrowed a horse from Dr. Wise, and
another from H.K. Tice, and a carriage from F.J. Posey, and Joseph P.
Mong's buggy (so it was stated in the Baltimore Sun, of May 27th), and
off they started for the promised land. The horses and carriages were
all captured at Chambersburg, a day or two after they set out, but the
rest of the property hurried on to the Committee. How Mr. Hyson raised
the money to carry out his enterprise, William and his "ungrateful"
fellow-servants seemed not to be concerned.



Belinda Bivans. Belinda was a large woman, thirty years of age, wholly
black, and fled from Mr. Hyson, in company with William, and those above
referred to, with the idea of reaching Canada, whither her father had
fled eight years before.

She was evidently pleased with the idea of getting away from her
ill-natured mistress, from poor fare and hard work without pay. She had
experienced much hardship, and had become weary of her trial in bondage.
She had been married, but her husband had died, leaving her with two
little girls to care for, both of whom she succeeded in bringing away
with her.

In reference to the church relations of her master and mistress, she
represented the former as a backslider, and added that money was his
church; of the latter she said, "she would go and take the sacrament,
come back and the old boy would be in her as big as a horse." Belinda
could see but little difference between her master and mistress.

Joseph Winston. In the Richmond Dispatch, of June 9th, the following
advertisement was found:

    $500 if taken out of the state.

    Run away, my negro boy JOE, sometimes called JOE WINSTON; about
    23 years old, a little over 5 feet high, rather stout-built,
    dark ginger-bread color, small moustache, stammers badly when
    confused or spoken to, took along two or three suits of clothes,
    one a blue dress coat with brass buttons, black pants, and
    patent leather shoes, white hat, silver watch with gold chain;
    was last seen in this city on Tuesday last, had a pass to
    Hanover county, and supposed to be making his way towards York
    River, for the purpose of getting on board some coasting vessel.

    SAMUEL ELLIS.


The passenger above described reached the Underground Rail Road station,
June 6th, 1857.

"Why did you leave your master?" said a member of the Committee to Joe.
"I left because there was no enjoyment in slavery for colored people."
After stating how the slaves were treated he added, "I was working all
the time for master and he was receiving all my money for my daily
labor." "What business did your master follow?" inquired the Committee.
"He was a carpenter by trade." "What kind of a looking man was he?"
again inquired the Committee. "He was a large, stout man, don't swear,
but lies and cheats." Joe admitted that he had been treated very well
all his life, with the exception of being deprived of his freedom. For
eight years prior to his escape he had been hired out, a part of the
time as porter in a grocery store, the remainder as bar-tender in a
saloon. At the time of his escape he was worth twenty-two dollars per
month to his master. Joe had to do overwork and thus procure clothing
for himself.

When a small boy he resolved, that he never would work all his days as a
slave for the white people. As he advanced in years his desire for
freedom increased. An offer of fifteen hundred dollars was made for Joe,
so he was informed a short time before he escaped; this caused him to
move promptly in the matter of carrying out his designs touching
liberty.

His parents and three brothers, slaves, were to be left; but when the
decisive hour came he was equal to the emergency. In company with
William Naylor secreted in a vessel, he was brought away and delivered
to the Committee for aid and counsel, which he received, and thus ended
his bondage. The reward offered by his master, Samuel Ellis, proved of
no avail.

ARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND.


William Scott. William was about twenty-four years of age, well made,
though not very heavy--stammered considerably when speaking--wide awake
and sensible nevertheless. For two years the fear of being sold had not
been out of his mind. To meet a security agreement, which had been
contracted by his mistress--about which a law-suit had been pending for
two years--was what he feared he should be sold for. About the first of
May he found himself in the hands of the sheriff. On being taken to
Stafford Court-House Jail, however, the sheriff permitted him to walk a
"little ways." It occurred to William that then was his only chance to
strike for freedom and Canada, at all hazards. He soon decided the
matter, and the sheriff saw no more of him.

Susan Fox was the name of the person he was compelled to call mistress.
She was described as a "large, portly woman, very gross, with a
tolerably severe temper, at times." William's mother and one of his
brothers had been sold by this woman--an outrage to be forever
remembered. His grandmother, one sister, with two children, and a cousin
with five children, all attached by the sheriff, for sale, were left in
the hands of his mistress. He was married the previous Christmas, but in
the trying hour could do nothing for his wife, but leave her to the
mercy of slave-holders. The name of the sheriff that he outgeneralled
was Walter Cox. William was valued at $1,000.

Perhaps, after all, but few appreciated the sorrow that must have filled
the hearts of most of those who escaped. Though they succeeded in
gaining their own liberty--they were not insensible to the oppression of
their friends and relatives left in bondage. On reaching Canada and
tasting the sweets of freedom, the thought of dear friends in bondage
must have been acutely painful.

William had many perils to encounter. On one occasion he was hotly
chased, but proved too fleet-footed for his pursuers. At another time,
when straitened, he attempted to swim a river, but failed. His faith
remained strong, nevertheless, and he succeeded in reaching the
Committee.

ARRIVAL FROM WASHINGTON, D.C., etc., 1857.

GEORGE CARROLL, RANDOLPH BRANSON, JOHN CLAGART, AND WILLIAM ROYAN.


These four journeyed from "Egypt" together--but did not leave the same
"kind protector."



George was a full black, ordinary size, twenty-four years of age, and a
convert to the doctrine that he had a right to himself. For years the
idea of escape had been daily cherished. Five times he had proposed to
buy himself, but failed to get the consent of his "master," who was a
merchant, C.C. Hirara, a man about sixty years of age, and a member of
the Methodist Church. His property in slaves consisted of two men, two
women, two girls and a boy.

Three of George's brothers escaped to Canada many years prior to his
leaving--there he hoped on his arrival to find them in the possession of
good farms. $1,300 walked off in the person of George.



Randolph, physically, was a superior man. He was thirty-one years of age
and of a dark chestnut color. Weary with bondage he came to the
conclusion that he had served a master long enough "without privileges."
Against his master, Richard Reed, he had no hard things to say, however.
He was not a "crabbed, cross man"--had but "little to say," but "didn't
believe in freedom."

Three of his brothers had been sold South. Left his father, two sisters
and one brother. Randolph was worth probably $1,700.



John was a well-made yellow man, twenty-two years of age, who had
counted the cost of slavery thoroughly, besides having experienced the
effects of it. Accordingly he resolved to "be free or die," "to kill or
be killed, in trying to reach free land somewhere!"

Having "always been hired out amongst very hard white people," he was
"unhappy." His owner, George Coleman, lived near Fairfax, Va., and was a
member of the Methodist Church, but in his ways was "very sly," and
"deadly against anything like Freedom." He held fifteen of his
fellow-men in chains.

For John's hire he received one hundred and fifty dollars a year. He
was, therefore, ranked with first-class "stock," valued at $1,500.



William was about thirty-five years of age, neat, and pleasing in his
manners. He would be the first selected in a crowd by a gentleman or a
lady, who might want a very neat-looking man to attend to household
affairs. Though he considered Captain Cunningham, his master, a
"tolerable fair man," he was not content to be robbed of his liberty and
earnings. As he felt that he "could take care of himself," he decided to
let the Captain have the same chance--and so he steered his course
straight for Canada.

ARRIVAL FROM UNIONVILLE, 1857.

ISRAEL TODD, AND BAZIL ALDRIDGE.




Israel was twenty-three years of age, yellow, tall, well made and
intelligent. He fled from Frederick county, Md. Through the sweat of his
brow, Dr. Greenberry Sappington and his family had been living at ease.
The doctor was a Catholic, owning only one other, and was said to be a
man of "right disposition." His wife, however, was "so mean that nobody
could stay with her." Israel was prompted to escape to save his wife,
(had lately been married) and her brother from being sold south. His
detestation of slavery in every shape was very decided. He was a
valuable man, worth to a trader fifteen hundred dollars, perhaps.



Bazil was only seventeen years of age. About as near a kin to the "white
folks" as to the colored people, and about as strong an opponent of
slavery as any "Saxon" going of his age. He was a brother-in-law of
Israel, and accompanied him on the Underground Rail Road. Bazil was held
to service or labor by Thornton Pool, a store-keeper, and also farmer,
and at the same time an ardent lover of the "cretur," so much so that
"he kept about half-drunk all the time." So Bazil affirmed. The good
spirit moved two of Bazil's brothers to escape the spring before. A few
months afterwards a brother and sister were sold south. To manage the
matter smoothly, previous to selling them, the master pretended that he
was "only going to hire them out a short distance from home." But
instead of doing so he sold them south. Bazil might be put down at nine
hundred dollars.

ARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, 1857.

ORDEE LEE, AND RICHARD J. BOOCE.




Both of these passengers came from Maryland. Ordee was about thirty-five
years of age, gingerbread color, well made, and intelligent. Being
allowed no chances to make anything for himself, was the excuse offered
for his escape. Though, as will appear presently, other causes also
helped to make him hate his oppression.

The man who had daily robbed him, and compelled him to call him master,
was a notorious "gambler," by the name of Elijah Thompson, residing in
Maryland. "By his bad habits he had run through with his property,
though in society he stood pretty tolerably high amongst some people;
then again some didn't like him, he was a mean man, all for himself. He
was a man that didn't care anything about his servants, except to get
work out of them. When he came where the servants were working, he would
snap and bite at them and if he said anything at all, it was to hurry
the work on."

"He never gave me," said Ordee, "a half a dollar in his life. Didn't
more than half feed, said that meat and fish was too high to eat. As for
clothing, he never gave me a new hat for every day, nor a Sunday rag in
his life." Of his mistress, he said, "She was stingy and close,--made
him (his master) worse than what he would have been." Two of his
brothers were sold to Georgia, and his uncle was cheated out of his
freedom. Left three brothers and two sisters in chains. Elijah Thompson
had at least fifteen hundred dollars less to sport upon by this bold
step on the part of Ordee.



Richard was about twenty-two years of age, well grown, and a very
likely-looking article, of a chestnut color, with more than common
intelligence for a slave.

His complaints were that he had been treated "bad," allowed "no
privileges" to make anything, allowed "no Sunday clothing," &c. So he
left the portly-looking Dr. Hughes, with no feeling of indebtedness or
regret. And as to his "cross and ill-natured" mistress, with her four
children, they might whistle for his services and support. His master
had, however, some eighteen or twenty others to rob for the support of
himself and family, so they were in no great danger of starving.

"Would your owner be apt to pursue you?" said a member of the Committee.
"I don't think he will. He was after two uncles of mine, one time, saw
them, and talked with them, but was made to run."

Richard left behind his mother, step-father, two sisters, and one
brother. As a slave, he would have been considered cheap at sixteen
hundred dollars. He was a fine specimen.

ARRIVAL FROM CAMBRIDGE, 1857.




Silas Long and Solomon Light. Silas and Solomon both left together from
Cambridge, Md.

Silas was quite black, spare-built and about twenty-seven years of age.
He was owned by Sheriff Robert Bell, a man about "sixty years of age,
and had his name up to be the hardest man in the county." "The Sheriff's
wife was about pretty much such a woman as he was a man--there was not a
pin's point of difference between them." The fear of having to be sold
caused this Silas to seek the Underground Rail Road. Leaving his mother,
one brother and one cousin, and providing himself with a Bowie-knife and
a few dollars in money, he resolved to reach Canada, "or die on the
way." Of course, when slaves reached this desperate point, the way to
Canada was generally found.

Solomon was about twenty-three years of age, a good-natured-looking
"article," who also left Cambridge, and the protection of a certain
Willis Branick, described as an "unaccountable mean man." "He never gave
me any money in his life," said Sol., "but spent it pretty freely for
liquor." "He would not allow enough to eat, or clothing sufficient." And
he sold Sol.'s brother the year before he fled, "because he could not
whip him." The fear of being sold prompted Sol. to flee. The very day he
escaped he had a serious combat with two of his master's sons. The thumb
of one of them being "badly bit," and the other used roughly--the ire of
the master and sons was raised to a very high degree--and the verdict
went forth that "Sol. should be sold to-morrow." Unhesitatingly, he
started for the Underground Rail Road and Canada--and his efforts were
not in vain. Damages, $1,500.

"THE MOTHER OF TWELVE CHILDREN."


OLD JANE DAVIS--FLED TO ESCAPE THE AUCTION-BLOCK.


The appended letter, from Thomas Garrett, will serve to introduce one of
the most remarkable cases that it was our privilege to report or assist:


    WILMINGTON, 6 mo., 9th, 1857.

    ESTEEMED FRIEND--WILLIAM STILL:--We have here in this place, at
    Comegys Munson's an old colored woman, the mother of twelve
    children, one half of which has been sold South. She has been so
    ill used, that she was compelled to leave husband and children
    behind, and is desirous of getting to a brother who lives at
    Buffalo. She was nearly naked. She called at my house on 7th day
    night, but being from home, did not see her till last evening. I
    have procured her two under garments, one new; two skirts, one
    new; a good frock with cape; one of my wife's bonnets and
    stockings, and gave her five dollars in gold, which, if properly
    used, will put her pretty well on the way. I also gave her a
    letter to thee. Since I gave them to her she has concluded to
    stay where she is till 7th day night, when Comegys Munson says
    he can leave his work and will go with her to thy house. I write
    this so that thee may be prepared for them; they ought to arrive
    between 11 and 12 o'clock. Perhaps thee may find some fugitive
    that will be willing to accompany her. With desire for thy
    welfare and the cause of the oppressed, I remain thy friend,

    THOS. GARRETT.


Jane did not know how old she was. She was probably sixty or seventy.
She fled to keep from being sold. She had been "whipt right smart,"
poorly fed and poorly clothed, by a certain Roger McZant, of the New
Market District, Eastern Shore of Maryland. His wife was a "bad woman
too." Just before escaping, Jane got a whisper that her "master" was
about to sell her; on asking him if the rumor was true, he was silent.
He had been asking "one hundred dollars" for her.

Remembering that four of her children had been snatched away from her
and sold South, and she herself was threatened with the same fate, she
was willing to suffer hunger, sleep in the woods for nights and days,
wandering towards Canada, rather than trust herself any longer under the
protection of her "kind" owner. Before reaching a place of repose she
was _three weeks in the woods_, almost wholly without nourishment.

Jane, doubtless, represented thousands of old slave mothers, who, after
having been worn out under the yoke, were frequently either offered for
sale for a trifle, turned off to die, or compelled to eke out their
existence on the most stinted allowance.

BENJAMIN ROSS, AND HIS WIFE HARRIET.


FLED FROM CAROLINE COUNTY, EASTERN SHORE OF MARYLAND, JUNE, 1857.


This party stated that Dr. Anthony Thompson had claimed them as his
property. They gave the Committee a pretty full report of how they had
been treated in slavery, especially under the doctor. A few of the
interesting points were noted as follows: The doctor owned about twenty
head of slaves when they left; formerly he had owned a much larger
number, but circumstances had led him to make frequent sales during the
few years previous to their escape, by which the stock had been reduced.
As well as having been largely interested in slaves, he had at the same
time been largely interested in real estate, to the extent of a dozen
farms at least. But in consequence of having reached out too far,
several of his farms had slipped out of his hands.

Upon the whole, Benjamin pronounced him a rough man towards his slaves,
and declared, that he had not given him a dollar since the death of his
(the master's) father, which had been at least twenty years prior to
Benjamin's escape. But Ben. did not stop here, he went on to speak of
the religious character of his master, and also to describe him
physically; he was a Methodist preacher, and had been "pretending to
preach for twenty years." Then the fact that a portion of their children
had been sold to Georgia by this master was referred to with much
feeling by Ben and his wife; likewise the fact that he had stinted them
for food and clothing, and led them a rough life generally, which left
them no room to believe that he was anything else than "a wolf in
sheep's clothing." They described him as a "spare-built man, bald head,
wearing a wig."

These two travelers had nearly reached their three score years and ten
under the yoke. Nevertheless they seemed delighted at the idea of going
to a free country to enjoy freedom, if only for a short time. Moreover
some of their children had escaped in days past, and these they hoped to
find. Not many of those thus advanced in years ever succeeded in getting
to Canada.

ARRIVAL FROM VIRGINIA, 1857.


WILLIAM JACKSON.


William was about fifty years of age, of usual size, of good address,
and intelligent. He was born the property of a slaveholder, by the name
of Daniel Minne, residing in Alexandria in Virginia. His master was
about eighty-four years of age, and was regarded as kind, though he had
sold some of his slaves and was in favor of slavery. He had two sons,
Robert and Albert, "both dissipated, would layabout the tippling
taverns, and keep low company, so much so that they were not calculated
to do any business for their father." William had to be a kind of a
right hand man to his master. The sons seeing that the "property" was
trusted instead of themselves, very naturally hated it, so the young men
resolved that at the death of their father, William should be sent as
far south as possible. Knowing that the old man could not stand it much
longer, William saw that it was his policy to get away as fast as he
could. He was the husband of a free wife, who had come on in advance of
him.

For thirty years William had been foreman on his old master's
plantation, and but for the apprehension caused by the ill-will of his
prospective young masters, he would doubtless have remained in servitude
at least until the death of the old man. But when William reflected, and
saw what he had been deprived of all his life by being held in bondage,
and when he began to breathe free air, with the prospect of ending his
days on free land, he rejoiced that his eyes had been opened to see his
danger, and that he had been moved to make a start for liberty.

ARRIVAL FROM DELAWARE, 1857.

JOHN WRIGHT AND WIFE, ELIZABETH ANN, AND CHARLES CONNOR.




This party arrived from Sussex county. John was about thirty years of
age, ordinary size, full black and clear-headed. In physical appearance
he would have readily passed for a superior laborer. The keenness of his
eyes and quickness of his perception, however, would doubtless have
rendered him an object of suspicion in some parts of the South. The
truth was that the love of liberty was clearly indicated in his
expressive countenance. William S. Phillips, a farmer, had been
"sucking" John's blood, and keeping him poor and ignorant for the last
eight years at least; before that, Phillips' father had defrauded him of
his hire.

Under the father and son John had found plenty of hard work and bad
usage, severe and repeated floggings not excepted. Old master and
mistress and young master and mistress, including the entire family,
belonged to what was known as the "Farmer church," at Portsville.
Outwardly they were good Christians. "Occasionally," John said, "the old
man would have family prayers," and to use John's own words, "in company
he would try to moralize, but out of company was as great a rowdy as
ever was." In further describing his old master, he said that he was a
large man, with a red face and blunt nose, and was very quick and fiery
in his temper; would drink and swear--and even his wife, with all hands,
would have to run when he was "raised."

Of his young master he said: "He was quite a long-bodied, thin-faced
man, weighing over one hundred and fifty pounds. In temper just like his
father, though he did not drink--that is all the good quality that I can
recommend in him." John said also that his master, on one occasion, in a
most terribly angry mood, threatened that he would "wade up to his knees
in his (John's) blood." It so happened that John's blood was up pretty
high just at that time; he gave his master to understand that he would
rather go South (be sold) than submit to the scourging which was
imminent. John's pluck probably had the effect of allaying the master's
fire; at any rate the storm subsided after awhile, and until the day
that he took the Underground Rail Road car the servant managed to put up
with his master. As John's wife was on the eve of being sold he was
prompted to leave some time sooner than he otherwise would have done.



THE WIFE'S STATEMENT


She was thirty-two years of age, of good physical proportions, and a
promising-looking person, above the ordinary class of slaves belonging
to Delaware. She was owned by Jane Cooper, who lived near Laurel, in
Sussex county. She had been more accustomed to field labor than
house-work; ploughing, fencing, driving team, grubbing, cutting wood,
etc., were well understood by her. During "feeding times" she had to
assist in the house. In this respect, she had harder times than the men.
Her mistress was also in the habit of hiring Elizabeth out by the day to
wash. On these occasions she was required to rise early enough to milk
the cows, get breakfast, and feed the hogs before sunrise, so that she
might be at her day's washing in good time.

It is plainly to be seen, that Elizabeth had not met with the "ease" and
kindness which many claimed for the slave. Elizabeth was sensible of the
wrongs inflicted by her Delaware mistress, and painted her in very vivid
colors. Her mistress was a widow, "quite old," but "very frisky," and
"wore a wig to hide her gray hairs." At the death of her husband, the
slaves believed, from what they had heard their master say, that they
would be freed, each at the age of thirty. But no will was found, which
caused Elizabeth, as well as the rest of the slaves, to distrust the
mistress more than ever, as they suspected that she knew something of
its disappearance.

Her mistress belonged to the Presbyterian Church, but would have "family
prayers only when the minister would stop;" Elizabeth thought that she
took greater pains to please the minister than her Maker. Elizabeth had
no faith in such religion.

Both Elizabeth and her husband were members of the Methodist Church.
Neither had ever been permitted to learn to read or write, but they were
naturally very smart. John left his mother and one sister in bondage.
One of his brothers fled to Canada fifteen years before their escape.
His name was Abraham.



Charles Connor, the third person in the party, was twenty-seven years of
age--fast color, and a tough-looking "article," who would have brought
twelve hundred dollars or more in the hands of a Baltimore trader. The
man from whom Charles fled was known by the name of John Chipman, and
was described as "a fleshy man, with rank beard and quick temper, very
hard--commonly kept full of liquor, though he would not get so drunk
that he could not go about." For a long time Charles had been the main
dependence on his master's place, as he only owned two other slaves.
Charles particularly remarked, that no weather was too bad for them to
be kept at work in the field. Charles was a fair specimen of the
"corn-field hand," but thought that he could take care of himself in
Canada.

ARRIVAL FROM ALEXANDRIA, 1857.


OSCAR D. BALL, AND MONTGOMERY GRAHAM.



    FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS REWARD.--Ran away from the owner in
    Alexandria, Va., on the night of the 13th inst., two young negro
    men, from twenty to twenty-five years of age. MONTGOMERY is a
    very bright mulatto, about five feet, six inches in height, of
    polite manners, and smiles much when speaking or spoken to.
    OSCAR is of a tawny complexion, about six feet high, sluggish in
    his appearance and movements, and of awkward manners. One
    hundred dollars each will be paid for the delivery of the above
    slaves if taken in a slave state, or two hundred dollars each if
    taken in a free state. One or more slaves belonging to other
    owners, it is supposed, went in their company.

    Address:  JOHN T. GORDON,

    Alexandria, Va.

    [Illustration: ]


Although the name of John T. Gordon appears signed to the above
advertisement, he was not the owner of Montgomery and Oscar. According
to their own testimony they belonged to a maiden lady, by the name of
Miss Elizabeth Gordon, who probably thought that the business of
advertising for runaway negroes was rather beneath her.

While both these passengers manifested great satisfaction in leaving
their mistress they did not give her a bad name. On the contrary they
gave her just such a character as the lady might have been pleased with
in the main. They described her thus: "Mistress was a spare woman,
tolerably tall, and very kind, except when sick, she would not pay much
attention then. She was a member of the Southern Methodist Church, and
was strict in her religion."

Having a good degree of faith in his mistress, Oscar made bold one day
to ask her how much she would take for him. She agreed to take eight
hundred dollars. Oscar wishing to drive a pretty close bargain offered
her seven hundred dollars, hoping that she would view the matter in a
religious light, and would come down one hundred dollars. After
reflection instead of making a reduction, she raised the amount to one
thousand dollars, which Oscar concluded was too much for himself. It was
not, however, as much as he was worth according to his mistress'
estimate, for she declared that she had often been offered fifteen
hundred dollars for him. Miss Gordon raised Oscar from a child and had
treated him as a pet. When he was a little "shaver" seven or eight years
of age, she made it a practice to have him sleep with her, showing that
she had no prejudice.

Being rather of a rare type of slave-holders she is entitled to special
credit. Montgomery the companion of Oscar could scarcely be
distinguished from the white folks. In speaking of his mistress,
however, he did not express himself in terms quite so complimentary as
Oscar. With regard to giving "passes," he considered her narrow, to say
the least. But he was in such perfectly good humor with everybody, owing
to the fact that he had succeeded in getting his neck out of the yoke,
that he evidently had no desire to say hard things about her.

Judging from his story he had been for a long time desiring his freedom
and looking diligently for the Underground Rail Road, but he had had
many things to contend with when looking the matter of escape in the
face. Arriving in Philadelphia, and finding himself breathing free air,
receiving aid and encouragement in a manner that he had never known
before, he was one of the happiest of creatures.

Oscar left his wife and one child, one brother and two sisters.
Montgomery left one sister, but no other near kin.

Instead of going to Canada, Oscar and his comrade pitched their tents in
Oswego, N.Y., where they changed their names, and instead of returning
themselves to their kind mistress they were wicked enough to be plotting
as to how some of their friends might get off on the Underground Rail
Road, as may be seen from the appended letters from Oscar, who was
thought to be sluggish, etc.

ARRIVAL FROM UNIONVILLE, 1857.

CAROLINE ALDRIDGE AND JOHN WOOD.




Caroline was a stout, light-complexioned, healthy-looking young woman of
twenty-three years of age. She fled from Thornton Poole, of Unionville,
Md. She gave her master the character of being a "very mean man; with a
wife meaner still," "I consider them mean in every respect," said
Caroline. No great while before she escaped, one of her brothers and a
sister had been sent to the Southern market. Recently she had been
apprized that herself and a younger brother would have to go the same
dreadful road. She therefore consulted with the brother and a particular
young friend, to whom she was "engaged," which resulted in the departure
of all three of them. Though the ordinary steps relative to marriage, as
far as slaves were allowed, had been complied with, nevertheless on the
road to Canada, they availed themselves of the more perfect way of
having the ceremony performed, and went on their way rejoicing.

Since the sale of Caroline's brother and sister, just referred to, her
mother and three children had made good their exit to Canada, having
been evidently prompted by said sale. Long before that time, however,
three other brothers fled on the Underground Rail Road. They were
encouraged to hope to meet each other in Canada.



JOHN WOOD. John was about twenty-eight years of age, of agreeable
manners, intelligent, and gave evidence of a strong appreciation of
liberty. Times with John had "not been very rough," until within the
last year of his bondage. By the removal of his old master by death, a
change for the worse followed. The executors of the estate--one of whom
owed him an old grudge--made him acquainted with the fact, that amongst
certain others, he would have to be sold. Judge Birch (one of the
executors), "itching" to see him "broke in," "took particular pains" to
speak to a notorious tyrant by the name of Boldin, to buy him.
Accordingly on the day of sale, Boldin was on hand and the successful
bidder for John. Being familiar with, the customs of this terrible
Boldin,--of the starving fare and cruel flogging usual on his farm, John
mustered courage to declare at the sale, that he "_would not serve
him_." In the hearing of his new master, he said, "_before I will serve
him I will_ CUT _my throat_!" The master smiled, and simply asked for a
rope; "had me tied and delivered into the hands of a constable," to be
sent over to the farm. Before reaching his destination, John managed to
untie his hands and feet and flee to the woods. For three days he
remained secreted. Once or twice he secretly managed to get an interview
with his mother and one of his sisters, by whom he was persuaded to
return to his master. Taking their advice, he commenced service under
circumstances, compared with which, the diet, labor and comforts of an
ordinary penitentiary would have been luxurious. The chief food allowed
the slaves on the plantation consisted of the pot liquor in which the
pork was boiled, with Indian-meal bread. The merest glance at what he
experienced during his brief stay on the plantation must suffice. In the
field where John, with a number of others was working, stood a hill, up
which they were repeatedly obliged to ascend, with loads on their backs,
and the overseer at their heels, with lash in hand, occasionally
slashing at first one and then another; to keep up, the utmost physical
endurance was taxed. John, though a stout young man, and having never
known any other condition than that of servitude, nevertheless found
himself quite unequal to the present occasion. "I was surprised," said
he, "to see the expertness with which all flew up the hill." "_One
woman, quite_ LUSTY, _unfit to be out of the house, on_ RUNNING UP THE
HILL, fell; in a moment she was up again with her brush on her back, and
an hour afterwards the overseer was whipping her." "My turn came." "What
is the reason you can't get up the hill faster?" exclaimed the overseer,
at the same time he struck me with a cowhide. "I told him I would not
stand it." "Old Uncle George Washington never failed to get a whipping
every day."

So after serving at this only a few days, John made his last solemn vow
to be free or die; and off he started for Canada. Though he had to
contend with countless difficulties he at last made the desired haven.
He hailed from one of the lower counties of Maryland.

John was not contented to enjoy the boon alone, but like a true lover of
freedom he remembered those in bonds as bound with them, and so was
scheming to make a hazardous "adventure" South, on the express errand of
delivering his "family," as the subjoined letter will show:


    GLANDFORD, August 15th, 1858.

    DEAR SIR:--I received your letter and was glad to hear that your
    wife and family was all well and I hope it will continue so. I
    am glad to inform you that this leaves me well. Also, Mr. Wm.
    Still, I want for you to send me your opinion respecting my
    circumstances. I have made up my mind to make an adventure after
    my family and I want to get an answer from you and then I shall
    know how to act and then I will send to you all particulars
    respecting my starting to come to your house. Mr. Still I should
    be glad to know whare Abraham Harris is, as I should be as glad
    to see him as well as any of my own brothers. His wife and my
    wife's mother is sisters. My wife belongs to Elson Burdel's
    estate. Abraham's wife belongs to Sam Adams. Mr. Still you must
    not think hard of me for writing you these few lines as I cannot
    rest until I release my dear family. I have not the least doubt
    but I can get through without the least trouble. So no more at
    present from your humble servant,

    JOHN B. WOODS.

ARRIVAL FROM NEW ORLEANS, 1857.


JAMES CONNER, SHOT IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY.


James stated to the Committee that he was about forty-three years of
age, that he was born a slave in Nelson county, Ky., and that he was
first owned by a widow lady by the name of Ruth Head. "She (mistress)
was like a mother to me," said Jim. "I was about sixteen years old when
she died; the estate was settled and I was sold South to a man named
Vincent Turner, a planter, and about the worst man, I expect, that ever
the sun shined on. His slaves he fairly murdered; two hundred lashes
were merely a promise for him. He owned about three hundred slaves. I
lived with Turner until he died. After his death I still lived on the
plantation with his widow, Mrs. Virginia Turner." About twelve years ago
(prior to Jim's escape) she was married to a Mr. Charles Parlange, "a
poor man, though a very smart man, bad-hearted, and very barbarous."

Before her second marriage cotton had always been cultivated, but a few
years later sugar had taken the place of cotton, and had become the
principal thing raised in that part of the country. Under the change
sugar was raised and the slaves were made to experience harder times
than ever; they were allowed to have only from three to three and a half
pounds of pork a week, with a peck of meal; nothing else was allowed.
They commenced work in the morning, just when they could barely see;
they quit work in the evening when they could not see to work longer.

Mistress was a large, portly woman, good-looking, and pretty well liked
by her slaves. The place where the plantation was located was at Point
Copee, on Falls River, about one hundred and fifty miles from New
Orleans. She also owned property and about twenty slaves in the city of
New Orleans.

"I lived there and hired my time for awhile. I saw some hard times on
the plantation. Many a time I have seen slaves whipped almost to
death--well, I tell you I have seen them whipped to death. A slave named
Sam was whipped to death tied to the ground. Joe, another slave, was
whipped to death by the overseer: running away was the crime.

"Four times I was shot. Once, before I would be taken, all hands, young
and old on the plantation were on the chase after me. I was strongly
armed with an axe, tomahawk, and butcher knife. I expected to be killed
on the spot, but I got to the woods and stayed two days. At night I went
back to the plantation and got something to eat. While going back to the
woods I was shot in the thigh, legs, back and head, was badly wounded,
my mind was to die rather than be taken. I ran a half mile after I was
shot, but was taken. I have shot in me now. Feel here on my head, feel
my back, feel buck shot in my thigh. I shall carry shot in me to my
grave. I have been shot four different times. I was shot twice by a
fellow servant; it was my master's orders. Another time by the overseer.
Shooting was no uncommon thing in Louisiana. At one time I was allowed
to raise hogs. I had twenty-five taken from me without being allowed the
first copper.

"My mistress promised me at another time forty dollars for gathering
honey, but when I went to her, she said, by and by, but the by and by
never came. In 1853 my freedom was promised; for five years before this
time I had been overseer; during four years of this time a visit was
made to France by my owners, but on their return my freedom was not
given me. My mistress thought I had made enough money to buy myself.
They asked eleven hundred and fifty dollars for me. I told them that I
hadn't the money. Then they said if I would go with them to Virginia
after a number of slaves they wished to purchase, and would be a good
boy, they would give me my freedom on the return of the trip. We started
on the 8th of June, 1857. I made fair promises wishing to travel, and
they placed all confidence in me. I was to carry the slaves back from
Virginia.

"They came as far as Baltimore, and they began to talk of coming farther
North, to Philadelphia. They talked very good to me, and told me that if
they brought me with them to a free State that I must not leave them;
talked a good deal about giving me my freedom, as had been promised
before starting, etc. I let on to them that I had no wish to go North;
that Baltimore was as far North as I wished to see, and that I had
rather be going home than going North. I told them that I was tired of
this country. In speaking of coming North, they made mention of the
Alleghany mountains. I told them that I would like to see that, but
nothing more. They hated the North, and I made believe that I did too.
Mistress said, that if I behaved myself I could go with them to France,
when they went again, after they returned home--as they intended to go
again.

"So they decided to take me with them to Philadelphia, for a short
visit, before going into Virginia to buy up their drove of slaves for
Louisiana. My heart leaped for joy when I found we were going to a free
State; but I did not let my owners know my feelings.

"We reached Philadelphia and went to the Girard Hotel, and there I made
up my mind that they should go back without me. I saw a colored man who
talked with me, and told me about the Committee. He brought me to the
anti-slavery office," etc., etc., etc.

The Committee told Jim that he could go free immediately, without saying
a word to anybody, as the simple fact of his master's bringing him into
the State was sufficient to establish his freedom before the Courts. At
the same time the Committee assured him if he were willing to have his
master arrested and brought before one of the Judges of the city to show
cause why he held him a slave in Pennsylvania, contrary to the laws of
the State, that he should lack neither friends nor money to aid him in
the matter; and, moreover, his freedom would be publicly proclaimed.

Jim thought well of both ways, but preferred not to meet his
"kind-hearted" master and mistress in Court, as he was not quite sure
that he would have the courage to face them and stand by his charges.

This was not strange. Indeed not only slaves cowed before the eye of
slave-holders. Did not even Northern men, superior in education and
wealth, fear to say their souls were their own in the same presence?

Jim, therefore, concluded to throw himself upon the protection of the
Committee and take an Underground Rail Road ticket, and thereby spare
himself and his master and mistress the disagreeableness of meeting
under such strange circumstances. The Committee arranged matters for him
to the satisfaction of all concerned, and gave him a passport for her
British majesty's possession, Canada.

The unvarnished facts, as they were then recorded substantially from the
lips of Jim, and as they are here reproduced, comprise only a very
meagre part of his sadly interesting story. At the time Jim left his
master and mistress so unceremoniously in Philadelphia, some excitement
existed at the attempt of his master to recover him through the Police
of Philadelphia, under the charge that he (Jim) had been stealing, as
may be seen from the following letter which appeared in the "National
Anti-Slavery Standard:"



ANOTHER SLAVE HUNT IN PHILADELPHIA.



    _Philadelphia, Monday, July_ 27, 1857.

    Yesterday afternoon a rumor was afloat that a negro man named
    Jim, who had accompanied his master (Mr. Charles Parlange), from
    New Orleans to this city, had left his master for the purpose of
    tasting the sweets of freedom. It was alleged by Mr. Parlange
    that the said "Jim" had taken with him two tin boxes, one of
    which contained money. Mr. Parlange went, on his way to New
    York, _viâ_ the Camden and Amboy Railroad, and upon his arrival
    at the Walnut street wharf, with two ladies, "Jim" was missing.
    Mr. Parlange immediately made application to a Mr. Wallace, who
    is a Police officer stationed at the Walnut street depot. Mr.
    Wallace got into a carriage with Mr. Parlange and the two
    ladies, and, as Mr. Wallace stated, drove back to the Girard
    House, where "Jim" had not been heard of since he had left for
    the Walnut street wharf.

    A story was then set afloat to the effect, that a negro of
    certain, but very particular description (such as a Louisiana
    nigger-driver only can give), had stolen two boxes as stated
    above. A notice signed "Clarke," was received at the Police
    Telegraph Office by the operator (David Wunderly) containing a
    full description of Jim, also offering a reward of $100 for his
    capture. This notice was telegraphed to all the wards in every
    section. This morning Mr. Wunderly found fault with the
    reporters using the information, and, in presence of some four
    or five persons, said the notice signed "Clarke," was a private
    paper, and no reporter had a right to look at it; at the same
    time asserting, that if he knew where the nigger was he would
    give him up, as $100 did not come along every day. The
    policeman, Wallace, expressed the utmost fear lest the name of
    Mr. Parlange should transpire, and stated, that he was an
    intimate friend of his. It does not seem that the matter was
    communicated to the wards by any official authority whatever,
    and who the "Clarke" is, whose name was signed to the notice,
    has not yet transpired. Some of the papers noticed it briefly
    this morning, which has set several of the officers on their
    tips. There is little doubt, that "Jim" has merely exercised his
    own judgment about remaining with his master any longer, and
    took this opportunity to betake himself to freedom. It is
    assumed, that he was to precede his master to Walnut street
    wharf with the baggage; but, singular enough to say, no
    complaint has been made about the baggage being missed, simply
    the two tin boxes, and particularly the one containing money.
    This is, doubtless, a ruse to engage the services of the
    Philadelphia police in the interesting game of nigger hunting.
    Mr. Parlange, if he is sojourning in your city, will doubtless
    be glad to learn that the matter of his man "Jim" and the two
    tin boxes has received ample publicity. W.H.

    MY DEAR FRIEND--WM. STILL:--I take the liberty to inform you,
    that I had the pleasure of seeing a man of sable brand at my
    house in St. C. yesterday, by name of James Connor, lately from
    New Orleans, more recently from the city of Brotherly love,
    where he took French leave of his French master. He desired me
    to inform you of his safe arrival in the glorious land of
    Freedom, and to send his kind regards to you and to Mr.
    Williamson; also to another person, (the name I have forgotten).
    Poor Malinda Smith, with her two little girls and young babe is

ARRIVAL FROM WASHINGTON, D.C.


HARRISON CARY.


The passenger bearing this name who applied to the Committee for
assistance, was a mulatto of medium size, with a prepossessing
countenance, and a very smart talker. With only a moderate education he
might have raised himself to the "top round of the ladder," as a
representative of the down-trodden slave. Seeking, as usual, to learn
his history, the subjoined questions and answers were the result of the
interview:


    Q. "How old are you?"

    A. "Twenty-eight years of age this coming March."

    Q. "To whom did you belong?"

    A. "Mrs. Jane E. Ashley."

    Q. "What kind of a woman was she?"

    A. "She was a very clever woman; never said anything out of the
    way."

    Q. "How many servants had she?"

    A. "She had no other servants."

    Q. "Did you live with her?"

    A. "No. I hired my time for twenty-two dollars a month."

    Q. "How could you make so much money?"

    A. "I was a bricklayer by trade, and ranked among the first in
    the city."


As Harrison talked so intelligently, the member of the Committee who was
examining him, was anxious to know how he came to be so knowing, the
fact that he could read being very evident.

Harrison proceeded to explain how he was led to acquire the art both of
reading and writing: "Slaves caught out of an evening without passes
from their master or mistress, were invariably arrested, and if they
were unable to raise money to buy themselves off, they were taken and
locked up in a place known as the 'cage,' and in the morning the owner
was notified, and after paying the fine the unfortunate prisoner had to
go to meet his fate at the hands of his owner."

Often he or she found himself or herself sentenced to take thirty-nine
or more lashes before atonement could be made for the violated law, and
the fine sustained by the enraged owner.

Harrison having strong aversion to both of the "wholesome regulations"
of the peculiar institution above alluded to, saw that the only remedy
that he could avail himself of was to learn to write his own passes. In
possessing himself of this prize he knew that the law against slaves
being taught, would have to be broken, nevertheless he was so anxious to
succeed, that he was determined to run the risk. Consequently he grasped
the boon with but very little difficulty or assistance. Valuing his
prize highly, he improved more and more until he could write his own
passes satisfactorily. The "cage" he denounced as a perfect "hog hole,"
and added, "it was more than I could bear."

He also spoke with equal warmth on the pass custom, "the idea of working
hard all day and then being obliged to have a pass," etc.,--his feelings
sternly revolted against. Yet he uttered not a disrespectful word
against the individual to whom he belonged. Once he had been sold, but
for what was not noted on the record book.

His mother had been sold several times. His brother, William Henry Gary,
escaped from Washington, D.C., when quite a youth. What became of him it
was not for Harrison to tell, but he supposed that he had made his way
to a free State, or Canada, and he hoped to find him. He had no
knowledge of any other relatives.

In further conversation with him, relative to his being a single man, he
said, that he had resolved not to entangle himself with a family until
he had obtained his freedom.

He had found it pretty hard to meet his monthly hire, consequently he
was on the look-out to better his condition as soon as a favorable
opportunity might offer. Harrison's mistress had a son named John James
Ashley, who was then a minor. On arriving at majority, according to the
will of this lad's father, he was to have possession of Harrison as his
portion. Harrison had no idea of having to work for his support--he
thought that, if John could not take care of himself when he grew up to
be a man, there was a place for all such in the poor-house.

Harrison was also moved by another consideration. His mistress' sister
had been trying to influence the mistress to sell him; thus considering
himself in danger, he made up his mind that the time had come for him to
change his habitation, so he resolved to try his fortune on the
Underground Rail Road.

ARRIVAL FROM VIRGINIA, 1857.


JOE ELLIS.


The subject of this sketch was one of two hundred slaves, owned by
Bolling Ellis, who possessed large plantations at Cabin Point, Surrey
Co., Va. Joe pictured his master, overseers, and general treatment of
slaves in no favorable light.

The practice of punishing slaves by putting them in the stocks and by
flogging, was dwelt upon in a manner that left no room to doubt but that
Joe had been a very great sufferer under his master's iron rule. As he
described the brutal conduct of overseers in resorting to their habitual
modes of torturing men, women, and children, it was too painful to
listen to with composure, much more to write down.

Joe was about twenty-three years of age, full black, slender, and of
average intellect, considering the class which he represented. On four
occasions previous to the final one he had made fruitless efforts to
escape from his tormentors in consequence of brutal treatment. Although
he at last succeeded, the severe trials through which he had to pass in
escaping, came very near costing him his life. The effects he will
always feel; prostration and sickness had already taken hold upon him in
a serious degree.

During Joe's sojourn under the care of the Committee, time would not
admit of the writing out of further details concerning him.

ARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND.


CHRISTOPHER GREEN AND WIFE, ANN MARIA, AND SON NATHAN.


Christopher had a heavy debt charged against Clayton Wright, a
commission merchant, of Baltimore, who claimed him as his property, and
was in the habit of hiring him out to farmers in the country, and of
taking all his hire except a single dollar, which was allotted him every
holiday.

The last item in his charge against Wright, suggested certain questions:
"How have you been used?" was the first query. "Sometimes right smart,
and then again bad enough for it," said Christopher. Again he was asked,
"What kind of a man was your master?" "He was only tolerable, I can't
say much good for him. I got tired of working and they getting my labor
and I getting nothing for my labor." At the time of his escape, he was
employed in the service of a man by the name of Cook. Christopher
described him as "a dissatisfied man, who couldn't be pleased at nothing
and his wife was like him."

This passenger was quite black, medium size, and in point of intellect,
about on a par with ordinary field hands. His wife, Ann, in point of
go-ahead-ativeness, seemed in advance of him. Indeed, she first prompted
her husband to escape.

Ann bore witness against one James Pipper, a farmer, whom she had served
as a slave, and from whom she fled, saying that "he was as mean a man as
ever walked--a dark-complected old man, with gray hair." With great
emphasis she thus continued her testimony: "He tried to work me to
death, and treated me as mean as he could, without killing me; he done
so much I couldn't tell to save my life. I wish I had as many dollars as
he has whipped me with sticks and other things. His wife will do
tolerable." "I left because he was going to sell me and my son to
Georgia; for years he had been threatening; since the boys ran away,
last spring, he was harder than ever. One was my brother, Perry, and the
other was a young man by the name of Jim." "David, my master, drank all
he could get, poured it down, and when drunk, would cuss, and tear, and
rip, and beat. He lives near the nine bridges, in Queen Ann county."

Ann was certainly a forcible narrator, and was in every way a wideawake
woman, about thirty-seven years of age. Among other questions they were
asked if they could read, etc. "Read," said Ann. "I would like to see
anybody (slave) that could read our way; to see you with a book in your
hand they would almost cut your throat."

Ann had one child only, a son, twenty years of age, who came in company
with his parents. This son belonged to the said Pipper already
described. When they started from the land of bondage they had large
hopes, but not much knowledge of the way; however, they managed to get
safely on the Underground Rail Road track, and by perseverance they
reached the Committee and were aided in the usual manner.

ARRIVAL FROM GEORGETOWN CROSS-ROADS, 1857.

LEEDS WRIGHT AND ABRAM TILISON.




For three years Leeds had been thirsting for his liberty; his heart was
fixed on that one object. He got plenty to eat, drink, and wear, but was
nevertheless dissatisfied.

The name of his master was Rev. John Wesley Pearson, who was engaged in
school teaching and preaching, and belonged to the more moderate class
of slave-holders. Once when a boy Leeds had been sold, but being very
young, he did not think much about the matter.

For the last eight or ten years previous to his escape he had not seen
his relatives, his father (George Wright) having fled to Canada, and the
remainder of the family lived some fifty miles distant, beyond the
possibility of intercourse; therefore, as he had no strong ties to
break, he could look to the time of leaving the land of bondage without
regret.



Abram, the companion of Leeds, had been less comfortably situated. His
lot in Slavery had been cast under Samuel Jarman, by whom he had been
badly treated.

Abram described him as a "big, tall, old man, who drank and was a real
wicked man; he followed farming; had thirteen children. His wife was
different; she was a pretty fine woman, but the children were all bad;
the young masters followed playing cards." No chance at all had been
allowed them to learn to read, although Abram and Leeds both coveted
this knowledge. As they felt that they would never be able to do
anything for their improvement by remaining, they decided to follow the
example of Abram's father and others and go to Canada.

ARRIVAL FROM ALEXANDRIA.

WILLIAM TRIPLETT AND THOMAS HARPER.



    Ran away from the subscriber, on Saturday night, 22d instant,
    WILLIAM TRIPLETT, a dark mulatto, with whiskers and mustache, 23
    to 26 years of age; lately had a burn on the instep of his right
    foot, but perhaps well enough to wear a boot or shoe. He took
    with him very excellent clothing, both summer and winter,
    consisting of a brown suit in cloth, summer coats striped, check
    cap, silk hat, &c. $50 reward will be paid if taken within
    thirty miles of Alexandria or in the State of Virginia, and $150
    and necessary expenses if taken out of the State and secured so
    that I get him again. He is the property of Mrs. A.B. Fairfax,
    of Alexandria, and is likely to make his way to Cincinnati,
    where he has friends, named Hamilton and Hopes, now living.
    ROBT. W. WHEAT.

    [Illustration: ]




William, answering to the above description, arrived safely in company
with Thomas Harper, about six days after the date of their departure
from the house of bondage.

Mrs. A.B. Fairfax was the loser of this "article." William spoke rather
favorably of her. He said he did not leave because he was treated badly,
but simply because he wanted to own himself--to be free. He also said
that he wanted to be able to take care of his family if he should see
fit to marry.

As to Slavery, he could see no justice in the system; he therefore made
up his mind no longer to yield submission thereto. Being a smart
"chattel," he reasoned well on the question of Slavery, and showed very
conclusively that even under the kindest mistress it had no charms for
him--that at best, it was robbery and an outrage.



Thomas Harper, his comrade, fled from John Cowling, who also lived near
Alexandria. His great trouble was, that he had a wife and family, but
could do nothing for them. He thought that it was hard to see them in
want and abused when he was not at liberty to aid or protect them. He
grew very unhappy, but could see no remedy except in flight.

Cowling, his master, was an Englishman by birth, and followed
black-smithing for a living. He was a man in humble circumstances,
trying to increase his small fortune by slave-labor.

He allowed Thomas to hire himself for one hundred dollars a year, which
amount he was required to raise, sick or well. He did not complain,
however, of having received any personal abuse from his blacksmith
master. It was the system which was daily grinding the life out of him,
that caused him to suffer, and likewise escape. By trade Thomas was also
a blacksmith. He left a wife and three children.

Harry reached the station in Philadelphia, the latter part of August,
1857. His excuse for leaving and seeking a habitation in Canada, was as
follows:

"I was treated monstrous bad; my master was a very cross, crabbed man,
and his wife was as cross as he was. The day I left they had to tie me
to beat me, what about I could not tell; this is what made me leave. I
escaped right out of his hands the day he had me; he was going with me
to the barn to tie me across a hogshead, but I broke loose from him and
ran. He ran and got the gun to shoot me, but I soon got out of his
reach, and I have not seen him since."

Harry might never have found the Underground Rail Road, but for this
deadly onslaught upon him by his master. His mind was wrought up to a
very high state of earnestness, and he was deemed a very fitting subject
for Canada.

ARRIVAL FROM NORFOLK, VA.


ABRAM WOODERS.


Although slave-holders had spared no pains to keep Abram in the dark and
to make him love his yoke, he proved by his actions, that he had no
faith in their doctrines. Nor did he want for language in which to state
the reasons for his actions. He was just in the prime of life,
thirty-five years of age, chestnut color, common size, with a scar over
the left eye, and another on the upper lip.

Like many others, he talked in a simple, earnest manner, and in answer
to queries as to how he had fared, the following is his statement:

"I was held as the property of the late Taylor Sewell, but when I
escaped I was in the service of W.C. Williams, a commission merchant. My
old master was a very severe man, but he was always very kind to me. He
had a great many more colored folks, was very severe amongst them, would
get mad and sell right away. He was a drinking man, dissipated and a
gambler, a real sportsman. He lived on Newell Creek, about twelve miles
from Norfolk. For the last eight years I was hired to W.C. Williams, for
$150 a year--if I had all that money, it might do me some good. I left
because I wanted to enjoy myself some. I felt if I staid and got old no
one would care for me, I wouldn't be of no account to nobody."

"But are not the old slaves well cared for by their masters?" a member
of the Committee here remarked. "Take care of them! no!" Abram replied
with much earnestness, and then went on to explain how such property was
left to perish. Said Abram, "There was an old man named Ike, who
belonged to the same estate that I did, he was treated like a dog; after
they could get no more work out of him, they said, 'let him die, he is
of no service; there is no use of getting a doctor for him.' Accordingly
there could be no other fate for the old man but to suffer and die with
creepers in his legs."

It was sickening to hear him narrate instances of similar suffering in
the case of old slaves. Abram left two sisters and one brother in
bondage.

    George Johnson, aged about 25 years. Height about six feet; of
    dark copper color; bushy hair; erect in stature and polite in
    his address.

    MISS ELEANOR J. CONWAY, Baltimore, Md.,

    or OLIVER DUFOUR, Washington City, D.C.

    sl-eod 2w.


"Polite in his address" as George was, he left his mistress, Eleanor J.
Conway, without bidding her good-bye, or asking for a pass. But he did
not leave his young mistress in this way without good reasons for so
doing.

In his interview with the Committee about five days after his departure
from his old home, he stated his grievances as follows: "I was born the
slave of a Mr. Conway, of Washington, D.C." Under this personage George
admitted that he had experienced slavery in rather a mild form until
death took the old man off, which event occurred when George was quite
young. He afterwards served the widow Conway until her death, and lastly
he fell into the hands of Miss Eleanor J. Conway, who resided in
Baltimore, and derived her support from the labor of slaves whom she
kept hired out as was George. Of the dead, George did not utter very
hard things, but he spoke of his young mistress as having a "very mean
principle." Said George, "She has sold one of my brothers and one of my
cousins since last April, and she was very much opposed to freedom."

Judging from the company that she kept she might before a great while
change her relations in life. George thought, however agreeable to her,
it might not be to him. So he made up his mind that his chances for
freedom would not be likely to grow any better by remaining. In the
neighborhood from which he fled he left his father, mother and two
sisters, each having different owners. Two brothers had been sold South.
Whether they ever heard what had become of the runaway George is not
known.



Thomas, the companion of George, was of a truly remarkable structure;
physically and mentally he belonged to the highest order of the bond
class. His place of chains was in the city of Washington, and the name
of the man for whom he had been compelled to do unrequited labor was
William Rowe, a bricklayer, and a "pretty clever fellow,--always used me
well," said Thomas. "Why did you leave then?" asked a member of the
Committee. He replied, "I made a proposition to my master to buy myself
for eight hundred dollars, but he refused, and wanted a thousand. Then I
made up my mind that I would make less do." Thomas had been hired out at
the National Hotel for thirty dollars a month.



Adam was well described in the following advertisement taken from the
_Baltimore Sun_:

With his fellow-passengers, George and Thomas, he greatly enjoyed the
hospitalities of the Underground Rail Road in the city of Brotherly
Love, and had a very high idea of Canada, as he anticipated becoming a
British subject at an early day. The story which Adam related concerning
his master and his reasons for escaping ran thus:

"My master was a very easy man, but would work you hard and never allow
you any chance night or day; he was a farmer, about fifty, stout, full
face, a real country ruffian; member of no church, a great drinker and
gambler; will sell a slave as quick as any other slave-holder. He had a
great deal of cash, but did not rank high in society. His wife was very
severe; hated a colored man to have any comfort in the world. They had
eight adult and nine young slaves."

Adam left because he "didn't like the treatment." Twice he had been
placed on the auction-block. He was a married man and left a wife and
one child.

FOUR ABLE-BODIED "ARTICLES" IN ONE ARRIVAL, 1857.

EDWARD, AND JOSEPH HAINES, THOMAS HARRIS, AND JAMES SHELDON.


"This certainly is a likely-looking party," are the first words which
greet the eye, on turning to the record, under which their brief
narratives were entered at the Philadelphia station, September 7th,
1857.



Edward was about forty-four years of age, of unmixed blood, and in point
of natural ability he would rank among the most intelligent of the
oppressed class. Without owing thanks to any body he could read and
write pretty well, having learned by his own exertions.

Tabby and Eliza Fortlock, sisters, and single women, had been deriving
years of leisure, comfort, and money from the sweat of Edward's brow.
The maiden ladies owned about eighteen head of this kind of property,
far more than they understood how to treat justly or civilly. They bore
the name of being very hard to satisfy. They were proverbially "stingy."
They were members of the Christ Episcopal Church.

Edward, however, remembered very sensibly that his own brother had been
sold South by these ladies; and not only he, but others also, had been
sent to the auction-block, and there made merchandise of. Edward,
therefore, had no faith in these lambs of the flock, and left them
because he thought there was reason in all things. "Yearly my task had
been increased and made heavier and heavier, until I was pressed beyond
what I could bear." Under this pressure no hope, present, or future,
could be discerned, except by escaping on the Underground Rail Road.



Joseph was also one of the chattels belonging to the Misses Portlock. A
more active and wide-awake young man of twenty years of age, could not
easily be found among the enslaved; he seemed to comprehend Slavery in
all its bearings. From a small boy he had been hired out, making money
for the "pious ladies" who owned him. His experience under these
protectors had been similar to that of Edward given above. Joseph was of
a light brown color, (some of his friends may be able to decide by this
simple fact whether he is a relative, etc.).



Tom, a full-faced, good-natured-looking young man, was also of this
party. He was about twenty-seven years of age, and was said to be the
slave of John Hatten, Esq., Cashier of the Virginia Bank of Portsmouth.
Tom admitted that he was treated very well by Mr. Hatten and his family,
except that he was not allowed his freedom; besides he felt a little
tired of having to pay twelve dollars a month for his hire, as he hired
his time of his master. Of course he was not insensible to the fact also
that he was liable to be sold any day.

In pondering over these slight drawbacks, Tom concluded that Slavery was
no place for a man who valued his freedom, it mattered not how kind
masters or mistresses might be. Under these considerations he made up
his mind that he would have to let the cashier look out for himself, and
he would do the same. In this state of mind he joined the party for
Canada.



James was another associate passenger, and the best-looking "article" in
the party; few slaves showed a greater degree of intelligence and
shrewdness. He had acquired the art of reading and writing very well,
and was also a very ready talker. He was owned by Mrs. Maria Hansford of
New York. When he was quite small he remembered seeing his mistress, but
not since. He was raised with her sister, who resided in Norfolk, the
place of James' servitude.

James confessed that he had been treated very kindly, and had been
taught to read by members of the family. This was an exceptional case,
worthy of especial note.

Notwithstanding all the kindness that James had received, he hated
Slavery, and took a deep interest in the Underground Rail Road, and used
his intelligence and shrewdness to good purpose in acting as an
Underground Rail Road agent for a time. James was a young man, about
twenty-five years of age, well made, and of a yellow complexion.

Although none of this party experienced brutal treatment personally,
they had seen the "elephant" quite to their satisfaction in Norfolk and
vicinity.

ARRIVAL FROM ARLINGTON, MD. 1857.

JOHN ALEXANDER BUTLER, WILLIAM HENRY HIPKINS, JOHN HENRY MOORE AND
GEORGE HILL.


This party made, at first sight, a favorable impression; they
represented the bone and sinew of the slave class of Arlington, and upon
investigation the Committee felt assured that they would carry with them
to Canada industry and determination such as would tell well for the
race.



John Alexander Butler was about twenty-nine years of age, well made,
dark color, and intelligent. He assured the Committee that he had been
hampered by Slavery from his birth, and that in consequence thereof he
had suffered serious hardships. He said that a man by the name of Wm.
Ford, belonging to the Methodist Church at Arlington, had defrauded him
of his just rights, and had compelled him to work on his farm for
nothing; also had deprived him of an education, and had kept him in
poverty and ignorance all his life.

In going over the manner in which he had been treated, he added that not
only was his master a hard man, but that his wife and children partook
of the same evil spirit; "they were all hard." True, they had but three
slaves to oppress, but these they spared not.

John was a married man, and spoke affectionately of his wife and
children, whom he had to leave behind at Cross-Roads.



William Henry, who was heart and soul in earnest with regard to reaching
Canada, and was one of this party, was twenty-three years of age, and
was a stout, yellow man with a remarkably large head, and looked as if
he was capable of enjoying Canada and caring for himself.

In speaking of the fettered condition from which he had escaped, the
name of Ephraim Swart, "a gambler and spree'r" was mentioned as the
individual who had wronged him of his liberty most grievously.

Against Swart he expressed himself with much manly feeling, and judging
from his manner he appeared to be a dangerous customer for master Swart
to encounter north of Mason and Dixon's line.

William complained that Swart "would come home late at night drunk, and
if he did not find us awake he would not attempt to wake us, but would
begin cutting and slashing with a cowhide. He treated his wife very bad
too; sometimes when she would stand up for the servants he would knock
her down. Many times at midnight she would have to leave the house and
go to her mother's for safety; she was a very nice woman, but he was the
very old Satan himself."

While William Henry was debarred from learning letters under his brutal
overseer, he nevertheless learned how to plan ways and means by which to
escape his bondage. He left his old mother and two brothers wholly
ignorant of his movements.



John Henry Moore, another one of the Arlington party, was about
twenty-four years of age, a dark, spare-built man. He named David
Mitchell, of Havre-de-Grace, as the individual above all others who had
kept his foot on his neck. Without undertaking to give John Henry's
description of Mitchell in full, suffice it to give the following facts:
"Mitchell would go off and get drunk, and come home, and if the slaves
had not as much work done as he had tasked them with, he would go to
beating them with clubs or anything he could get in his hand. He was a
tall, spare-built man, with sandy hair. He had a wife and family, but
his wife was no better than he was." When charges or statements were
made by fugitives against those from whom they escaped, particular pains
were taken to find out if such statements could be verified; if the
explanation appeared valid, the facts as given were entered on the
books.

John Henry could not read, but greatly desired to learn, and he looked
as though he had a good head for so doing. Before he left there had been
some talk of selling him South. This rumor had a marked effect upon John
Henry's nervous system; it also expanded his idea touching traveling,
the Underground Rail Road, etc. As he had brothers and sisters who had
been sold to Georgia he made up his mind that his master was not to be
trusted for a single day; he was therefore one of the most
willing-hearted passengers in the party.



George Hill, also a fellow-passenger, was about twenty-four years of
age, quite black, medium size, and of fair, natural mother wit. In
looking back upon his days of bondage, his mind reverted to Dr.
Savington, of Harford county, as the person who owed him for years of
hard and unrequited toil, and at the same time was his so-called owner.

The Doctor, it seemed, had failed to treat George well, for he declared
that he had never received enough to eat the whole time that he was with
him. "The clothes I have on I got by overwork of nights. When I started
I hadn't a shoe on my foot, these were given to me. He was an old man,
but a very wicked man, and drank very hard."

George had been taught field work pretty thoroughly, but nothing in the
way of reading and writing.

George explained why he left as follows: "I left because I had got along
with him as well as I could. Last Saturday a week he was in a great rage
and drunk. He shot at me. He never went away but what he would come home
drunk, and if any body made him angry out from home, he would come home
and take his spite out of his people."

He owned three grown men, two women and six children. Thus hating
Slavery heartily, George was enthusiastically in favor of Canada.

FIVE PASSENGERS, 1857.

ELIZA JANE JOHNSON, HARRIET STEWART, AND HER DAUGHTER MARY ELIZA,
WILLIAM COLE, AND HANSON HALL.




Eliza Jane was a tall, dark, young woman, about twenty-three years of
age, and had been held to service by a widow woman, named Sally Spiser,
who was "anything but a good woman." The place of her habitation was in
Delaware, between Concord and Georgetown.

Eliza Jane's excuse for leaving was this: She charged her mistress with
trying to work her to death, and with unkind treatment generally. When
times became so hard that she could not stand her old mistress "Sally"
any longer, she "took out."



Harriet did not come in company with Eliza Jane, but by accident they
met at the station in Philadelphia. Harriet and daughter came from
Washington, D.C.

Harriet had treasured up a heavy account against a white man known by
the name of William A. Linton, whom she described as a large, red-faced
man, who had in former years largely invested in slave property, but
latterly he had been in the habit of selling off, until only seven
remained, and among them she and her child were numbered; therefore, she
regarded him as one who had robbed her of her rights, and daily
threatened her with sale.

Harriet was a very likely-looking woman, twenty-nine years of age,
medium size, and of a brown color, and far from being a stupid person.
Her daughter also was a smart, and interesting little girl of eight
years of age, and seemed much pleased to be getting out of the reach of
slave-holders. The mother and daughter, however, had not won their
freedom thus far, without great suffering, from the long and fatiguing
distance which they were obliged to walk. Sometimes the hardness of the
road made them feel as though they would be compelled to give up the
journey, whether or not; but they added to their faith, patience, and
thus finally succeeded.

Heavy rewards were offered through advertisements in the Baltimore Sun,
but they availed naught. The Vigilance Committee received them safely,
fully cared for them, and safely sent them through to the land of
refuge. Harriet's daring undertaking obliged her to leave her husband,
John Stewart, behind; also one sister, a slave in Georgetown. One
brother had been sold South. Her mother she had laid away in a slave's
grave: but her father she hoped to find in Canada, he having escaped
thither when she was a small girl; at least it was supposed that he had
gone there.

ARRIVAL FROM HOWARD CO., MD., 1857.


BILL COLE AND HANSON.



    $500 REWARD.--Ran away on Saturday night, September 5th, Bill
    Cole, aged about 37 years, of copper complexion, stout built,
    ordinary height, walks very erect, earnest but squint look when
    spoken to.

    [Illustration: ]

    Also, Hanson, copper complexion, well made, sickly look, medium
    height, stoops when walking, quick when spoken to; aged about 30
    years.

    Three hundred dollars will be paid for the apprehension and
    delivery of Bill, if caught out of the State, and two hundred if
    in the State. Two hundred dollars for Hanson if out of the
    State, and one hundred dollars if in the State.

    W. BAKER DORSEY,

    HAMMOND DORSEY,

    Savage P.O., Howard county, Md.


Such notoriety as was given them by the above advertisement, did not in
the least damage Bill and Hanson in the estimation of the Committee. It
was rather pleasing to know that they were of so much account as to call
forth such a public expression from the Messrs. Dorsey. Besides it saved
the Committee the necessity of writing out a description of them, the
only fault found with the advertisement being in Reference to their
ages. Bill, for instance, was put down ten years younger than he claimed
to be. Which was correct, Bill or his master? The Committee were
inclined to believe Bill in preference to his master, for the simple
reason that he seemed to account satisfactorily for his master's making
him so young: he (the master) could sell him for much more at
thirty-seven than at forty-seven. Unscrupulous horse-jockies and traders
in their fellow-men were about on a par as to that kind of sharp
practice.

Hanson, instead of being only thirty, declared that he was thirty-seven
the fifteenth of February. These errors are noticed and corrected
because it is barely possible that Bill and Hanson may still be lost to
their relatives, who may be inquiring and hunting in every direction for
them, and as many others may turn to these records with hope, it is,
therefore, doubly important that these descriptions shall be as far as
possible, correct, especially as regards ages.

Hanson laughed heartily over the idea that he looked "sickly." While on
the Underground Rail Road, he looked very far from sickly; on the
contrary, a more healthy, fat, and stout-looking piece of property no
one need wish to behold, than was this same Hanson. He confessed,
however, that for some time previous to his departure, he had feigned
sickness,--told his master that he was "sick all over." "Ten times a day
Hanson said they would ask him how he was, but was not willing to make
his task much lighter." The following description was given of his
master, and his reason for leaving him:

"My master was a red-faced farmer, severe temper, would curse, and
swear, and drink, and sell his slaves whenever he felt like it. My
mistress was a pretty cross, curious kind of a woman too, though she was
a member of the Protestant Church. They were rich, and had big farms and
a good many slaves. They didn't allow me any provisions hardly; I had a
wife, but they did not allow me to go see her, only once in a great
while."

Bill providentially escaped from a well-known cripple, whom he undertook
to describe as a "very sneaking-looking man, medium size, smooth face; a
wealthy farmer, who owned eighteen or twenty head of slaves, and was
Judge of the Orphans' Court." "He sells slaves occasionally." "My
mistress was a very large, rough, Irish-looking woman, with a very bad
disposition; it appeared like as if she hated to see a 'nigger,' and she
was always wanting her husband to have some one whipped, and she was a
member of the Methodist Church. My master was a trustee in the Episcopal
Church."

In consequence of the tribulation Bill had experienced under his
Christian master and mistress, he had been led to disbelieve in the
Protestant faith altogether, and declared that he felt persuaded that it
was all a "pretense," and added that he "never went to Church; no place
was provided in church for 'niggers' except a little pen for the
coachmen and waiters."

Bill had been honored with the post of "head man on the place," but of
this office he was not proud.

ARRIVAL FROM PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY, MD.


"JIM BELLE."



    $100 REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber on Saturday night,
    Negro Man JIM BELLE. Jim is about five feet ten inches high,
    black color, about 26 years of age has a down look; speaks slow
    when spoken to; he has large, thick lips, and a mustache. He was
    formerly owned by Edward Stansbury, late of Baltimore county,
    and purchased by Edward Worthington, near Reisterstown, in
    Baltimore county, at the late Stansbury's sale, who sold him to
    B.M. and W.L. Campbell, of Baltimore city, of whom I purchased
    Jim on the 13th of June last. His wife lives with her mother,
    Ann Robertson, in Corn Alley, between Lee and Hill streets,
    Baltimore city, where he has other relations, and where he is
    making his way. I will give the above reward, no matter where
    taken, so he is brought home or secured in jail so I get him
    again.

    ZACHARIAH BERRY, of W.,

    near Upper Marlboro', Prince George's county, Md.


Mr. Zachariah Berry, who manifested so much interest in Jim, may be
until this hour in ignorance of the cause of his running off without
asking leave, etc. Jim stated, that he was once sold and flogged
unmercifully simply for calling his master "Mr.," instead of master, and
he alleged that this was the secret of his eyes being opened and his
mind nerved to take advantage of the Underground Rail Road.

While it may not now do Zachariah Berry much good to learn this secret,
it may, nevertheless, be of some interest to those who were of near kin
to Jim to glean even so small a ray of light.

ARRIVAL FROM RAPPAHANNOCK COUNTY, 1857.


PASCAL QUANTENCE.


Pascal fled from Virginia, and accused Bannon and Brady of doing
violence to his liberty. He had, however, been in their clutches only a
short while before escaping, but that short while seemed almost an age,
as he was treated so meanly by them compared with the treatment which he
had experienced under his former master.

According to Pascal's story, which was evidently true, his previous
master was his own father (John Quantence), who had always acknowledged
Pascal as his child, whom he did not scruple to tell people he should
set free; that he did not intend that he should serve anybody else. But,
while out riding one day, he was thrown from his horse and instantly
killed. Naturally enough, no will being found, his effects were all
administered upon and Pascal was sold with the farm. Bannon and Brady
were the purchasers, at least of Pascal. In their power, immediately the
time of trouble began with Pascal, and so continued until he could no
longer endure it. "Hoggishness," according to Pascal's phraseology, was
the most predominant trait in the character of his new masters. In his
mournful situation and grief he looked toward Canada and started with
courage and hope, and thus succeeded. Such deliverances always afforded
very great joy to the Committee.

ARRIVAL FROM NORTH CAROLINA, 1857.

HARRY GRIMES, GEORGE UPSHER, AND EDWARD LEWIS.


FEET SLIT FOR RUNNING AWAY, FLOGGED, STABBED, STAYED IN THE HOLLOW OF A
BIG POPLAR TREE, VISITED BY A SNAKE, ABODE IN A CAVE. The coming of the
passengers here noticed was announced in the subjoined letter from
Thomas Garrett:


    WILMINGTON, 11th Mo. 25th, 1857.

    RESPECTED FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--I write to inform thee, that
    Captain Fountain has arrived this evening from the South with
    three men, one of which is nearly naked, and very lousy. He has
    been in the swamps of Carolina for eighteen months past. One of
    the others has been some time out. I would send them on
    to-night, but will have to provide two of them with some clothes
    before they can be sent by rail road. I have forgotten the
    number of thy house. As most likely all are more or less lousy,
    having been compelled to sleep together, I thought best to write
    thee so that thee may get a suitable place to take them to, and
    meet them at Broad and Prime streets on the arrival of the cars,
    about 11 o'clock to-morrow evening. I have engaged one of our
    men to take them to his house, and go to Philadelphia with them
    to-morrow evening. Johnson who will accompany them is a man in
    whom we can confide. Please send me the number of thy house when
    thee writes.

    THOMAS GARRETT.


This epistle from the old friend of the fugitive, Thomas Garrett,
excited unusual interest. Preparation was immediately made to give the
fugitives a kind reception, and at the same time to destroy their
plagues, root and branch, without mercy.

They arrived according to appointment. The cleansing process was carried
into effect most thoroughly, and no vermin were left to tell the tale of
suffering they had caused. Straightway the passengers were made
comfortable in every way, and the spirit of freedom seemed to be burning
like "fire shut up in the bones." The appearance alone of these men
indicated their manhood, and wonderful natural ability. The examining
Committee were very desirous of hearing their story without a moment's
delay.



As Harry, from having suffered most, was the hero of this party, and
withal was an intelligent man, he was first called upon to make his
statement as to how times had been with him in the prison house, from
his youth up. He was about forty-six years of age, according to his
reckoning, full six feet high, and in muscular appearance was very
rugged, and in his countenance were evident marks of firmness. He said
that he was born a slave in North Carolina, and had been sold three
times. He was first sold when a child three years of age, the second
time when he was thirteen years old, and the third and last time he was
sold to Jesse Moore, from whom he fled. Prior to his coming into the
hands of Moore he had not experienced any very hard usage, at least
nothing more severe than fell to the common lot of slave-boys, therefore
the period of his early youth was deemed of too little interest to
record in detail. In fact time only could be afforded for noticing very
briefly some of the more remarkable events of his bondage. The examining
Committee confined their interrogations to his last taskmaster.

"How did Moore come by you?" was one of the inquiries. "He bought me,"
said Harry, "of a man by the name of Taylor, nine or ten years ago; he
was as bad as he could be, couldn't be any worse to be alive. He was
about fifty years of age, when I left him, a right red-looking man, big
bellied old fellow, weighs about two hundred and forty pounds. He drinks
hard, he is just like a rattlesnake, just as cross and crabbed when he
speaks, seems like he could go through you. He flogged Richmond for not
ploughing the corn good, that was what he pretended to whip him for.
Richmond ran away, was away four months, as nigh as I can guess, then
they cotched him, then struck him a hundred lashes, and then they split
both feet to the bone, and split both his insteps, and then master took
his knife and stuck it into him in many places; after he done him that
way, he put him into the barn to shucking corn. For a long time he was
not able to work; when he did partly recover, he was set to work again."

We ceased to record anything further concerning Richmond, although not a
fourth part of what Harry narrated was put upon paper. The account was
too sickening and the desire to hear Harry's account of himself too
great to admit of further delay; so Harry confined himself to the
sufferings and adventures which had marked his own life. Briefly he gave
the following facts: "I have been treated bad. One day we were grubbing
and master said we didn't do work enough. 'How came there was no more
work done that day?' said master to me. I told him I did work. In a more
stormy manner he 'peated the question. I then spoke up and said: 'Massa,
I don't know what to say.' At once massa plunged his knife into my neck
causing me to stagger. Massa was drunk. He then drove me down to the
black folk's houses (cabins of the slaves). He then got his gun, called
the overseer, and told him to get some ropes. While he was gone I said,
'Massa, now you are going to tie me up and cut me all to pieces for
nothing. I would just as leave you would take your gun and shoot me down
as to tie me up and cut me all to pieces for nothing.' In a great rage
he said 'go.' I jumped, and he put up his gun and snapped both barrels
at me. He then set his dogs on me, but as I had been in the habit of
making much of them, feeding them, &c. they would not follow me, and I
kept on straight to the woods. My master and the overseer cotched the
horses and tried to run me down, but as the dogs would not follow me
they couldn't make nothing of it. It was the last of August a year ago.
The devil was into him, and he flogged and beat four of the slaves, one
man and three of the women, and said if he could only get hold of me he
wouldn't strike me, 'nary-a-lick,' but would tie me to a tree and empty
both barrels into me.

[Illustration: ]

In the woods I lived on nothing, you may say, and something too. I had
bread, and roasting ears, and 'taters. I stayed in the hollow of a big
poplar tree for seven months; the other part of the time I stayed in a
cave. I suffered mighty bad with the cold and for something to eat. Once
I got me some charcoal and made me a fire in my tree to warm me, and it
liked to killed me, so I had to take the fire out. One time a snake come
to the tree, poked its head in the hollow and was coming in, and I took
my axe and chopped him in two. It was a poplar leaf moccasin, the
poisonest kind of a snake we have. While in the woods all my thoughts
was how to get away to a free country."

[Illustration: ]

Subsequently, in going back over his past history, he referred to the
fact, that on an occasion long before the cave and tree existence,
already noticed, when suffering under this brutal master, he sought
protection in the woods and abode twenty-seven months in a cave, before
he surrendered himself, or was captured. His offence, in this instance,
was simply because he desired to see his wife, and "stole" away from his
master's plantation and went a distance of five miles, to where she
lived, to see her. For this grave crime his master threatened to give
him a hundred lashes, and to shoot him; in order to avoid this
punishment, he escaped to the woods, etc. The lapse of a dozen years and
recent struggles for an existence, made him think lightly of his former
troubles and he would, doubtless, have failed to recall his earlier
conflicts but for the desire manifested by the Committee to get all the
information out of him they could.

He was next asked, "Had you a wife and family?" "Yes, sir,". he
answered, "I had a wife and eight children, belonged to the widow
Slade." Harry gave the names of his wife and children as follows: Wife,
Susan, and children, Oliver, Sabey, Washington, Daniel, Jonas, Harriet,
Moses and Rosetta, the last named he had never seen. "Between my
mistress and my master there was not much difference."

Of his comrades time admitted of writing out only very brief sketches,
as follows:



EDWARD LEWIS.



    $100 REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber, on the 7th of
    November, negro slave, EDGAR. He is 36 years old, 6 feet high,
    of dark brown complexion, very high forehead, is a little bald,
    and is inclined to stoop in the shoulders. Edgar says he was
    raised in Norfolk county, has worked about Norfolk several
    years. I bought him at the Auction house of Messrs. Pulham &
    Davis, the 20th of July, 1856. The bill of sale was signed by
    W.Y. Milmer for Jas. A. Bilisoly, administrator of G.W.
    Chambers, dec'd. He told one of my negroes he was going to
    Norfolk to sell some plunder he had there, then go to Richmond,
    steal his wife, get on board a boat about Norfolk, and go to a
    free State. He can read and write well, and I have no doubt he
    has provided himself with papers of some kind. He may have
    purchased the papers of some free negro. I will give the above
    reward of One Hundred Dollars to any person who will arrest and
    confine him, so I can get him.

    [Illustration: ]

    C.H. GAY.

    My Post office is Laurel, N.C. no. 21.


The above advertisement, which was cut from a Southern paper, brought
light in regard to one of the passengers at least. It was not often that
a slave was so fortunate as to get such a long sketch of himself in a
newspaper. The description is so highly complimentary, that we simply
endorse it as it stands. The sketch as taken for the record book is here
transcribed as follows:

"Edward reported himself from Franklin county, N.C., where, according to
statement, a common farmer by the name of Carter Gay owned him, under
whose oppression his life was rendered most unhappy, who stinted him
daily for food and barely allowed him clothing enough to cover his
nakedness, who neither showed justice nor mercy to any under his
control, the 'weaker vessels' not excepted; therefore Edward was
convinced that it was in vain to hope for comfort under such a master.
Moreover, his appetite for liquor, combined with a high temper, rendered
him a being hard to please, but easy to excite to a terrible degree.
Scarcely had Edward lived two years with this man (Gay) when he felt
that he had lived with him long enough. Two years previous to his coming
into the hands of Gay, he and his wife were both sold; the wife one day
and he the next. She brought eleven hundred and twenty-five dollars, and
he eight hundred and thirty-five dollars; thus they were sold and resold
as a matter of speculation, and husband and wife were parted."

After the fugitives had been well cared for by the Committee, they were
forwarded on North; but for some reason they were led to stop short of
Canada, readily finding employment and going to work to take care of
themselves. How they were received and in what way they were situated,
the subjoined letter from Edward will explain:


    SKANEATELES, Dec. 17, 1857.

    DEAR SIR:--As I promised to let you hear from me as soon as I
    found a home, I will now fulfill my promise to you and say that
    I am alive and well and have found a stopping place for the
    winter.

    When we arrived at Syracuse we found Mr. Loguen ready to receive
    us, and as times are rather hard in Canada he thought best for
    us not to go there, so he sent us about twenty miles west of
    Syracuse to Skaneateles, where George Upshur and myself soon
    found work. Henry Grimes is at work in Garden about eight miles
    from this place.

    If you should chance to hear any of my friends inquiring for me,
    please direct them to Skaneateles, Onondaga county, N.Y.

    If you can inform me of the whereabouts of Miss Alice Jones I
    shall be very much obliged to you, until I can pay you better. I
    forgot to ask you about her when I was at your house. She
    escaped about two years ago.

    Please not to forget to inquire of my wife, Rachel Land, and if
    you should hear of her, let me know immediately, George Upshur
    and myself send our best respects to you and your family.
    Remember us to Mrs. Jackson and Miss Julia. I hope to meet you
    all again, if not on earth may we so live that we shall meet in
    that happy land where tears and partings are not known.

    Let me hear from you soon. This from your friend and well
    wisher,

    EDWARD LEWIS,

    formerly, but now WILLIAM BRADY.




GEORGE UPSHER.--The third in this arrival was also a full man. Slavery
had robbed him shamefully it is true; nevertheless he was a man of
superior natural parts, physically and intellectually. Despite the
efforts of slave-holders to keep him in the dark, he could read and
write a little. His escape in the manner that he did, implied a direct
protest against the conduct of Dr. Thomas W. Upsher, of Richmond, Va.,
whom, he alleged, deprived him of his hire, and threatened him with
immediate sale. He had lived in North Carolina with the doctor about two
years. As a slave, his general treatment had been favorable, except for
a few months prior to his flight, which change on the part of his master
led him to fear that a day of sale was nigh at hand. In fact the seventh
of July had been agreed upon when he was to be in Richmond, to take his
place with others in the market on sale day; his hasty and resolute move
for freedom originated from this circumstance. He was well-known in
Norfolk, and had served almost all his days in that city. These
passengers averaged about six feet, and were of uncommonly
well-developed physical structure.

The pleasure of aiding such men from the horrors of Carolina Slavery was
great.

ALFRED HOLLON, GEORGE AND CHARLES N. RODGERS.


The loss of this party likewise falls on Maryland. With all the efforts
exerted by slave-holders, they could not prevent the Underground Rail
Road from bringing away passengers.



Alfred was twenty-eight years of age, with sharp features, dark color,
and of medium size. He charged one Elijah J. Johnson, a commissioner of
Baltimore Co., with having deprived him of the fruits of his labor. He
had looked fully into his master's treatment of him, and had come to the
conclusion that it was wrong in every respect, for one man to make
another work and then take all his wages from him; thus decided, Alfred,
desiring liberty, whereby he could do better for himself felt that he
must "took out" and make his way to Canada. Nevertheless, he admitted
that he had been "treated pretty well" compared with others. True, he
had "not been fed very well;" Elijah, his master, was an old man with a
white head, tall and stout, and the owner of fifteen head of slaves. At
the same time, a member of St. John's church.

Alfred had treasured up the sad remembrance against him of the sale of
his mother from him when a little boy, only three years old. While he
was then too young to have retained her features in his memory, the fact
had always been a painful one to reflect upon.



George was twenty-six years of age, stout, long-faced, and of dark
complexion. He looked as though he might have eagerly grasped education
if the opportunity had been allowed him. He too belonged to Elijah J.
Johnson, against whom he entertained much more serious objections than
Alfred. Indeed, George did not hesitate to say with emphasis, that he
neither liked his old master, mistress, nor any of the family. Without
recording his grievances in detail, a single instance will suffice of
the kind of treatment to which he objected, and which afforded the
pretext for his becoming a patron of the Underground Rail Road.

It was this, said George: "I went into the corn-field and got some corn.
This made my master and mistress very mad, and about it Dr. Franklin
Rodgers, my young mistress' husband, struck me some pretty heavy blows,
and knocked me with his fist, etc." Thus, George's blood was raised, and
he at once felt that it was high time to be getting away from such
patriarchs. It was only necessary to form a strong resolution and to
start without delay.

There were two others who, he believed, could be trusted, so he made
known his intentions to them, and finding them sound on the question of
freedom he was glad of their company. For an emergency, he provided
himself with a pair of pistols and a formidable-looking knife, and
started, bent on reaching Canada; determined at least, not to be taken
back to bondage alive. Charles was twenty-four years of age, a very
dark-colored individual, and also belonged to said Johnson.



Charles was well acquainted with his old master and mistress, and made
very quick work of giving his experience. After hearing him, from the
manner in which he expressed himself, no one could doubt his earnestness
and veracity. His testimony ran substantially thus:

"For the last three years I have been treated very hard. In the presence
of the servants, old Johnson had me tied, stripped, and with his own
hands, flogged me on the naked back shamefully. The old mistress was
cross too." It was some time before the smarting ceased, but it was not
long ere the suffering produced very decided aspirations to get over to
John Bull's Dominions. He resolved to go, at all hazards. In order that
he might not be surprised on the Underground Rail Road without any
weapons of defense, determined as he was to fight rather than be dragged
back, he provided himself with a heavy, leaden ball and a razor. They
met, however, with no serious difficulty, save from hard walking and
extreme hunger. In appearance, courage, and mother-wit, this party was
of much promise.

ARRIVAL FROM KENT COUNTY, 1857.

SAMUEL BENTON, JOHN ALEXANDER, JAMES HENRY, AND SAMUEL TURNER.


These passengers journeyed together from the land of whips and chains.



Sam Benton was about twenty-six years of age, medium size, pretty dark
color, and possessed a fair share of intelligence. He understood very
well how sadly Slavery had wronged him by keeping him in ignorance and
poverty.

He stated as the cause of his flight that William Campbell had oppressed
him and kept him closely at hard labor without paying him, and at the
same time "did not give him half enough to eat, and no clothing."



John Alexander was about forty-four years of age, a man of ordinary
size, quite black, and a good specimen of a regular corn-field hand.

"Why did you leave, John?" said a member of the Committee. He coolly
replied that "Handy (his master was named George Handy) got hold of me
twice, and I promised my Lord that he should never get hold of me
another time."

Of course it was the severity of these two visitations that made John a
thinker and an actor at the same time. The evil practices of the master
produced the fruits of liberty in John's breast.



James Henry, the third passenger, was about thirty-two years of age, and
quite a spirited-looking "article." A few months before he fled he had
been sold, at which time his age was given as "only twenty." He had
suffered considerably from various abuses; the hope of Canada however
tended to make him joyful.

The system of oppression from which these travelers fled had afforded
them no privileges in the way of learning to read. All that they had
ever known of civilization was what they perchance picked up in the
ordinary routine of the field.

Notice of the fourth passenger unfortunately is missing.

ARRIVAL FROM BALTIMORE COUNTY, 1857.


ELIZABETH WILLIAMS.


Elizabeth fled in company with her brother the winter previous to her
arrival at the Philadelphia station. Although she reached free land the
severe struggle cost her the loss of all her toes. Four days and nights
out in the bitter cold weather without the chance of a fire left them a
prey to the frost, which made sad havoc with their feet
especially--particularly Elizabeth's. She was obliged to stop on the
way, and for seven months she was unable to walk.

Elizabeth was about twenty years of age, chestnut color, and of
considerable natural intellect. Although she suffered so severely as the
result of her resolution to throw off the yoke, she had no regrets at
leaving the prison-house; she seemed to appreciate freedom all the more
in consequence of what it cost her to obtain the prize.

In speaking of the life she had lived, she stated that her mistress was
"good enough," but her "master was a very bad man." His name was Samuel
Ward; he lived in Baltimore county, near Wrightstown. Elizabeth left her
mother, four brothers and one sister under the yoke.

MARY COOPER AND MOSES ARMSTEAD, 1857.




Mary arrived from Delaware, Moses from Norfolk, Virginia, and happened
to meet at the station in Philadelphia.

Mary was twenty years of age, of a chestnut color, usual size, and well
disposed. She fled from Nathaniel Herne, an alderman. Mary did not find
fault with the alderman, but she could not possibly get along with his
wife; this was the sole cause of her escape.



Moses was twenty-four years of age, of a chestnut color, a
bright-looking young man. He fled from Norfolk, Virginia, having been
owned by the estate of John Halters. Nothing but the prevailing love of
liberty in the breast of Moses moved him to seek his freedom. He did not
make one complaint of bad treatment.

ARRIVAL FROM NEAR WASHINGTON, D.C.

JOHN JOHNSON AND LAWRENCE THORNTON.




John escaped from near Washington. He stated that he was owned by an
engraver, known by the name of William Stone, and added that himself and
seven others were kept working on the farm of said Stone for nothing.
John did not, however, complain of having a hard master in this
hard-named personage, (Stone); for, as a slave, he confessed that he had
seen good times. Yet he was not satisfied; he felt that he had a right
to his freedom, and that he could not possibly be contented while
deprived of it, for this reason, therefore, he dissolved his
relationship with his kind master.

John was about twenty-seven years of age, smart, possessed good manners,
and a mulatto.



Lawrence was about twenty-three years of age, tall and slender, of dark
complexion, but bright intellectually. With Lawrence times had been
pretty rough. Dr. Isaac Winslow of Alexandria was accused of defrauding
Lawrence of his hire. "He was anything else but a gentleman," said
Lawrence. "He was not a fair man no way, and his wife was worse than he
was, and she had a daughter worse than herself."

"Last Sunday a week my master collared me, for my insolence he said, and
told me that he would sell me right off. I was tied and put up stairs
for safe keeping. I was tied for about eight hours. I then untied
myself, broke out of prison, and made for the Underground Rail Road
immediately."

Lawrence gave a most interesting account of his life of bondage, and of
the doctor and his family. He was overjoyed at the manner in which he
had defeated the doctor, and so was the Committee.

HON. L. McLANE'S PROPERTY, SOON AFTER HIS DEATH, TRAVELS _viâ_ THE
UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD.--WILLIAM KNIGHT, ESQ., LOSES A SUPERIOR
"ARTICLE."

JIM SCOTT, TOM PENNINGTON, SAM SCOTT, BILL SCOTT, ABE BACON, AND JACK
WELLS.


An unusual degree of pleasure was felt in welcoming this party of young
men, not because they were any better than others, or because they had
suffered more, but simply because they were found to possess certain
knowledge and experience of slave life, as it existed under the
government of the chivalry; such information could not always be
obtained from those whose lot had been cast among ordinary
slave-holders. Consequently the Committee interviewed them closely, and
in point of intellect found them to be above the average run of slaves.
As they were then entered on the record, so in like manner are the notes
made of them transferred to these pages.



Jim was about nineteen years of age, well grown, black, and of
prepossessing appearance. The organ of hope seemed very strong in him.
Jim had been numbered with the live stock of the late Hon. L. McLane,
who had been called to give an account of his stewardship about two
months before Jim and his companions "took out."

As to general usage, he made no particular charge against his
distinguished master; he had, however, not been living under his
immediate patriarchal government, but had been hired out to a farmer by
the name of James Dodson, with whom he experienced life "sometimes hard
and sometimes smooth," to use his own words. The reason of his leaguing
with his fellow-servants to abandon the old prison-house, was traceable
to the rumor, that he and some others were to appear on the stage, or
rather the auction-block, in Baltimore, the coming Spring.



Tom, another member of the McLane institution, was about twenty-five
years of age, of unmixed blood, and a fair specimen of a well-trained
field-hand. He conceived that he had just ground to bring damages
against the Hon. L. McLane for a number of years of hard service, and
for being deprived of education. He had been compelled to toil for the
Honorable gentleman, not only on his own place, but on the farms of
others. At the time that Tom escaped, he was hired for one hundred
dollars per annum (and his clothes found him), which hire McLane had
withheld from him contrary to all justice and fair dealing; but as Tom
was satisfied, that he could get no justice through the Maryland courts,
and knew that an old and intimate friend of his master had already
proclaimed, that "negroes had no rights which white men are bound to
respect;" also, as his experience tended to confirm him in the belief,
that the idea was practically carried out in the courts of Maryland; he
thought, that it would be useless to put in a plea for justice in
Maryland. He was not, however, without a feeling of some satisfaction,
that his old master, in giving an account of his stewardship at the Bar
of the Just One, would be made to understand the amount of his
indebtedness to those whom he had oppressed. With this impression, and
the prospects of equal rights and Canada, under her British Majesty's
possessions, he manifested as much delight as if he was traveling with a
half million of dollars in his pocket.



Sam, another likely-looking member of this party, was twenty-two years
of age, and a very promising-looking young fugitive, having the
appearance of being able to take education without difficulty. He had
fully made up his mind, that slavery was never intended for man, and
that he would never wear himself out working for the "white people for
nothing." He wanted to work for himself and enjoy the benefits of
education, etc.



Bill Scott, another member of the McLane party, was twenty-one years of
age, "fat and slick," and fully satisfied, that Canada would agree with
him in every particular. Not a word did he utter in favor of Maryland,
but said much against the manner in which slaves were treated, how he
had felt about the matter, etc.



Abe was also from the McLane estate. He possessed apparently more
general intelligence than either of his companions. He was quite
bright-witted, a ready talker, and with his prospects he was much
satisfied. He was twenty-two years of age, black, good-looking, and
possessed very good manners. He represented, that his distinguished
master died, leaving thirteen head of slaves. His (Abe's) father, Tom's
mother and the mother of the Scotts were freed by McLane. Strong hopes
were entertained that before the old man's death he would make provision
in his will for the freedom of all the other slaves; when he died, the
contrary was found to be the fact; they were still left in chains. The
immediate heirs consisted of six sons and five daughters, who moved in
the first circle, were "very wealthy and aristocratic." Abe was
conversant with the fact, that his master, the "Hon. L. McLane, was once
Secretary under President Jackson;" that he had been "sent to England on
a mission for the Government," and that he had "served two terms in
Congress." Some of the servants, Abe said, were "treated pretty well,
but some others could not say anything in the master's favor." Upon the
whole, however, it was manifest that the McLane slaves had not been
among the number who had seen severe hardships. They came from his
plantation in Cecil county, Maryland, where they had been reared.

In order to defend themselves on the Underground Rail Road, they were
strongly armed. Sam had a large horse pistol and a butcher knife; Jack
had a revolver; Abe had a double-barrelled pistol and a large knife; Jim
had a single-barrelled pistol and counted on "blowing a man down if any
one touched" him. Bill also had a single-barrelled pistol, and when he
started resolved to "come through or die."

Although this party was of the class said to be well fed, well clothed,
and not over-worked, yet to those who heard them declare their utter
detestation of slavery and their determination to use their instruments
of death, even to the taking of life, rather than again be subjected to
the yoke, it was evident that even the mildest form of slavery was
abhorrent. They left neither old nor young masters, whom they desired to
serve any longer or look up to for care and support.



Jack, who was not of the McLane party, but who came with them, had been
kept in ignorance with regard to his age. He was apparently middle-aged,
medium size, dark color, and of average intelligence. He accused William
Knight, a farmer, of having enslaved him contrary to his will or wishes,
and averred that he fled from him because he used him badly and kept
mean overseers. Jack said that his master owned six farms and kept three
overseers to manage them. The slaves numbered twenty-one head. The names
of the overseers were given in the following order: "Alfred King, Jimmy
Allen, and Thomas Brockston." In speaking of their habits, Jack said,
that they were "very smart when the master was about, but as soon as he
was gone they would instantly drop back." "They were all mean, but the
old boss was meaner than them all," and "the overseers were 'fraider' of
him than what I was," said Jack.

His master (Mr. Knight), had a wife and seven children, and was a member
of the Episcopal Church, in "good and regular standing." He was rich,
and, with his family, moved in good society. "His wife was too stingy to
live, and if she was to die, she would die holding on to something,"
said Jack. Jack had once had a wife and three children, but as they
belonged to a slave-holder ("Jim Price") Jack's rights were wholly
ignored, and he lost them.

ARRIVAL FROM HARFORD CO., 1857.


JOHN MYERS.


John fled from under the yoke of Dr. Joshua R. Nelson. Until within two
years of "Jack's" flight, the doctor "had been a very fine man," with
whom Jack found no fault. But suddenly his mode of treatment changed; he
became very severe. Nothing that Jack could do, met the approval of the
doctor. Jack was constantly looked upon with suspicion.

The very day that Jack fled, four men approached him (the doctor one of
them), with line in hand; that sign was well understood, and Jack
resolved that they should not get within tying distance of him. "I
dodged them," said Jack. Never afterwards was Jack seen in that part of
the country, at least as long as a fetter remained.

The day that he "dodged" he also took the Underground Rail Road, and
although ignorant of letters, he battled his way out of Maryland, and
succeeded in reaching Pennsylvania and the Committee. He was obliged to
leave four children behind--John, Abraham, Jane and Ellen.

Jack's wife had been freed and had come to Philadelphia two years in
advance of him. His master evidently supposed that Jack would be mean
enough to wish to see his wife, even in a free State, and that no slave,
with such an unnatural desire, could be tolerated or trusted, that the
sooner such "articles" were turned into cash the better. This in
substance, was the way Jack accounted for the sudden change which had
come over his master. In defense of his course, Jack referred to the
treatment which he had received while in servitude under his old master,
in something like the following words: "I served under my young master's
father, thirty-five years, and from him received kind treatment. I was
his head man on the place, and had everything to look after."

ARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, 1857.

WILLIAM LEE, SUSAN JANE BOILE AND AMARIAN LUCRETIA RISTER.


Although these three passengers arrived in Philadelphia at the same
time, they did not come from Maryland together.



William Lee found himself under the yoke on a farm in the possession of
Zechariah Merica, who, Wm. said, was a "low ignorant man, not above a
common wood-chopper, and owned no other slave property than William."
Against him, however, William brought no accusation of any very severe
treatment; on the contrary, his master talked sometimes "as though he
wanted to be good and get religion, but said he could not while he was
trying to be rich." Everything looked hopeless in William's eyes, so far
as the master's riches and his own freedom were concerned. He concluded
that he would leave him the "bag to hold alone." William therefore laid
down "the shovel and the hoe," and, without saying a word to his master,
he took his departure, under the privacy of the night, for Canada.
William represented the white and colored races about equally; he was
about twenty-seven years of age, and looked well fitted for a full day's
work on a farm.



Susan Jane came from New Market, near Georgetown Cross-Roads, where she
had been held to unrequited labor by Hezekiah Masten, a farmer. Although
he was a man of fair pretensions, and a member of the Methodist Church,
he knew how to draw the cords very tightly, with regard to his slaves,
keeping his feet on their necks, to their sore grievance. Susan endured
his bad treatment as long as she could, then left, destitute and alone.
Her mother and father were at the time living in Elkton, Md. Whether
they ever heard what became of their daughter is not known.



Amarian was twenty-one years of age, a person of light color, medium
size, with a prepossessing countenance and smart; she could read, write,
and play on the piano. From a child, Amarian had been owned by Mrs.
Elizabeth Key Scott, who resided near Braceville, but at the time of her
flight she was living at Westminster, in the family of a man named
"Boile," said to be the clerk of the court. In reference to treatment,
Amarian said: "I have always been used very well; have had it good all
my life, etc." This was a remarkable case, and, at first, somewhat
staggered the faith of the Committee, but they could not dispute her
testimony, consequently they gave her the benefit of the doubt. She
spoke of having a mother living in Hagerstown, by the name of Amarian
Ballad, also three sisters who were slaves, and two who were free; she
also had a brother in chains in Mississippi.

ARRIVAL FROM NORFOLK, VA. 1857.

WILLIAM CARNEY AND ANDREW ALLEN.




William was about fifty-one years of age, a man of unmixed blood.
Physically he was a superior man, and his mental abilities were quite
above the average of his class.

He belonged to the estate of the late Mrs. Sarah Twyne, who bore the
reputation of being a lady of wealth, and owned one hundred and twelve
slaves. Most of her slave property was kept on her plantation not far
from Old Point Comfort. According to William's testimony "of times Mrs.
Twyne would meddle too freely with the cup, and when under its influence
she was very desperate, and acted as though she wanted to kill some of
the slaves."

After the evil spirit left her and she had regained her wonted
composure, she would pretend that she loved her "negroes," and would
make a great fuss over them. Not infrequently she would have very
serious difficulty with her overseers. Having license to do as they
pleased, they would of course carry their cruelties to the most extreme
verge of punishment. If a slave was maimed or killed under their
correction, it was no loss of theirs. "One of the overseers by the name
of Bill Anderson once shot a young slave man called Luke and wounded him
so seriously that he was not expected to live." "At another time one of
the overseers beat and kicked a slave to death." This barbarity caused
the mistress to be very much "stirred up," and she declared that she
would not have any more white overseers; condemned them for everything,
and decided to change her policy in future and to appoint her overseers
from her own slaves, setting the property to watch the property. This
system was organized and times were somewhat better.

William had been hired out almost his entire life. For the last twelve
or fifteen years he had been accustomed to hire his time for one hundred
and thirty dollars per annum. In order to meet this demand he commonly
resorted to oystering. By the hardest toil he managed to maintain
himself and family in a humble way.

For the last twenty years (prior to his escape) the slaves had
constantly been encouraged by their mistress' promises to believe that
at her death all would be free, and transported to Liberia, where they
would enjoy their liberty and be happy the remainder of their days.

With full faith in her promises year by year the slaves awaited her
demise with as much patience as possible, and often prayed that her time
might be shortened for the general good of the oppressed. Fortunately,
as the slaves thought, she had no children or near relatives to deprive
them of their just and promised rights.

In November, previous to William's escape, her long looked-for
dissolution took place. Every bondman who was old enough to realize the
nature and import of the change felt a great anxiety to learn what the
will of their old mistress said, whether she had actually freed them or
not. Alas! when the secret was disclosed, it was ascertained that not a
fetter was broken, not a bond unloosed, and that no provision whatever
had been made looking towards freedom. In this sad case, the slaves
could imagine no other fate than soon to be torn asunder and scattered.
The fact was soon made known that the High Sheriff had administered on
the estate of the late mistress; it was therefore obvious enough to
William and the more intelligent slaves that the auction block was near
at hand.

The trader, the slave-pen, the auction-block, the coffle gang, the rice
swamp, the cotton plantation, bloodhounds, and cruel overseers loomed up
before him, as they had never done before. Without stopping to consider
the danger, he immediately made up his mind that he would make a
struggle, cost what it might. He knew of no other way of escape than the
Underground Rail Road. He was shrewd enough to find an agent, who gave
him private instructions, and to whom he indicated a desire to travel
North on said road. On examination he was deemed reliable, and a mutual
understanding was entered into between. William and one of the
accommodating Captains running on the Richmond and Philadelphia Line, to
the effect that he, William, should have a first class Underground Rail
Road berth, so perfectly private that even the law-officers could not
find him.

The first ties to be severed were those which bound him to his wife and
children, and next to the Baptist Church, to which he belonged. His
family were slaves, and bore the following names: his wife, Nancy, and
children, Simon Henry, William, Sarah, Mary Ann, Elizabeth, Louis, and
Cornelius. It was no light matter to bid them farewell forever. The
separation from them was a trial such as rarely falls to the lot of
mortals; but he nerved himself for the undertaking, and when the hour
arrived his strength was sufficient for the occasion.

Thus in company with Andrew they embarked for an unknown shore, their
entire interests entrusted to a stranger who was to bring them through
difficulties and dangers seen and unseen.



Andrew was about twenty-four years of age, very tall, quite black, and
bore himself manfully. He too was of the same estate that William
belonged to. He had served on the farm as a common farm laborer. He had
had it "sometimes rough and sometimes smooth," to use his own language.
The fear of what awaited the slaves prompted Andrew to escape. He too
was entangled with a wife and one child, with whom he parted only as a
friend parts with a companion when death separates them. Catharine was
the name of Andrew's wife; and Anna Clarissa the name of his child left
in chains.

ARRIVAL FROM HOOPESVILLE, MD., 1857.

JAMES CAIN, "GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON," AND ANNA PERRY.


These passengers came from the field where as slaves very few privileges
had been afforded them.



Jim was about thirty-five years of age, a dark brown skin with average
intellect for one in his condition. He had toiled under John Burnham, in
Dorchester county, from whom he had received hard treatment, but harder
still from his mistress. He averred that she was the cause of matters
being so hard with the slaves on the place. Jim contented himself under
his lot as well as be could until within a short time of his escape when
he learned that measures were on foot to sell him. The fear of this
change brought him directly to meditate upon a trip to Canada. Being a
married man he found it hard to leave his wife, Mary, but as she was
also a slave, and kept in the employment of her owners at some distance
from where he lived, he decided to say nothing to her of his plans, but
to start when ready and do the best he could to save himself, as he saw
no chance of saving her.



"GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON." When the above "article" gave the Committee
his name they were amused and thought that he was simply jesting, having
done a smart thing in conquering his master by escaping; but on a fuller
investigation they found that he really bore the name, and meant to
retain it in Canada. It had been given him when a child, and in Slavery
he had been familiarly called "Andy," but since he had achieved his
freedom he felt bound to be called by his proper name.

General Andrew was about twenty-seven years of age, a full black, and a
man of extraordinary muscular powers, with coarse hard features, such as
showed signs that it would not be safe for his master to meddle with him
when the General's blood was up.

He spoke freely of the man who claimed him as a slave, saying that his
name was Shepherd Houston, of Lewistown, Delaware, and that he owned
seven head of "God's poor," whom he compelled to labor on his farm
without a cent of pay, a day's schooling, or an hour's freedom;
furthermore, that he was a member of the Ebenezer Methodist Church, a
class-leader, and an exhorter, and in outward show passed for a good
Christian. But in speaking of his practical dealings with his slaves,
General said that he worked them hard, stinted them shamefully for food,
and kept them all the time digging.

Also when testifying with regard to the "weaker vessel," under whose
treatment he had suffered much, the General said that his master's wife
had a meaner disposition than he had; she pretended to belong to church
too, said General, but it was nothing but deceit.

This severe critic could not read, but he had very clear views on the
ethics of his master and mistress, agreeing with Scripture concerning
whited sepulchres, etc.

The question of Christian slave-holders, for a great while, seriously
puzzled the wise and learned, but for the slave it was one of the
easiest of solution. All the slaves came to the same conclusion,
notwithstanding the teaching of slave-holders on the one idea, that
"servants should obey their masters," etc.

General had a brother in Baltimore, known by the name of Josephus, also
two sisters Anna and Annie; his father was living at Cannon's Ferry.



Anna Perry was the intended of General. She was about nineteen years of
age, of a dark brown color, and came from the same neighborhood.
According to law Anna was entitled to her freedom, but up to the time of
her escape she had not been permitted to enjoy the favor. She found that
if she would be free she would have to run for it.

John Smith. A better specimen of one who had been ill treated, and in
every way uncared for, could not be easily found. In speech, manners,
and whole appearance he was extremely rude. He was about twenty years of
age, and in color was of a very dark hue.

That John had received only the poorest kind of "corn-field fare" was
clearly evidenced both by body and mind. Master George H. Morgan was
greatly blamed for John's deficiencies; it was on his farms, under mean
overseers that John had been crushed and kept under the harrow.

His mother, Mary Smith, he stated, his master had sold away to New
Orleans, some two years before his escape. The sad effect that this
cruel separation had upon him could only be appreciated by hearing him
talk of it in his own untutored tongue. Being himself threatened with
the auction-block, he was awakened to inquire how he could escape the
danger, and very soon learned that by following the old methods which
had been used by many before him, resolution and perseverance, he might
gain the victory over master and overseers. As green as he seemed he had
succeeded admirably in his undertaking.

ARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, 1858.

GEORGE RUSSELL AND JAMES HENRY THOMPSON.


James, for convenience' sake, was supplied with two other names (Milton
Brown and John Johnson), not knowing exactly how many he would need in
freedom or which would be the best adapted to keep his whereabouts the
most completely veiled from his master.



George reported that he fled from Henry Harris, who lived near Baltimore
on the Peach Orchard Road, and that he had lived with said Harris all
his life. He spoke of him as being a "blustering man, who never liked
the slaves to make anything for themselves." George bore witness that
the usage which he had received had been hard; evidently his intellect
had been seriously injured by what he had suffered under his
task-master. George was of a very dark hue, but not quite up to medium
size.



James Henry Thompson did not accompany George, but met him at the
station in Philadelphia. He contrasted favorably with George, being
about twenty-eight years of age, with a countenance indicative of
intelligence and spirit. He was of a chestnut color and of average size.
He charged one Dennis Mannard, of Johnsonville, with being his personal
enemy as an oppressor, and added that he could "say nothing good of
him." He could say, however, that Mannard was bitterly opposed to a
slave's learning how to read, would not listen to the idea of giving
them any privileges, and tried to impress them with the idea that they
needed to know nothing but simply how to work hard for the benefit of
their masters and mistresses; in fulfilling these conditions faithfully
the end for which they had been designed would be accomplished according
to his doctrine.

Notwithstanding so much pains had been resorted to throughout the South
to impress these ideas upon the slaves, no converts were made.

James thought that the doctrine was infamous, and that it was dangerous
to live with such a man as his master; that freedom was as much his
right as it was his master's; and so he resolved to leave for Canada as
soon as he could see any chance for escape.

ARRIVAL FROM QUEEN ANN COUNTY, 1858.

CATHARINE JONES AND SON HENRY, ETNA ELIZABETH DAUPHUS, AND GEORGE NELSON
WASHINGTON.


These passengers, although interesting, and manifesting a strong desire
to be free, had no remarkable tales of personal suffering to relate;
their lot had evidently been cast among the more humane class of
slave-holders, who had acted towards their slaves with some moderation.



Catharine was twenty-four years of age, of a dark chestnut color,
possessed a fair share of mother wit, and was fitted to make a favorable
impression. In no degree whatever did she think well of slavery; she had
had, as she thought, sufficient experience under Joshua Duvall (who
professed to own her) to judge as to the good or evil of the system.
While he was by no means considered a hard man, he would now and then
buy and sell a slave. She had no fault to find with her mistress.



Etna was about twenty years of age, of a "ginger-bread" color, modest in
demeanor, and appeared to have a natural capacity for learning. She was
also from under the Duvall yoke. In setting forth her reasons for
escaping she asserted that she was tired of slavery and an unbeliever in
the doctrine that God made colored people simply to be slaves for white
people; besides, she had a strong desire to "see her friends in Canada."



George also escaped from Duvall; happily he was only about nineteen
years of age, not too old to acquire some education and do well by
himself. He was greatly elated at the prospect of freedom in Canada.



William Henry was a plump little fellow only two years of age. At the
old price (five dollars per pound) he was worth something, fat as he
was. Being in the hands of his mother, the Committee considered him a
lucky child.

ARRIVAL FROM BALTIMORE.

ELIJAH BISHOP AND WILLIAM WILLIAMSON.




Elijah represented to the Committee that he had been held under the
enthrallment of a common "gambler and drunkard," who called himself by
the name of Campbell, and carried on his sporting operations in
Baltimore.

Under this gambler Elijah had been wronged up to the age of twenty-eight
years, when he resolved to escape. Having had several opportunities of
traveling through the United States and South America with his sporting
master, he managed to pick up quite an amount of information. For the
benefit of Elijah's relatives, if any should have occasion to look for
particulars concerning this lost individual, we add, that he was a
spare-built man of a dark color.



William Williamson fled from Mrs. Rebecca Davidge, of Perrymanville. He
declared that he had been used badly--had been worked hard and had been
fed and clothed but poorly. Under such treatment he had reached his
twenty-fourth year. Being of a resolute and determined mind, and feeling
considerably galled by the burdens heaped upon him, he resolved that he
would take his chances on the Underground Rail Road. The only complaint
that he had to make against his mistress was, that she hired him to a
man named Smith, a farmer, and a slave-holder of the meanest type, in
William's opinion. For many a day William will hold her responsible for
abuses he received from him.

ARRIVAL FROM DUNWOODY COUNTY, 1858.


DARIUS HARRIS.


One of the most encouraging signs connected with the travel  _viâ_ the
Underground Rail Road was, that passengers traveling thereon were, as a
general thing, young and of determined minds. Darius, the subject of
this sketch, was only about twenty-one when he arrived. It could be seen
in his looks that he could not be kept in the prison-house unless
constantly behind bars. His large head and its formation indicated a
large brain. He stated that "Thomas H. Hamlin, a hard case, living near
Dunwoody," had professed to own him. Darius alleged that this same
Hamlin, who had thus stripped him of every cent of his earnings was
doing the same thing by sixty others, whom he held in his grasp.

With regard to "feeding and clothing" Darius set Hamlin down as "very
hoggish;" he also stated that he would sell slaves whenever he could. He
(Darius), had been hired out in Petersburg from the age of ten; for the
last three years previous to his escape he had been bringing one hundred
and fifty dollars a year into the coffers of his owners. Darius had not
been ignorant of the cruelties of the slave system up to the time of his
escape, for the fetters had been galling his young limbs for several
years; especially had the stringent slave laws given him the horrors.
Loathing the system of slavery with his whole heart, he determined to
peril his all in escaping therefrom; seeking diligently, he had found
means by which he could carry his designs into execution.

In the way of general treatment, however, Darius said that bodily he had
escaped "abuses tolerably well." He left in slavery his father and
mother, four brothers and one sister. He arrived by one of the Richmond
boats.

ARRIVED FROM ALEXANDRIA, VA., 1857.


TOWNSEND DERRIX.


The above-named escaped from a "Dutchman" by the name of Gallipappick,
who was in the confectionery business. For the credit of our German
citizens, it may be said, that slave-holders within their ranks were
very few. This was a rare case. The Committee were a little curious to
know how the German branch of civilization conducted when given
unlimited control over human beings.

In answering the requisite questions, and in making his statement,
Townsend gave entire satisfaction. His German master he spoke of as
being a tolerably fair man, "considering his origin." At least he
(Townsend), had not suffered much from him; but he spoke of a woman,
about sixty, who had been used very badly under this Dutchman. He not
only worked her very hard, but, at the same time, he would beat her over
the head, and that in the most savage manner. His mistress was also
"Dutch," a "great swabby, fat woman," with a very ill disposition.
Master and mistress were both members of the Episcopal Church. "Mistress
drank, that was the reason she was so disagreeable."

Townsend had been a married man for about seven months only. In his
effort to obtain his own freedom he sought diligently to deliver his
young wife. They were united heart and hand in the one great purpose to
reach free land, but unfortunately the pursuers were on their track; the
wife was captured and carried back, but the husband escaped. It was
particularly with a view of saving his poor wife that Townsend was
induced to peril his life, for she (the wife) was not owned by the same
party who owned Townsend, and was on the eve of being taken by her
owners some fifty miles distant into the country, where the chances for
intercourse between husband and wife would no longer be favorable.
Rather than submit to such an outrage, Townsend and his wife made the
attempt aforementioned.

ARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, 1858.


EDWARD CARROLL.


Edward, a youthful passenger about twenty-one years of age, slow of
speech, with a stammering utterance, and apparently crushed in spirits,
claimed succor and aid of the Committee. At first the Committee felt a
little puzzled to understand, how one, apparently so deficient, could
succeed in surmounting the usual difficulties consequent upon traveling,
via the Underground Rail Road; but in conversing with him, they found
him possessed of more intelligence than they had supposed; indeed, they
perceived that he could read and write a little, and that what he lacked
in aptness of speech, he supplied as a thinker, and although he was slow
he was sure. He was owned by a man named John Lewis, who also owned
about seventy head of slaves, whom he kept on farms near the mouth of
the Sassafras River, in Sussex county.

Lewis had not only held Edward in bondage, but had actually sold him,
with two of his brothers, only the Saturday before his escape, to a
Georgia trader, named Durant, who was to start south with them on the
subsequent Monday. Moved almost to desperation at their master's course
in thus selling them, the three brothers, after reflection, determined
to save themselves if possible, and without any definite knowledge of
the journey, they turned their eyes towards the North Star, and under
the cover of night they started for Pennsylvania, not knowing whether
they would ever see the goodly land of freedom. After wandering for
about two weeks, having been lost often and compelled to lie out in all
weathers, a party of pursuers suddenly came upon them. Both parties were
armed; the fugitives therefore resolved to give their enemies battle,
before surrendering. Edward felt certain that one of the pursuers
received a cut from his knife, but the extent of the injury was unknown
to him. For a time the struggle was of a very serious character; by
using his weapons skillfully, however, Edward managed to keep the
hand-cuff off of himself, but was at this point separated from his two
brothers. No further knowledge of them did he possess; nevertheless, he
trusted that they succeeded in fighting their way through to freedom.
How any were successful in making their escape under such discouraging
circumstances is a marvel.

Edward took occasion to review his master's conduct, and said that he
"could not recommend him," as he would "drink and gamble," both of
which, were enough to condemn him, in Edward's estimation, even though
he were passable in other respects. But he held him doubly guilty for
the way that he acted in selling him and his brothers.

So privately had his master transacted business with the trader, that
they were within a hair's breadth of being hand-cuffed, ere they knew
that they were sold. Probably no outrage will be remembered with
feelings of greater bitterness, than this proceeding on the part of the
master; yet, when he reflected that he was thereby prompted to strike
for freedom, Edward was disposed to rejoice at the good which had come
out of the evil.

ARRIVAL FROM PETERSBURG, 1858.


JAMES MASON.


This passenger brought rare intelligence respecting the manner in which
he had been treated in Slavery. He had been owned by a lady named Judith
Burton, who resided in Petersburg, and was a member of the Baptist
Church. She was the owner of five other slaves. James said that she had
been "the same as a mother" to him; and on the score of how he came to
escape, he said: "I left for no other cause than simply to get my
liberty." This was an exceptional case, yet he had too much sense to
continue in such a life in preference to freedom. When he fled he was
only twenty-four years of age. Had he remained, therefore, he might have
seen hard times before he reached old age; this fact he had well
considered, as he was an intelligent young man.

ARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND.


ROBERT CARR.



    $300 REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber, on the 26th
    December, 1857, Negro Man ROBERT CARR. He had on when last seen
    on West River, a close-bodied blue cloth coat with brass
    buttons, drab pantaloons, and a low crown and very narrow brim
    beaver hat; he wore a small goatee, is pleasant when spoken to,
    and very polite; about five feet ten inches high;
    copper-colored. I will give $125 if taken in Anne Arundel,
    Prince George's, Calvert or Montgomery county, $150 if taken in
    the city of Baltimore; or $300 if taken out of the State and
    secured so that I get him again.

Robert was too shrewd to be entrapped by the above reward. He sat down
and counted the cost before starting; then with his knowledge of
slaveholders when traveling he was cautious enough not to expose himself
by day or night where he was liable to danger.

He had reached the age of thirty, and despite the opposition he had had
to encounter, unaided he had learned to read, which with his good share
of native intelligence, he found of service.

Whilst Robert did not publish his mistress, he gave a plain statement of
where he was from, and why he was found in the city of Brotherly Love in
the dead of Winter in a state of destitution. He charged the blame upon
a woman, whose name was Richardson, who, he said, was quite a "fighter,
and was never satisfied, except when quarreling and fighting with some
of the slaves." He also spoke of a certain T.J. Richardson, a farmer and
a "very driving man" who was in the habit of oppressing poor men and
women by compelling them to work in his tobacco, corn, and wheat fields
without requiting them for their labor. Robert felt if he could get
justice out of said Richardson he would be the gainer to the amount of
more than a thousand dollars in money besides heavy damages for having
cheated him out of his education.

In this connection, he recalled the fact of Richardson's being a member
of the church, and in a sarcastic manner added that his "religious
pretensions might pass among slave-holders, but that it would do him no
good when meeting the Judge above." Being satisfied that he would there
meet his deserts Robert took a degree of comfort therefrom.

ARRIVAL OF A PARTY OF SIX, 1858.

PLYMOUTH CANNON, HORATIO WILKINSON, LEMUEL MITCHELL, JOSIAH MITCHELL,
GEORGE HENRY BALLARD, AND JOHN MITCHELL.


Thomas Garrett announced the coming of this party in the subjoined
letter:


    WILMINGTON, 2 MO. 5th, 1858.

    ESTEEMED FRIEND:--WILLIAM STILL:--I have information of 6
    able-bodied men that are expected here to-morrow morning; they
    may, to-morrow afternoon or evening, take the cars at Chester,
    and most likely reach the city between 11 and 12 at night; they
    will be accompanied by a colored man that has lived in
    Philadelphia and is free; they may think it safer to walk to the
    city than to go in the cars, but for fear of accident it may be
    best to have some one at the cars to look out for them. I have
    not seen them yet, and cannot certainly judge what will be best.
    I gave a man 3 dollars to bring those men 15 miles to-night, and
    I have been two miles in the country this afternoon, and gave a
    colored man 2 dollars to get provisions to feed them. Hoping all
    will be right, I remain thy friend,

    HUMANITAS.


Arriving as usual in due time these fugitives were examined, and all
found to be extra field hands.



Plymouth was forty-two years of age, of a light chestnut color, with
keen eyes, and a good countenance, and withal possessed of shrewdness
enough to lead double the number that accompanied him. He had a strong
desire to learn to read, but there was no possible way of his gaining
the light; this he felt to be a great drawback.

The name of the man who had made merchandise of Plymouth was Nat Horsey,
of Horsey's Cross Roads. The most striking characteristic in Horsey's
character, according to Plymouth's idea was, that he was very "hard to
please, did not know when a slave did enough, had no idea that they
could get tired or that they needed any privileges." He was the owner of
six slaves, was engaged in farming and mercantile pursuits, and the
postmaster of the borough in which he lived.

When Plymouth parted with his wife with a "full heart," he bade her
good-night, without intimating to her that he never expected to see her
again in this world; she evidently supposed that he was going home to
his master's place as usual, but instead he was leaving his companion
and three children to wear the yoke as hitherto. He sympathized with
them deeply, but felt that he could render them no real good by
remaining; he could neither live with his wife nor could he have any
command over one of his children. Slavery demanded all, but allowed
nothing.

Notwithstanding, Plymouth admitted that he had been treated even more
favorably than most slaves. The family thus bound consisted of his wife
Jane, and four children, as follows: Dorsey, William Francis, Mary
Ellen, and baby.



Horatio was a little in advance of Plymouth in years, being forty-four
years of age. His physical outlines gave him a commanding appearance for
one who had worn the yoke as he had for so many years. He was of a
yellow complexion, and very tall.

As a slave laborer he had been sweating and toiling to enrich a man by
the name of Thomas J. Hodgson, a farmer on a large scale, and owning
about a dozen slaves.

Horatio gave him the character of being "a man of a hidden temper," and
after the election of Buchanan he considered him a great deal worse than
ever. Horatio told of a visit which his master made to Canada, and
which, on his return, he had taken much pains to report to the slaves to
the effect that he had been there the previous summer, and saw the
country for himself, adding in words somewhat as follows: "Canada is the
meanest part of the globe that I ever found or heard of;--did not see
but one black or colored person in Canada,--inquired at the custom-house
to know what became of all the blacks from the South, and was told that
they shipped them off occasionally and sent them round Cape Horn and
sold them." In addition to this report he said that "the suffering from
deep snows and starvation was fearful," all of which Horatio believed
"to be a lie." Of course he concealed this opinion from his master. Many
such stories were sounded in the ears of slaves but without much effect.



Lemuel, John and Josiah were brothers. Lemuel was thirty-five, and might
be called a jet-black. He was uncommonly stout, with a head indicative
of determination of purpose, just suited to an Underground Rail Road
passenger. He fled from James R. Lewis, "a tall, stout man, very wealthy
and close." Lemuel said that he fed and clothed the slaves pretty well.
He had invested to the extent of twelve head. No money or privileges
were allowed, and for a small offence the threat to sell was made. It
was Lemuel's opinion that his master's wife made him worse than he
otherwise would have been.



John was twenty-four years of age, of unmixed blood, and of a quiet
demeanour. He belonged to Miss Catharine Cornwell, of Viana. John
described her as "tolerable good-looking, but real bad." His sister and
one other slave besides himself comprised her entire stock (of slaves).

According to John's story, his mistress was in the habit of telling her
slaves that she did not "intend that any of them should be free if she
could help it;" this sentiment was uttered so "scornfully" that it
"insulted" Jack very much. Indeed, it was this that put the idea of
Canada into his mind. The more she kept the idea of perpetual Slavery
before the slaves, the more Jack resolved to make her arrogance cost her
one slave at least.

Miss Cornwell was not only a warm advocate of Slavery, but was likewise
a member of the Methodist church, under the pastoral charge of the Rev.
J.C. Gregg. On one occasion, when the minister was visiting Miss C., the
subject of Slavery was introduced in John's hearing. The reverend
gentleman took the ground that it was not right to hold slaves,--said
there were none in Pennsylvania, etc. The young mistress showed little
or no sign of thinking otherwise while he remained, "but, after he was
gone, she raved and went on in a great way, and told her brother if he
(the minister), ever married her, he would have to come out of his
notions about freedom." It was John's opinion that the subject of
matrimony was then under consideration between them. For himself, he was
highly delighted with the minister's "notions of freedom," as he had
heard so many high notions of Slavery.

In reference to the labor usage under the young mistress, John said that
they had been "worked very hard, and especially last, and the present
year." "Last year," he stated, "they had hardly any meat, but were fed
chiefly on herring. Seeing that it was going to be the same thing this
year too, I thought that if I could make my escape to Canada, I would do
it." He had strong parental and kindred ties to break, but resolved to
break them rather than remain under Miss Cornwell.



Josiah was twenty-three. A more promising-looking subject to represent
the fugitives in Canada, was not readily to be found. His appearance
indicated that he was a young man of extra physical powers, at least,
one not likely to turn his face again towards Egypt.

Josiah's gain was the loss of Thomas J. Hodgson (above alluded to). For
full three years this desire and determination to be free had been in
Josiah's heart. The denial of his manhood nerved him to seek for refuge
in a foreign clime.



George, the last named in this party, gave his age as twenty-six. In
appearance he was not behind any of his comrades. He fled from a farmer,
(the late William Jackson), who owned, it was said, "sixteen head." He
had recently died, leaving all his slaves in bondage. Seeing that the
settlement of the estate might necessitate the sale of some of the
slaves, George thought that he had better not wait for the division of
the property or anything else, but push ahead with the first train for
Canada. Slavery, as he viewed it, was nothing more nor less than
downright robbery. He left his mother, one sister, and other near kin.
After George went to Canada, his heart yearned tenderly after his mother
and sister, and, as the following letter will show, he was prepared to
make commendable exertions in their behalf:


    ST. CATHARINES, JULY 19th, 1858.

    DEAR SIR:--With pleasure I now inform you that I am well, and
    hope this may find you and yours the same also. I hope kind sir
    you will please to see Mr. Paul Hammon, to know when he will try
    to get my Mother and Sister I wish him to send me word when he
    will go so I may meet him in Philadelphia.

    And I will Endevor to meet him there With some money to assist
    him in getting them. Let me know when you start for them so I
    may be able to meet you there, please after this letter passes
    from you sir, give it to John Camper tell him to give it to his
    Mother, so that my Mother can get it, be careful and not let no
    white man get hold of it. I am now living with my cousin Leven
    Parker, near Saint Catharines, $10 a month. No more at present,
    from your friend,

    GEORGE BALLARD.


The inquiry may arise, as to how such passengers managed to get through
Maryland and Delaware. But it cannot be expected that the manner in
which each arrival traveled should be particularly described. It might
not be prudent even now, to give the names of persons still living in
the South, who assisted their fellow-men in the dark days of Slavery. In
order, however, that some idea may be gathered as to the workings of one
branch of the road in Delaware (with names suppressed) we insert the
following original letter for what it may be worth.

ARRIVAL FROM RICHMOND, 1858.


EBENEZER ALLISON.


"Eb" was a bright mulatto, handsome, well-made, and barely twenty years
of age. He reported that he fled from Mr. John Tilghman Foster, a
farmer, living in the vicinity of Richmond. His master, Ebenezer
unhesitatingly declared, was a first-rate man. "I had no right to leave
him in the world, but I loved freedom better than Slavery." After fully
setting forth the kind treatment he had been accustomed to receive under
his master, a member of the Committee desired to know of him if he could
read, to which he answered that he could, but he admitted that what
knowledge he had obtained in this direction was the result of efforts
made stealthily, not through any license afforded by his master. John
Tilghman Foster held deeds for about one hundred and fifty head of
slaves, and was a man of influence.

Ebenezer had served his time in the barber's shop. On escaping he
forsook his parents, and eight brothers and sisters. As he was so
intelligent, the Committee believed he would make his mark in life some
time.

ARRIVAL FROM RICHMOND, 1858.

JOHN THOMPSON CARR, ANN MOUNTAIN AND CHILD, AND WILLIAM BOWLER.




John was a sturdy-looking chattel, but possessed far less intelligence
than the generality of passengers. He was not too old, however, to
improve. The fact that he had spirit enough to resent the harsh
treatment of one Albert Lewis, a small farmer, who claimed to own him,
showed that he was by no means a hopeless case. With all his apparent
stupidity he knew enough to give his master the name of a "free whiskey
drinker," likewise of "beating and fighting the slaves." It was on this
account that John was compelled to escape.



Ann Mountain arrived from Delaware with her child about the same time
that John did, but not in company with him; they met at the station in
Philadelphia. That Slavery had crippled her in every respect was very
discernible; this poor woman had suffered from cuffing, etc., until she
could no longer endure her oppression. Taking her child in her arms, she
sought refuge beyond the borders of slave territory. Ann was about
twenty-two years of age, her child not quite a year old. They were
considered entitled to much pity.



William was forty-one years of age, dark, ordinary size, and
intelligent. He fled from Richmond, where he had been held by Alexander
Royster, the owner of fifteen slaves, and a tobacco merchant. William
said that his master was a man of very savage temper, short, and
crabbed. As to his social relations, William said that he was "a member
of nothing now but a liquor barrel."

Knowing that his master and mistress labored under the delusion that he
was silly enough to look up to them as kind-hearted slave-holders, to
whom he should feel himself indebted for everything, William thought
that they would be sadly puzzled to conjecture what had become of him.
He was sure that they would be slow to believe that he had gone to
Canada. Until within the last five years he had enjoyed many privileges
as a slave, but he had since found it not so easy to submit to the
requirements of Slavery. He left his wife, Nancy, and two children.

ARRIVAL FROM BALTIMORE, 1858.


ROBERTA TAYLOR.


The subject of this sketch was a young mulatto woman, twenty-three years
of age, who fled from the City of Baltimore. Both before and after her
escape Roberta appeared to appreciate her situation most fully. Her
language concerning freedom had in it the ring of common sense, as had
her remarks touching her slave life.

In making her grievances known to the Committee she charged Mr. and Mrs.
McCoy with having done great violence to her freedom and degrading her
womanhood by holding her in bonds contrary to her wishes. Of Mr. McCoy,
however, she spoke less severely than she did of his "better half."
Indeed she spoke of some kind traits in his character, but said that his
wife was one of "the torn down, devilish dispositions, all the time
quarreling and fighting, and would swear like an old sailor." It was in
consequence of these evil propensities that her ladyship was intolerable
to Roberta. Without being indebted to her owners for any privileges, she
had managed to learn to read a little, which knowledge she valued highly
and meant to improve in Canada.

Roberta professed to be a Christian, and was a member of the Bethel
Methodist Church. Her servitude, until within four years of her escape,
had been passed in Virginia, under Mrs. McCoy's father, when to
accommodate the daughter she was transferred to Baltimore. Of her
parentage or relatives no note was made on the book. It was sad to see
such persons destitute and homeless, compelled to seek refuge among
strangers, not daring to ask the slightest favor, sympathy or prayer to
aid her, Christian as she was, from any Christian of Baltimore, wearing
a fair skin.

ARRIVAL FROM HIGHTSTOWN, 1858.


ROBERT THOMPSON (A PREACHER).


Slavery exempted from the yoke no man with a colored skin no matter what
his faith, talent, genius, or worth might be. The person of Christ in a
black skin would scarcely have caused it to relinquish its tyrannical
grasp; neither God nor man was regarded by men who dealt in the bodies
and souls of their fellow-men. Robert stated to the Committee that he
fled from "John R. Laten, a very harsh kind of a farmer, who drank right
smart," that on the morning he "took out," while innocent of having
committed any crime, suddenly in a desperate fit of passion, his master
took him "by the collar," at the same time calling loudly to "John" for
"ropes." This alarming assault on the part of his master made the
preacher feel as though his Satanic majesty had possession of him. In
such a crisis he evidently felt that preaching would do no good; he was,
however, constrained to make an effort. To use his own words, he said:
"I gave a sudden jerk and started off on a trot, leaving my master
calling, 'stop! stop!' but I kept on running, and was soon out of
sight."

The more he thought over the brutal conduct of his master the more
decided he became never to serve him more, and straightway he resolved
to try to reach Canada. Being in the prime of his life (thirty-nine
years of age) and having the essential qualifications for traveling over
the Underground Rail Road, he was just the man to endure the trials
consequent upon such an undertaking.

Said Robert: "I always thought slavery hard, a very dissipated life to
live. I always thought we colored people ought to work for ourselves and
wives and children like other people." The Committee saw that Robert's
views were in every word sound doctrine, and for further light asked him
some questions respecting the treatment he had received at the hands of
his mistress, not knowing but that he had received kindness from the
"weaker vessel;" while enduring suffering under his master; but Robert
assured them in answer to this inquiry that his mistress was a very
"ill, dissipated woman," and "was not calculated to sympathize with a
poor slave." Robert was next interviewed with regard to religious
matters, when it was ascertained that he bore the name of being a "local
preacher of the gospel of the Bethel Methodist denomination." Thus in
leaving slavery he had to forsake his wife and three children, kinfolks
and church, which arduous task but for the brutal conduct of the master
he might have labored in vain for strength to perform.

As he looked calmly back upon the past, and saw how he and the rest of
the slaves had been deprived of their just rights he could hardly
realize how Providence could suffer slave-holders to do as they had been
doing in trampling upon the poor and helpless slaves. Yet he had strong
faith that the Almighty would punish slave-holders severely for their
wickedness.

ARRIVAL FROM VIRGINIA, 1858.


ALFRED S. THORNTON.


The subject of this sketch was a young man about twenty-two years of
age, of dark color, but bright intellectually. Alfred found no fault
with the ordinary treatment received at the hands of his master; he had
evidently been on unusually intimate terms with him. Nor was any fault
found with his mistress, so far as her treatment of him was concerned;
thus, comparatively, he was "happy and contented," little dreaming of
trader or a change of owners. One day, to his utter surprise, he saw a
trader with a constable approaching him. As they drew nearer and nearer
he began to grow nervous. What further took place will be given, as
nearly as possible, in Alfred's own words as follows:


    "William Noland (a constable), and the trader was making right
    up to me almost on my heels, and grabbed at me, they were so
    near. I flew, I took off-my hat and run, took off my jacket and
    run harder, took off my vest and doubled my pace, the constable
    and the trader both on the chase hot foot. The trader fired two
    barrels of his revolver after me, and cried out as loud as he
    could call, G----d d----n, etc., but I never stopped running,
    but run for my master. Coming up to him, I cried out, Lord,
    master, have you sold me? 'Yes,' was his answer. 'To the
    trader,' I said. 'Yes,' he answered. 'Why couldn't you sold me
    to some of the neighbors?' I said. 'I don't know,' he said, in a
    dry way. With my arms around my master's neck, I begged and
    prayed him to tell me why he had sold me. The trader and
    constable was again pretty near. I let go my master and took to
    my heels to save me. I run about a mile off and run into a mill
    dam up to my head in water. I kept my head just above and hid
    the rest part of my body for more than two hours. I had not made
    up my mind to escape until I had got into the water. I run only
    to have little more time to breathe before going to Georgia or
    New Orleans; but I pretty soon made up my mind in the water to
    try and get to a free State, and go to Canada and make the trial
    anyhow, but I didn't know which way to travel."


Such great changes in Alfred's prospects having been wrought in so short
a while, together with such a fearful looking-for of a fate in the far
South more horrid than death, suddenly, as by a miracle, he turns his
face in the direction of the North. But the North star, as it were, hid
its face from him. For a week he was trying to reach free soil, the rain
scarcely ceasing for an hour. The entire journey was extremely
discouraging, and many steps had to be taken in vain, hungry and weary.
But having the faith of those spoken of in the Scriptures, who wandered
about in dens and caves of the earth, being destitute, afflicted and
tormented, he endured to the end and arrived safely to the Committee.

[Illustration: ]

He left his father and mother, both slaves, living near Middleburg, in
Virginia, not far from where he said his master lived, who went by the
name of C.E. Shinn, and followed farming. His master and mistress were
said to be members of the "South Baptist Church," and both had borne
good characters until within a year or so previous to Alfred's
departure. Since then a very serious disagreement had taken place
between them, resulting in their separation, a heavy lawsuit, and
consequently large outlays. It was this domestic trouble, in Alfred's
opinion, that rendered his sale indispensable. Of the merits of the
grave charges made by his master against his mistress, Alfred professed
to have formed no opinion; he knew, however, that his master blamed a
school-master, by the name of Conway, for the sad state of things in his
household. Time would fail to tell of the abundant joy Alfred derived
from the fact, that his "heels" had saved him from a Southern market.
Equally difficult would it be to express the interest felt by the
Committee in this passenger and his wonderful hair-breadth escape.

ARRIVAL FROM BELLEAIR.

JULIUS SMITH, WIFE MARY, AND BOY JAMES, HENRY AND EDWARD SMITH, AND JACK
CHRISTY.


While this party was very respectable in regard to numbers and enlisted
much sympathy, still they had no wounds or bruises to exhibit, or very
hard reports to make relative to their bondage. The treatment that had
been meted out to them was about as tolerant as Slavery could well
afford; and the physical condition of the passengers bore evidence that
they had been used to something better than herring and corn cake for a
diet.



Julius, who was successful enough to bring his wife and boy with him,
was a wonderful specimen of muscular proportions. Although a young man,
of but twenty-five, he weighed two hundred and twenty-five pounds; he
was tall and well-formed from the crown of his head to the soles of his
feet. Nor was he all muscle by a great deal; he was well balanced as to
mother wit and shrewdness.

In looking back into the pit from whence he had been delivered he could
tell a very interesting story of what he had experienced, from which it
was evident that he had not been an idle observer of what had passed
relative to the Peculiar Institution; especially was it very certain
that he had never seen anything lovely or of good report belonging to
the system. So far as his personal relations were concerned, he
acknowledged that a man named Mr. Robert Hollan, had assumed to impose
himself upon him as master, and that this same man had also wrongfully
claimed all his time, denied him all common and special privileges;
besides he had deprived him of an education, etc., which looked badly
enough before he left Maryland, but in the light of freedom, and from a
free State stand-point, the idea that "man's inhumanity to man" should
assume such gigantic proportions as to cause him to seize his fellow-man
and hold him in perpetual bondage, was marvellous in the extreme.

Julius had been kept in the dark in Maryland, but on free soil, the
light rushed in upon his astonished vision to a degree almost
bewildering. That his master was a man of "means and pretty high
standing"--Julius thought was not much to his credit since they were
obtained from unpaid labor. In his review allusion was made not only to
his master, but also to his mistress, in which he said that she was "a
quarrelsome and crabbed woman, middling stout." In order to show a
reason why he left as he did, he stated that "there had been a fuss two
or three times" previous to the escape, and it had been rumored "that
somebody would have to be sold soon." This was what did the mischief so
far as the "running away" was concerned. Julius' color was nearly jet
black, and his speech was very good considering his lack of book
learning; his bearing was entirely self-possessed and commendable.



His wife and boy shared fully in his affections, and seemed well pleased
to have their faces turned Canada-ward. It is hardly necessary to say
more of them here.



Henry was about twenty-three years of age, of an active turn, brown
skin, and had given the question of freedom his most serious attention,
as his actions proved. While he could neither read nor write, he could
think. From the manner in which he expressed himself, with regard to
Robert Hollan, no man in the whole range of his recollections will be
longer remembered than he; his enthralment while under Hollan will
hardly ever be forgotten. Any being who had been thus deprived of his
rights, could hardly fail to command sympathy; in cases like this,
however, the sight and language of such an one was extremely impressive.



Of this party, Edward, a boy of seventeen, called forth much sympathy;
he too was claimed by Hollan. He was of a good physical make-up, and
seemed to value highly the great end he had in view, namely, a residence
in Canada.

ARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, 1858.

JOHN WESLEY COMBASH, JACOB TAYLOR, AND THOMAS EDWARD SKINNER.


The revelations made by these passengers were painful to listen to, and
would not have been credited if any room had existed for doubt.



John Wesley was thirty-two years of age, of a lively turn, pleasant
countenance, dark color, and ordinary size. In unburdening his mind to
the Committee the all-absorbing theme related to the manner in which he
had been treated as a slave, and the character of those who had
oppressed him. He stated that he had been the victim of a man or party,
named Johnson, in whose family John had been a witness to some of the
most high-handed phases of barbarism; said he, "these Johnsons were
notorious for abusing their servants. A few years back one of their
slaves, a coachman, was kept on the coach box one cold night when they
were out at a ball until he became almost frozen to death, in fact he
did die in the infirmary from the effects of the frost about one week
afterwards."

"Another case was that of a slave woman in a very delicate state, who
was one day knocked down stairs by Mrs. Johnson herself, and in a few
weeks after, the poor woman died from the effects of the injury thus
received. The doctor who attended the injured creature in this case was
simply told that she slipped and fell down stairs as she was coming
down. Colored witnesses had no right to testify, and the doctor was
mute, consequently the guilty escaped wholly unpunished." "Another
case," said John Wesley, "was a little girl, half-grown, who was washing
windows up stairs one day, and unluckily fell asleep in the window, and
in this position was found by her mistress; in a rage the mistress hit
her a heavy slap, knocked her out of the window, and she fell to the
pavement, and died in a few hours from the effects thereof. The mistress
professed to know nothing about it, simply said, 'she went to sleep and
fell out herself.' As usual nothing was done in the way of punishment."

These were specimens of the inner workings of the peculiar institution.
John, however, had not only observed Slavery from a domestic
stand-point, he had also watched master and mistress abroad as visitors
and guests in other people's houses, noticed not only how they treated
white people, but also how they treated black people. "These Johnsons
thought that they were first-rate to their servants. When visiting among
their friends they were usually very polite, would bow and scrape more
than a little, even to colored people, knowing that their names were in
bad odor, on account of their cruelty, for they had been in the papers
twice about how they abused their colored people."

As to advertising him, John gave it as his opinion that they would be
ashamed to do it from the fact that they had already rendered themselves
more notorious than they had bargained for, on account of their cruelty
towards their slaves; they were wealthy, and courted the good opinion of
society. Besides they were members of the Presbyterian Church, and John
thought that they were very willing that people should believe that they
were great saints. On the score of feeding and clothing John gave them
credit, saying that "the clothing was good enough, they liked to see the
house servants dressed;" he spoke too of the eating as being all right,
but added, that "very often time was not allowed them to finish their
meals." Respecting work, John bore witness that they were very sharp.

With John's intelligence, large observation, good memory, and excellent
natural abilities, with the amount of detail that he possessed, nothing
more would have been needed for a thrilling book than the facts and
incidents of slave life, as he had been conversant with it under the
Johnsons in Maryland.

As the other two companions of John Wesley were advertised in the
_Baltimore Sun_, we avail ourselves of the light thus publicly afforded:


    $2000 REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber, living on the York
    Turnpike, eight miles from Baltimore city, on Sunday, April
    11th, my negro man, JACOB, aged 20 years: 5 feet 10 inches high;
    chestnut color; spare made; good features. I will give $50
    reward if taken in Baltimore city or county, and $200 if taken
    out of the State and secured in jail so that I get him again.

    a13-3t*||


"Jacob," answering to the description in Mr. Wm. J.B. Parlett's
advertisement, gave his views of the man who had enslaved him. His
statement is here transferred from the record book: "My master," said
Jacob, "was a farmer, a very rough man, hard to satisfy. I never knew of
but one man who could ever please him. He worked me very hard; he wanted
to be beating me all the time." This was a luxury which Jacob had no
appetite for, consequently he could not resist signifying his
unwillingness to yield, although resistance had to be made at some
personal risk, as his master had "no more regard for a colored man than
he had for a stone under his feet." With him the following expression
was common: "The niggers are not worth a d----n." Nor was his wife any
better, in Jacob's opinion. "She was a cross woman, and as much of a
boss as he was." "She would take a club and with both hands would whack
away as long as you would stand it." "She was a large, homely woman;
they were common white people, with no reputation in the community."
Substantially this was Jacob's unvarnished description of his master and
mistress.

As to his age, and also the name of his master, Jacob's statement varied
somewhat from the advertisement. For instance, Jacob Taylor was noticed
on the record book as being twenty-three years of age, and the name of
his master was entered as "William Pollit;" but as Jacob had never been
allowed to learn to read, he might have failed in giving a correct
pronunciation of the name.

When asked what first prompted him to seek his freedom, he replied, "Oh
my senses! I always had it in my mind to leave, but I was 'jubus',
(dubious?) of starting. I didn't know the way to come. I was afraid of
being overtaken on the way." He fled from near Baltimore, where he left
brothers and other relatives in chains.


    $20 REWARD.--Ran way at the same time and in company with the
    above negro man, a bright mulatto boy named THOMAS SKINNER,
    about 18 years old, 5 feet 8 inches high and tolerable stout
    made; he only has a term of years to serve. I will pay $20
    reward if delivered to me or lodged in jail so I can get him
    again.

About the same time that this advertisement came to hand a certain young
aspirant for Canada was entered on the Underground Rail Road Book thus:
"THOMAS EDWARD SKINNER, a bright mulatto, age eighteen years, well
formed, good-looking, and wide awake; says, that he fled from one G.H.
Carman, Esq., head Clerk of the County Court." He bore voluntary
testimony to Carman in the following words: "He was a very good man; he
fed and clothed well and gave some money too occasionally." Yet Thomas
had no idea of remaining in Slavery under any circumstances. He hated
everything like Slavery, and as young as he was, he had already made
five attempts to escape. On this occasion, with older and wiser heads,
he succeeded.

ARRIVAL FROM NEW MARKET, 1858.


ELIJAH SHAW.


This "article" reported himself as having been deprived of his liberty
by Dr. Ephraim Bell, of Baltimore County, Maryland. He had no fault to
find with the doctor, however; on the contrary, he spoke of him as a
"very clever and nice man, as much so as anybody need to live with;" but
of his wife he could not speak so favorably; indeed, he described her as
a most tyrannical woman. Said Elijah, "she would make a practice of
rapping the broomstick around the heads of either men, women, or
children when she got raised, which was pretty often. But she never
rapped me, for I wouldn't stand it; I shouldn't fared any better than
the rest if I hadn't been resolute. I declared over and over again to
her that I would scald her with the tea kettle if she ever took the
broomstick to me, and I meant it. She took good care to keep the
broomstick from about my head. She was as mischievous and stingy as she
could live; wouldn't give enough to eat or wear." These facts and many
more were elicited from Elijah, when in a calm state of mind and when
feeling much elated with the idea that his efforts in casting off the
yoke were met with favor by the Committee, and that the accommodations
and privileges on the road were so much greater than he had ever dreamed
of. Such luck on the road was indeed a matter of wonder and delight to
passengers generally. They were delighted to find that the Committee
received them and forwarded them on "without money and without price."
Elijah was capable of realizing the worth of such friendship. He was a
young man twenty-three years of age, spare made, yellow complexion, of
quick motion and decidedly collected in his bearing. In short, he was a
man well adapted to make a good British subject.



ARRIVAL FROM VIRGINIA, 1858.

MARY FRANCES MELVIN, ELIZA HENDERSON, AND NANCY GRANTHAM.




Mary Frances hailed from Norfolk; she had been in servitude under Mrs.
Chapman, a widow lady, against whom she had no complaint to make;
indeed, she testified that her mistress was very kind, although fully
allied to slavery. She said that she left, not on account of bad
treatment, but simply because she wanted her freedom. Her calling as a
slave had been that of a dress-maker and house servant. Mary Frances was
about twenty-three years of age, of mixed blood, refined in her manners
and somewhat cultivated.



Eliza Henderson, who happened at the station at the same time that
Frances was on hand, escaped from Richmond. She was twenty-eight years
of age, medium size, quite dark color, and of pleasant countenance.
Eliza alleged that one William Waverton had been wronging her by keeping
her down-trodden and withholding her hire. Also, that this same Waverton
had, on a late occasion, brought his heavy fist violently against her
"jaws," which visitation, however "kindly" intended by her chivalrous
master, produced such an unfavorable impression on the mind of Eliza
that she at once determined not to yield submission to him a day longer
than she could find an Underground Rail Road conductor who would take
her North.

The blow that she had thus received made her almost frantic; she had
however thought seriously on the question of her rights before this
outrage.

In Waverton's household Eliza had become a fixture as it were,
especially with regard to his children; she had won their affections
completely, and she was under the impression that in some instances
their influence had saved her from severe punishment; and for them she
manifested kindly feelings. In speaking of her mistress she said that
she was "only tolerable."

It would be useless to attempt a description of the great satisfaction
and delight evinced by Eliza on reaching the Committee in Philadelphia.

Nancy Grantham also fled from near Richmond, and was fortunate in that
she escaped from the prison-house at the age of nineteen. She possessed
a countenance peculiarly mild, and was good-looking and interesting, and
although evidently a slave her father belonged strictly to the white
man's party, for she was fully half white. She was moved to escape
simply to shun her master's evil designs; his brutal purposes were only
frustrated by the utmost resolution. This chivalric gentleman was a
husband, the father of nine children, and the owner of three hundred
slaves. He belonged to a family bearing the name of Christian, and was
said to be an M.D. "He was an old man, but very cruel to all his
slaves." It was said that Nancy's sister was the object of his lust, but
she resisted, and the result was that she was sold to New Orleans. The
auction-block was not the only punishment she was called upon to endure
for her fidelity to her womanhood, for resistance to her master, but
before being sold she was cruelly scourged.

Nancy's sorrows first commenced in Alabama. Five years previous to her
escape she was brought from a cotton plantation in Alabama, where she
had been accustomed to toil in the cotton-field. In comparing and
contrasting the usages of slave-holders in the two States in which she
had served, she said she had "seen more flogging under old Christian"
than she had been accustomed to see in Alabama; yet she concluded, that
she could hardly tell which State was the worst; her cup had been full
and very bitter in both States.

Nancy said, "the very day before I escaped, I was required to go to his
(her master's) bed-chamber to keep the flies off of him as he lay sick,
or pretended to be so. Notwithstanding, in talking with me, he said that
he was coming to my pallet that night, and with an oath he declared if I
made a noise he would cut my throat. I told him I would not be there.
Accordingly he did go to my room, but I had gone for shelter to another
room. At this his wrath waxed terrible. Next morning I was called to
account for getting out of his way, and I was beaten awfully." This
outrage moved Nancy to a death-struggle for her freedom, and she
succeeded by dressing herself in male attire.

After her harrowing story was told with so much earnestness and
intelligence, she was asked as to the treatment she had received at the
hand of Mrs. Christian (her mistress). In relation to her, Nancy said,
"Mrs. Christian was afraid of him (master); if it hadn't been for that I
think she would have been clever; but I was often threatened by her, and
once she undertook to beat me, but I could not stand it. I had to
resist, and she got the worst of it that time."

All that may now be added, is, that the number of young slave girls
shamefully exposed to the base lusts of their masters, as Nancy
was--truly was legion. Nancy was but one of the number who resisted
influences apparently overpowering. All honor is due her name and
memory!

She was brought away secreted on a boat, but the record is silent as to
which one of the two or three Underground Rail Road captains (who at
that time occasionally brought passengers), helped her to escape. It was
hard to be definite concerning minor matters while absorbed in the
painful reflections that her tale of suffering had naturally awakened.
If one had arisen from the dead the horrors of Slavery could scarcely
have been more vividly pictured! But in the multitude of travelers
coming under the notice of the Committee, Nancy's story was soon
forgotten, and new and marvellous narratives were told of others who had
shared the same bitter cup, who had escaped from the same hell of
Slavery, who had panted for the same freedom and won the same prize.



ARRIVAL FROM RICHMOND, 1858.


ORLANDO J. HUNT.


When Orlando escaped from Richmond the Underground Rail Road business
was not very brisk. A disaster on the road, resulting in the capture of
one or two captains, tended to damp the ardor of some who wanted to
come, as well as that of sympathizers. The road was not idle, however.
Orlando's coming was hailed with great satisfaction. He was twenty-nine
years of age, full black, possessed considerable intelligence, and was
fluent in speech; fully qualified to give clear statements as to the
condition of Slavery in Richmond, etc. While the Committee listened to
his narrations with much interest, they only took note of how he had
fared, and the character of the master he was compelled to serve. On
these points the substance of his narrations may be found annexed:

"I was owned by High Holser, a hide sorter, a man said to be rich, a
good Catholic, though very disagreeable; he was not cruel, but was very
driving and abusive in his language towards colored people. I have been
held in bondage about eighteen years by Holser, but have failed, so far,
to find any good traits in his character. I purchased my mother for one
hundred dollars, when she was old and past labor, too old to earn her
hire and find herself; but she was taken away by death, before I had
finished paying for her; twenty-five dollars only remained to be paid to
finish the agreement. Owing to her unexpected death, I got rid of that
much, which was of some consequence, as I was a slave myself, and had
hard work to raise the money to purchase her."

Thus, finding the usages of Slavery so cruel and outlandish, he resolved
to leave "old Virginny" and "took out," via the Underground Rail Road.
He appeared to be of a religious turn of mind and felt that he had "a
call to preach."

After his arrival in Canada, the following letter was received from him:


    ST. CATHARINES, C.W., May 6th, 1858.

    MY DEAR FRIEND:--WM. STILL:--Mr. Orlando J. Hunt, who has just
    arrived here from Richmond, Va., desires me to address to you a
    line in his behalf. Mr. Hunt is expecting his clothing to come
    from Richmond to your care, and if you have received them, he
    desires you to forward them immediately to St. Catharines, in my
    care, in the safest and most expeditious way in your power. Mr.
    Hunt is much pleased with this land of freedom, and I hope he
    may do well for himself and much good to others. He preached
    here in the Baptist church, last evening.

    He sends his kind regards and sincere thanks to you and your
    family, and such friends as have favored him on his way. Very
    respectfully yours,

    HIRAM WILSON, for ORLANDO HUNT.

ARRIVAL FROM NORFOLK, VA., 1858.


WILLIAM MACKEY.


William made no complaint against his master of a serious nature
touching himself. True, he said his "master was a frolicker, and fond of
drink," but he was not particularly unkind to him. His name was Tunis;
he was a military man, and young; consequently William had not been in
his hands long. Prior to his being owned by the young master, he had
lived with old mistress Tunis. Concerning her the following is one of
William's statements:

"My sister about the first of this month, three weeks after her
confinement, had word sent to her by her mistress, Mrs. Tunis, that she
thought it was time for her to come out and go to work, as she had been
laying by long enough." In reply to this message, William said that "his
sister sent word to her mistress, that she was not well enough, and
begged that her mistress would please send her some tea and sugar, until
she got well enough to go to work. The mistress' answer was to the
effect that she did not intend to give her anything until she went to
work, and at the same time she sent word to her, that she had better
take her baby down to the back of the garden and throw it away, adding
'I will sell her, etc.'"

It was owing to the cruelty of Mrs. Tunis that William was moved to
flee. According to his statement, which looked reasonable and appeared
truthful, he had been willed free by his master, who died at the time
that the plague was raging in Norfolk. At the same time his mistress
also had the fever, and was dreadfully frightened, but recovered. Not
long after this event it was William's belief that the will was made
away with through the agency of a lawyer, and in consequence thereof the
slaves were retained in bondage.

ARRIVAL FROM NEAR BALTIMORE, 1858.


HENRY TUCKER.


Henry fled from Baltimore county; disagreement between him and his
so-called master was the cause of his flight. Elias Sneveley, a farmer,
known on the Arabella Creek Place as a "hard swearer," an "old
bachelor," and a common tormentor of all around him, was the name of the
man that Harry said he fled from. Not willing to be run over at the
pleasure of Sneveley, on two occasions just before his escape serious
encounters had arisen between master and slave.

Henry being spirited and hungering for freedom, while his master was old
and hardened in his habits, very grave results had well nigh happened;
it was evident, therefore, in Harry's opinion that the sooner he took
his departure for Canada the better. His father's example was ever
present to encourage him, for he had escaped when Henry was a little
boy; (his name was Benjamin Tucker). A still greater incentive, however,
moved him, which was that his mother had been sold South five years
prior to his escape, since which time he had heard of her but once, and
that vaguely.

Although education was denied him, Henry had too much natural ability to
content himself under the heel of Slavery. He saw and understood the
extent of the wrongs under which he suffered, and resolved not to abide
in such a condition, if, by struggling and perseverance, he could avoid
it. In his resolute attempt he succeeded without any very severe
suffering. He was not large, rather below the ordinary size, of a brown
color, and very plucky.

ARRIVAL FROM VIRGINIA, 1858.


PETER NELSON. (RESEMBLED AN IRISHMAN.)


The coming of this strange-looking individual caused much surprise,
representing, as he did, if not a full-blooded Irishman, a man of Irish
descent. He was sufficiently fair to pass for white anywhere, with his
hat on--with it off, his hair would have betrayed him; it was light, but
quite woolly. Nor was he likely to be called handsome; he was
interesting, nevertheless. It was evident, that the "white man's party"
had damaged him seriously. He represented that he had been in the bonds
of one James Ford, of Stafford county, Virginia, and that this "Ford was
a right tough old fellow, who owned about two dozen head." "How does he
treat them?" he was asked. "He don't treat them well no way," replied
the passenger. "Why did you leave?" was the next question. "Because of
his fighting, knocking and carrying on so," was the prompt answer. The
Committee fully interviewed him, and perceived that he had really worn
the fetters of Slavery, and that he was justified in breaking his bonds
and fleeing for refuge to Canada, and was entitled to aid and sympathy.
Peter was about twenty-four years of age. He left nine brothers and
sisters in bondage.

ARRIVAL FROM WASHINGTON, 1858.


MARY JONES AND SUSAN BELL.


These "weaker vessels" came from the seat of government. Mary confessed
that she had been held to service as the property of Mrs. Henry Harding,
who resided at Rockville, some miles out of Washington. Both Mr. and Mrs
Harding she considered "bad enough," but added, "if it had not been for
the young set I could get along with them; they can't be pleased." Yet
Mary had not fared half so hard under the Hardings as many slaves had
under their claimants. Intellectually, she was quite above the average;
she was tall, and her appearance was such as to awaken sympathy. Through
the permission of her claimant she had been in the habit of hiring her
time for three dollars per month and find herself; she was also allowed
to live in Washington. Such privileges, with wages at so low a rate,
were thought to be extra, and could only be obtained in exceptional
cases.

"In nine years," said Mary, "I have not even as much as received an
apron from them," (her owners). The meanness of the system under which
she had been required to live, hourly appeared clearer and clearer to
her, as she was brought into contact with sympathizing spirits such as
she had never known before.

Susan, who was in Mary's charge, was an invalid child of four years of
age, who never walked, and whose mother had escaped to Canada about
three years before under circumstances which obliged her to leave this
child, then only a year old.

Susan had been a great sufferer, and so had her mother, who had been a
long time anxiously looking and praying for her coming, as she had left
her in charge of friends who were to take care of her until the way
might open for her safe delivery to her mother. Many letters, fitted to
awaken very deep feelings came from the mother about this child. It was
a satisfaction to the Committee to feel that they could be the medium in
aiding in the reunion of mother and child.

ARRIVAL FROM VIRGINIA, 1858.


WILLIAM CARPENTER.


Escaped from the Father of the Fugitive Slave Law--Senator Mason.

It was highly pleasing to have a visit from a "chattel" belonging to the
leading advocate of the infamous Fugitive Slave Bill. He was hurriedly
interviewed for the sake of reliable information.

That William possessed a fair knowledge of slave life under the Senator
there was no room to doubt, although incidents of extreme cruelty might
not have been so common on Mason's place as on some others. While the
verbal interchange of views was quite full, the hour for the starting of
the Underground Rail Road train arrived too soon to admit of a full
report for the record book. From the original record, however, the
following statement is taken as made by William, and believed to be
strictly true. We give it as it stands on the old Underground Rail Road
book: "I belonged to Senator Mason. The Senator was down on colored
people. He owned about eighty head--was very rich and a big man, rich
enough to lose all of them. He kept terrible overseers; they would beat
you with a stick the same as a dog. The overseers were poor white trash;
he would give them about sixty dollars a year."

The Fugitive Slave Law and its Father are both numbered with the "Lost
Cause," and the "Year of Jubilee has come."

ARRIVAL FROM THE OLD DOMINION.


NINE VERY FINE "ARTICLES." LEW JONES, OSCAR PAYNE, MOSE WOOD, DAVE
DIGGS, JACK, HEN, AND BILL DADE, AND JOE BALL.


The coming of this interesting party was as gratifying, as their
departure must have been disagreeable to those who had been enjoying the
fruits of their unpaid labor. Stockholders of the Underground Rail Road,
conductors, etc., about this time were well pleased with the wonderful
success of the road, especially as business was daily increasing.

Upon inquiry of these passengers individually, the following results
were obtained:



Lewis was about fifty-two years of age, a man of superior stature, six
feet high, with prominent features, and about one third of Anglo-Saxon
blood in his veins. The apparent solidity of the man both with respect
to body and mind was calculated to inspire the idea that he would be a
first-rate man to manage a farm in Canada.

Of his bondage and escape the following statement was obtained from him:
"I was owned by a man named Thomas Sydan, a Catholic, and a farmer. He
was not a very hard man, but was very much opposed to black folks having
their liberty. He owned six young slaves not grown up. It was owing to
Sydan's mother's estate that I came into his hands; before her death I
had hoped to be free for a long time as soon as she died. My old
mistress' name was Nancy Sydan; she was lame for twenty years, and
couldn't walk a step without crutches, and I was her main support. I was
foreman on the farm; sometimes no body but me would work, and I was
looked up to for support. A good deal of the time I would have to attend
to her. If she was going to ride, I would have to pick her up in my arms
and put her in the carriage, and many times I would have to lift her in
her sick room. No body couldn't wait upon her but me. She had a husband,
and he had a master, and that was rum; he drank very hard, he killed
himself drinking. He was poor support. When he died, fifteen years ago,
he left three sons, Thomas, James, and Stephen, they were all together
then, only common livers. After his death about six years mistress died.
I felt sure then I would be free, but was very badly disappointed. I
went to my young masters and asked them about my freedom; they laughed
at me and said, no such thought had entered their heads, that I was to
be free. The neighbors said it was a shame that they should keep me out
of my freedom, after I had been the making of the family, and had
behaved myself so faithful. One gentleman asked master John what he
would take for me, and offered a thousand dollars; that was three months
before I ran away, and massa John said a thousand dollars wouldn't buy
one leg. I hadn't anything to hope for from them. I served them all my
life, and they didn't thank me for it. A short time before I come away
my aunt died, all the kin I had, and they wouldn't let me go to the
funeral. They said 'the time couldn't be spared.'" This was the last
straw on the camel's back.

In Lewis' grief and disappointment he decided that he would run away the
first chance that he could get, and seek a home in Canada. He held
counsel with others in whom he could confide, and they fixed on a time
to start, and resolved that they would suffer anything else but Slavery.
Lewis was delighted that he had managed so cunningly to leave master Tom
and mistress Margaret, and their six children to work for their own
living. He had an idea that they would want Lew for many things; the
only regret he felt was that he had served them so long, that they had
received his substance and strength for half a century. Fortunately
Lewis' wife escaped three days in advance of him, in accordance with a
mutual understanding. They had no children. The suffering on the road
cost Lewis a little less than death, but the joy of success came soon to
chase away the effects of the pain and hardship which had been endured.



Oscar, the next passenger, was advertised as follows:


    $200 REWARD.--Ran away from the service of the Rev. J.P.
    McGuire, Episcopal High School, Fairfax county, Va., on
    Saturday, 10th inst, Negro Man, Oscar Payne aged 30 years, 5
    feet 4 inches in height, square built, mulatto color, thick,
    bushy suit of hair, round, full face, and when spoken to has a
    pleasant manner--clothes not recollected.

    [Illustration: ]

    I will give $200 for his recovery if taken out of the State, or
    $150 if taken in the State, and secured that I can get him.

    T.D. FENDALL.

    jyl7-6t.


Such announcements never frightened the Underground Rail Road Committee;
indeed, the Committee rather preferred seeing the names of their
passengers in the papers, as, in that case, they could all the more
cautiously provide against Messrs. slave-hunters. Oscar was a "prime,
first-class article," worth $1800. The above description of him is
endorsed. His story ran thus:

"I have served under Miss Mary Dade, of Alexandria--Miss Dade was a very
clever mistress, she hired me out. When I left I was hired at the
school--High School of Virginia. With me times had been very well. No
privilege was allowed me to study books. I cannot say that I left for
any other cause than to get my freedom, as I believe I have been used as
well as any slave in the District. I left no relatives but two cousins;
my two brothers ran away, Brooks and Lawrence, but where they went I
can't tell, but would be pleased to know. Three brothers and one sister
have been sold South, can't tell where they are." Such was Oscar's brief
narrative; that he was truthful there was no room to doubt.



The next passenger was MOSES or "Mose," who looked as though he had been
exceedingly well-cared for, being plump, fat, and extra-smart. He
declared that General Briscoe, of Georgetown, D.C., had been defrauding
him out of thirteen dollars per month, this being the amount for which
he was hired, and, instead of being allowed to draw it for himself, the
general pocketed it. For this "kind treatment" he summed up what seemed
to be a true bill for ten years against the general. But he made another
charge of a still graver character: he said that the general professed
to own him. But as he (Moses) was thoroughly tired, and believed that
Slavery was no more justifiable than murder, he made up his mind to
leave and join the union party for Canada. He stated that the general
owned a large number of slaves, which he hired out principally. Moses
had no special fault to find with his master, except such as have been
alluded to, but as to mistress Briscoe, he said, that she was pretty
rough. Moses left four sisters in bondage.



David, the next member of this freedom-loving band, was an intelligent
man; his manners and movements were decidedly prepossessing. He was
about thirty-seven years of age, dark, tall, and rather of a slender
stature, possessing very large hopes. He charged Dr. Josiah Harding of
Rockville, Montgomery county, with having enslaved him contrary to his
wish or will.

As a slave, David had been required at one time to work on a farm, and
at another time to drive carriage, of course, without pay. Again he had
been bound as a waiter on the no pay system, and again he had been
called into the kitchen to cook, all for the benefit of the Doctor--the
hire going into the Dr.'s pocket. This business David protested against
in secret, but when on the Underground Rail Road his protestations were
"over and above board."

Of the Doctor, David said, that "he was clever, but a Catholic;" he also
said, that he thought his wife was "tolerable clever," although he had
never been placed under her where he would have had an opportunity of
learning her bad traits if she had any.

The Doctor had generously bargained with David, that he could have
himself by paying $1000; he had likewise figured up how the money might
be paid, and intimated what a nice thing it would be for "Dave" to wake
up some morning and find himself his own man. This was how it was to be
accomplished: Dave was to pay eighty-five dollars annually, and in about
twelve years he would have the thousand, and a little over, all made up.
On this principle and suggestion Dave had been digging faithfully and
hard, and with the aid of friends he had nearly succeeded. Just when he
was within sight of the grand prize, and just as the last payment was
about to be made, to Dave's utter surprise the Doctor got very angry one
day about some trifling matter (all pretension) and in his pretended
rage he said there were too many "free niggers" going about, and he
thought that Dave would do better as a slave, etc.

After that, all the satisfaction that he was able to get out of the
Doctor, was simply to the effect, that he had hired him to Mr. Morrison
for one hundred and fifty dollars a year. After his "lying and cheating"
in this way, David resolved that he would take his chances on the
Underground Rail Road. Not a spark of faith did he have in the Doctor.
For a time, however, before the opportunity to escape offered, he went
to Mr. Morrison as a waiter, where it was his province to wait on six of
the Judges of the Supreme Court of the United States. In the meantime
his party matured arrangements for their trip, so Dave "took out" and
left the Judges without a waiter. The more he reflected over the nature
of the wrongs he had suffered under, the less he thought of the Doctor.



Joe, who also came with this band, was half Anglo-Saxon; an able-bodied
man, thirty-four years of age. He said, that "Miss Elizabeth Gordon, a
white woman living in Alexandria," claimed him. He did not find much
fault with her. She permitted him to hire his time, find his own
clothing, etc., by which regulation Joe got along smoothly. Nevertheless
he declared, that he was tired of wearing the yoke, and felt constrained
to throw it off as soon as possible. Miss Gordon was getting old, and
Joe noticed that the young tribe of nephews and nieces was multiplying
in large numbers. This he regarded as a very bad sign; he therefore,
gave the matter of the Underground Rail Road his serious attention, and
it was not long ere he was fully persuaded that it would be wisdom for
him to tarry no longer in the prison-house. Joe had a wife and four
children, which were as heavy weights to hold him in Virginia, but the
spirit of liberty prevailed. Joe, also, left two sisters, one free, the
other a slave. His wife belonged to the widow Irwin. She had assured her
slaves, that she had "provided for them in her will," and that at her
death all would be freed. They were daily living on the faith thus
created, and obviously thought the sooner the Lord relieved the old
mistress of her earthly troubles the better.

Although Joe left his wife and children, he did not forget them, but had
strong faith they would be reunited. After going to Canada, he addressed
several letters to the Secretary of the Committee concerning his family,
and as will be seen by the following, he looked with ardent hopes for
their arrival:


    TORONTO, Nov. 7th, 1857.

    DEAR MR. STILL:--As I must again send you a letter fealing
    myself oblidge to you for all you have done and your kindness.

    I would you to look out for her and get her an ticket and send
    her to me Toronto. Her name are May Ball with five children.
    Please send her as soon as you can.

    Yours very truly,

    JOSEPH BALL.

    Will you please to telegrape to me, No. 31 Dummer st.




Jake, another member of the company of nine, was twenty-two years of
age, of dark hue, round-made, keen eyes, and apparently a man of
superior intelligence. Unfortunately his lot had been of such a nature
that no helping opportunity had been afforded for the cultivation of his
mind.

He condemned in very strong terms a man by the name of Benjamin B.
Chambers, who lived near Elkton, but did not there require the services
of Jake, hiring Jake out just as he would have hired a horse, and
likewise keeping his pay. Jake thought that if justice could have been
awarded him, Chambers would either have had to restore that of which he
had wronged him, or expiate the wrong in prison.

Jake, however, stood more in awe of a young master, who was soon likely
to come into power, than he did of the old master. This son had already
given Jake to understand that once in his hands it "wouldn't be long
before he would have him jingling in his pocket," signifying, that he
would sell him as soon as his father was gone.

The manner of the son stirred Jake's very blood to boiling heat it
seemed. His suffering, and the suffering of his fellow-bondsmen had
never before appeared so hard. The idea that he must work, and be sold
at the pleasure of another, made him decide to "pull up stakes," and
seek refuge elsewhere. Such a spirit as he possessed could not rest in
servitude.



Mary Ann, the wife of Jake, who accompanied him, was a pleasant-looking
bride. She said that she was owned by "Elias Rhoads, a farmer, and a
pretty fair kind of a man." She had been treated very well.



John and Henry Dade, ages twenty and twenty-five years, were from
Washington. They belonged to the class of well-cared for slaves; at
least they said that their mistress had not dealt severely with them,
and they never would have consented to pass through the severe
sufferings encountered on their journey, but for the strong desire they
had to be free. From Canada John wrote back as follows:

ARRIVAL FROM DELAWARE, 1858.


GEORGE LAWS AND COMRADE--TIED AND HOISTED WITH BLOCK AND TACKLE, TO BE
COWHIDED.


George represented the ordinary young slave men of Delaware. He was of
unmixed blood, medium size and of humble appearance. He was destitute of
the knowledge of spelling, to say nothing of reading. Slavery had
stamped him unmistakably for life. To be scantily fed and clothed, and
compelled to work without hire, George did not admire, but had to submit
without murmuring; indeed, he knew that his so-called master, whose name
was Denny, would not be likely to hear complaints from a slave; he
therefore dragged his chain and yielded to his daily task.

One day, while hauling dirt with a fractious horse, the animal
manifested an unwillingness to perform his duty satisfactorily. At this
procedure the master charged George with provoking the beast to do
wickedly, and in a rage he collared George and bade him accompany him
"up stairs" (of the soap house). Not daring to resist, George went along
with him. Ropes being tied around both his wrists, the block and tackle
were fastened thereto, and George soon found himself hoisted on tip-toe
with his feet almost clear of the floor.

[Illustration: ]

The "kind-hearted master" then tore all the poor fellow's old shirt off
his back, and addressed him thus: "You son of a b----h, I will give you
pouting around me; stay there till I go up town for my cowhide."

George begged piteously, but in vain. The fracas caused some excitement,
and it so happened that a show was to be exhibited that day in the town,
which, as is usual in the country, brought a great many people from a
distance; so, to his surprise, when the master returned with his
cowhide, he found that a large number of curiosity-seekers had been
attracted to the soap house to see Mr. Denny perform with his cowhide on
George's back, as he was stretched up by his hands. Many had evidently
made up their minds that it would be more amusing to see the cowhiding
than the circus.

The spectators numbered about three hundred. This was a larger number
than Mr. Denny had been accustomed to perform before, consequently he
was seized with embarrassment; looking confused he left the soap house
and went to his office, to await the dispersion of the crowd.

The throng finally retired, and left George hanging in mortal agony.
Human nature here made a death-struggle; the cords which bound his
wrists were unloosed, and George was then prepared to strike for freedom
at the mouth of the cannon or point of the bayonet. How Denny regarded
the matter when he found that George had not only cheated him out of the
anticipated delight of cowhiding him, but had also cheated him out of
himself is left for the imagination to picture.

George fled from Kent; he was accompanied by a comrade whose name
inadvertently was not recorded; he, however, was described as a dark,
round, and full-faced, stout-built man, with bow legs, and bore the
appearance of having been used hard and kept down, and in ignorance, &c.
Hard usage constrained him to flee from his sore oppression.

ARRIVAL FROM DELAWARE, 1858.


JOHN WEEMS, ALIAS JACK HERRING.


Although Jack was but twenty-three years of age, he had tasted the
bitter cup of Slavery pretty thoroughly under Kendall B. Herring, who
was a member of the Methodist Church, and in Jack's opinion a "mere
pretender, and a man of a very bad disposition." Jack thought that he
had worked full long enough for this Herring for nothing. When a boy
twelve years of age, his mother was sold South; from that day, until the
hour that he fled he had not heard a word from her. In making up his
mind to leave Slavery, the outrage inflicted upon his mother only tended
to increase his resolution.

In speaking of his mistress, he said that "she was a right fine woman."
Notwithstanding all his sufferings in the Kendall family, he seemed
willing to do justice to his master and mistress individually. He left
one sister free and one brother in the hands of Herring. Jack was
described as a man of dark color, stout, and well-made.

ARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, 1858.

RUTH HARPER, GEORGE ROBINSON, PRISCILLA GARDENER, AND JOSHUA JOHN
ANDERSON.




Ruthie's course in seeking her freedom left John McPherson a woman less
to work for him, and to whip, sell, or degrade at his pleasure. It is
due to candor, however, to say that she admitted that she had not been
used very roughly by Mr. McPherson. Ruth was rather a nice-looking young
woman, tall, and polite in her manners. She came from Frederick,
Maryland.



George Robinson stated that he came from a place about one and a half
miles from the Chesapeake Bay, one mile from Old town, and five miles
from Elkton, and was owned by Samuel Smith, a farmer, who was "pretty
cross and an ill man." George's excuse for withdrawing his valuable
services from Mr. Smith at the time that he did, was attributable to the
fact, that he entertained fears that they were about to sell him. Having
cautiousness largely developed he determined to reach Canada and keep
out of danger. George was only twenty-one, passable-looking in
appearance, and of a brown color, and when speaking, stammered
considerably.



Priscilla Gardener fled from the widow Hilliard. Her master departed to
his long home not a great while before she left. Priscilla was a young
woman of about thirty years of age, ordinary size, and of a ginger-bread
color; modest in demeanor. She first commenced her bondage in Richmond,
under the late Benjamin Hilliard, of whom she said that he was "a very
bad man, who could never be pleased by a servant," and was constantly
addicted to fighting not only with others, but also with herself. So
cruelly had Priscilla been treated, that when he died she did not
hesitate to say that she was glad. Soon after this event, sick of
Slavery and unwilling to serve the widow any longer, she determined to
escape, and succeeded.



Joshua John  Anderson fled from a farmer who was said to be a poor man,
by the name of Skelton Price, residing in Baltimore county, near a
little village called Alexandria, on the Harford county turn-pike road.
Price, not able to own a farm and slaves too, rented one, and was trying
to "get up in the world." Price had a wife and family, but in the way of
treatment, Joshua did not say anything very hard against him. As his
excuse for leaving them, he said, coolly, that he had made up his mind
that he could get along better in freedom than he could in Slavery, and
that no man had a right to his labor without paying him for it. He left
his mother and also three brothers and two sisters owned by Price.
Joshua was about twenty-two years of age, of a coarse make, and a dark
hue; he had evidently held but little intercourse with any class, save
such as he found in the corn-field and barn-yard.

ARRIVAL FROM NORTH CAROLINA AND DELAWARE.

"DICK BEESLY",MURRAY YOUNG AND CHARLES ANDREW BOLDEN.




Physically, Dick was hardly up to the ordinary stature of slaves, but
mentally he had the advantage of the masses; he was too sharp to be kept
in Slavery. His hue was perfect, no sign of white about him, if that
were any advantage.

From Dick's story, it appeared that he had seen hard times in North
Carolina, under a man he designated by the name of Richard Smallwood. He
was a farmer, living near Wheldon. One of the faults that he found with
Smallwood was, that he was a "tough, drinking man"--he also charged him
with holding "two hundred and sixty slaves in bonds," the most of whom
he came in possession of through his wife. "She," Dick thought "was
pretty fair." He said that no slave had any reason to look for any other
than hard times under his master, according to what he had seen and
known since he had been in the "institution," and he fancied that his
chances for observation had been equally as good as the great majority
of slaves. Young as he was, Dick had been sold three times already, and
didn't know how much oftener he might have to submit to the same fate if
he remained; so, in order to avoid further trouble, he applied his
entire skill to the grand idea of making his way to Canada.

Manfully did he wrestle with difficulty after difficulty, until he
finally happily triumphed and reached Philadelphia in a good
condition--that is, he was not sick, but he was without
money--home--education or friends, except as he found them among
strangers. He was hopeful, nevertheless.



Murray Young was also of the unmixed-blood class, and only twenty-one
years of age. The spirit of liberty in him was pretty largely developed.
He entertained naught against Dr. Lober, of Newcastle, but rather
against the Doctor's wife. He said that he could get along pretty well
with the Doctor, but, he could not get along with Mrs. Lober. But the
very idea of Slavery was enough for him. He did not mean to work for any
body for nothing.



Andrew Bolden was still younger than Charles Murray, being only eighteen
years of age, but he was very well grown, and on the auction-block he
would, doubtless, have brought a large price. He fled from Newark. His
story contained nothing of marked importance.

    JOS. GRIFFISS,

    St. Leonards, Calvert county, Md.

    Refer to N.E. BERRY, No. 63 Pratt street, Baltimore.


So far as Messrs. Bond, Ireland, and Griffiss may be concerned (if they
are still living), they may not care to have the reward kept in view, or
to hear anything about the "ungrateful" fellows. It may be different,
however, with other parties concerned. This company, some of whom bore
names agreeing with those in the above advertisement, are found
described in the record book as follows:




    Sept. 10th, 1858. John Janney is a fine specimen of the peculiar
    institution; color brown, well-formed, self-possessed and
    intelligent. He says that he fled from master Joseph Griffiss of
    Culbert county, Maryland; that he has been used to "tight work,"
    "allowed no chances," and but "half fed." His reason for leaving
    was partly "hard treatment," and partly because he could "get
    along better in freedom than in slavery." He found fault with
    his master for not permitting him to "learn to read," etc. He
    referred to his master as a man of "fifty years of age, with a
    wife and three children." John said that "she was a large,
    portly woman, with an evil disposition, always wanted to be
    quarreling and fighting, and was stingy." He said, however, that
    his "master's children, Ann Rebecca, Dorcas, and Joe were not
    allowed to meddle with the slaves on the farm." Thirty head of
    slaves belonged on the place.



    Peter Gross says that he too was owned by Joseph Griffiss. Peter
    is, he thinks, thirty-nine years of age,--tall, of a dark
    chestnut color, and in intellect mediocre. He left his wife and
    five children behind. He could not bring them with him,
    therefore he did not tell them that he was about to leave. He
    was much dissatisfied with Slavery and felt that he had been
    badly dealt with, and that he could do better for himself in
    Canada.



    Talbot Johnson, is thirty-five years of age, quite dark, and
    substantially built. He says that he has been treated very
    badly, and that Duke Bond was the name of the "tyrant" who held
    him. He pictured his master as "a lean-faced man--not stout--of
    thirty-eight or thirty-nine years of age, a member of the
    Episcopal Church." "He had a wife and two children; his last
    wife was right pleasant--he was a farmer, and was rich, had sold
    slaves, and was severe when he flogged." Talbot had been
    promised a terrible beating on the return of his master from the
    Springs, whither he had gone to recruit his health, "as he was
    poorly." This was the sole cause of Talbot's flight.



    Sam Gross is about forty, a man of apparent vigor physically,
    and wide awake mentally. He confesses that he fled from George
    Island, near Port Republic, Md. He thought that times with him
    had been bad enough all his life, and he would try to get away
    where he could do better. In referring to his master and
    mistress, he says that "they are both Episcopalians, hard to
    please, and had as bad dispositions as could be,--would try to
    knock the slaves in the head sometimes." This spirit Sam
    condemned in strong terms, and averred that it was on account of
    such treatment that he was moved to seek out the Underground
    Rail Road. Sam left his wife, Mary Ann, and four children, all
    under bonds. His children, he said, were treated horribly. They
    were owned by Joseph Griffiss spoken of above.



    James Henry Jackson is seventeen years of age; he testifies that
    he fled from Frederica, Delaware, where he had been owned by
    Joseph Brown. Jim does not make any serious complaint against
    his master, except that he had him in the market for sale. To
    avert this fate, Jim was moved to flee. His mother, Ann Jackson,
    lived nine miles from Milford, and was owned by Jim Loflin, and
    lived on his place. Of the going of her son she had no
    knowledge.


These narratives have been copied from the book as they were hastily
recorded at the time. During their sojourn at the station, the subjoined
letter came to hand from Thomas Garrett, which may have caused anxiety
and haste:


    WILMINGTON, 9th mo. 6th, 1858.

    ESTEEMED FRIENDS, J.M. McKIM AND WM. STILL:--I have a mixture of
    good and bad news for you. Good in having passed five of God's
    poor safely to Jersey, and Chester county, last week; and this
    day sent on four more, that have caused me much anxiety. They
    were within twenty miles of here on sixth day last, and by
    agreement I had a man out all seventh day night watching for
    them, to pilot them safely, as 1,000 dollars reward was offered
    for four of the five; and I went several miles yesterday in the
    country to try to learn what had become of them, but could not
    hear of them. A man of tried integrity just called to say that
    they arrived at his house last night, about midnight, and I
    employed him to pilot them to a place of safety in Pennsylvania,
    to-night, after which I trust they will be out of reach of their
    pursuers. Now for the bad news. That old scoundrel, who applied
    to me some three weeks since, pretending that he wished me to
    assist him in getting his seven slaves into a free state, to
    avoid the sheriff, and which I agreed to do, if he would bring
    them here; but positively refused to send for them. Ten days
    since I received another letter from him, saying that the
    sheriff had been there, and taken away two of the children,
    which he wished me to raise money to purchase and set free, and
    then closed by saying that his other slaves, a man, his wife,
    and three children had left the same evening and he had no doubt
    I would find them at a colored man's house, he named, here, and
    wished me to ascertain at once and let him know. I at once was
    convinced he wished to know so as to have them arrested and
    taken back. I found the man had arrived; but the woman and
    children had given out, and he left them with a colored family
    in Cecil. I wrote him word the family had not got here, but said
    nothing of the man being here. On seventh day evening I saw a
    colored woman from the neighborhood; she told me that the owner
    and sheriff were out hunting five days for them before they
    found them, and says there is not a greater hypocrite in that
    part of the world. I wrote him a letter yesterday letting him
    know just what I thought of him.

BIRTH-DAY PRESENT FROM THOMAS GARRETT.



    WILMINGTON, 8th mo. 21st, 1858.

    ESTEEMED FRIEND:--WILLIAM STILL:--This is my 69th birth-day, and
    I do not know any better way to celebrate it in a way to accord
    with my feelings, than to send to thee two fugitives, man and
    wife; the man has been here a week waiting for his wife, who is
    expected in time to leave at 9 this evening in the cars for thy
    house with a pilot, who knows where thee lives, but I cannot
    help but feel some anxiety about the woman, as there is great
    commotion just now in the neighborhood where she resides. There
    were 4 slaves betrayed near the Maryland line by a colored man
    named Jesse Perry a few nights since. One of them made a
    confidant of him, and he agreed to pilot them on their way, and
    had several white men secreted to take them as soon as they got
    in his house; he is the scoundrel that was to have charge of the
    7 I wrote you about two weeks since; their master was to take or
    send them there, and he wanted me to send for them. I have since
    been confirmed it was a trap set to catch one of our colored men
    and me likewise, but it was no go. I suspected him from the
    first, but afterwards was fully confirmed in my suspicions. We
    have found the two Rust boys, John and Elsey Bradley, who the
    villain of a Bust took out of jail and sold to a trader of the
    name of Morris, who sold them to a trader who took them to
    Richmond, Virginia, where they were sold at public sale two days
    before we found them, for $2600, but fortunately the man had not
    paid for them; our Attorney had them by habeas corpus before a
    Judge, who detained them till we can prove their identity and
    freedom; they are to have a hearing on 2d day next, when we hope
    to have a person on there to prove them. In haste, thine,

    THOS. GARRETT.


Unfortunately all the notice that the record contains of the two
passengers referred to, is in the following words: "Two cases not
written out for want of time."

The "boys" alluded to as having been "found" &c., were free-born, but
had been kidnapped and carried south and sold.

Three days after the above letter, the watchful Garrett furnished
further light touching the hair-breadth escape of the two that he had
written about, and at the same time gave an interesting account of the
efforts which were made to save the poor kidnapped boys, &c.



SECOND LETTER FROM THOMAS GARRETT.



    WILMINGTON, 8th mo. 25th, 1858.

    ESTEEMED FRIEND:--WILLIAM STILL:--Thine was received yesterday.
    Those two I wrote about to be with thee last 7th day evening, I
    presume thee has seen before this. A. Allen had charge of them;
    he had them kept out of sight at the depot here till the cars
    should be ready to start, in charge of a friend, while he kept a
    lookout and got a ticket. When the Delaware cars arrived, who
    should step out but the master of both man and woman, (as they
    had belonged to different persons); they knew him, and he knew
    them. He left in a different direction from where they were
    secreted, and got round to them and hurried them off to a place
    of safety, as he was afraid to take them home for fear they
    would search the house. On 1st day morning the boat ran to
    Chester to take our colored people to the camp at Media; he had
    them disguised, and got them in the crowd and went with them;
    when he got to Media, he placed them in care of a colored man,
    who promised to hand them over to thee on 2d day last; we expect
    3 more next 7th day night, but how we shall dispose of them we
    have not yet determined; it will depend on circumstances. Judge
    Layton has been on with a friend to Richmond, Virginia, and
    fully identified the two Bradley boys that were kidnapped by
    Clem Rust. He has the assurance of the Judge there that they
    will be tried and their case decided by Delaware Laws, by which
    they must be declared free and returned here. We hope to be able
    to bring such proof against both Rust and the man he sold them
    to, who took them out of the State, to teach them a lesson they
    will remember.

ARRIVAL FROM THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA, 1858.

REBECCA JACKSON AND DAUGHTER, AND ROBERT SHORTER.


The road to Washington was doing about this time a marvellously large
business. "William Penn" and other friends in Washington were most
vigilant, and knew where to find passengers who were daily thirsting for
deliverance.



Rebecca Jackson was a woman of about thirty-seven years of age, of a
yellow color, and of bright intellect, prepossessing in her manners. She
had pined in bondage in Georgetown under Mrs. Margaret Dick, a lady of
wealth and far advanced in life, a firm believer in slavery and the
Presbyterian Church, of which she was a member.

Rebecca had been her chief attendant, knew all her whims and ways to
perfection. According to Rebecca's idea, "she was a peevish, fretful,
ill-natured, but kind-hearted creature." Being very tired of her old
mistress and heartily sick of bondage, and withal desiring to save her
daughter, she ascertained the doings of the Underground Rail Road,--was
told about Canada, &c. She therefore resolved to make a bold adventure.
Mrs. Dick had resided a long time in Georgetown, but owned three large
plantations in the country, over which she kept three overseers to look
after the slaves. Rebecca had a free husband, but she was not free to
serve him, as she had to be digging day and night for the "white
people." Robert, a son of the mistress lived with his mother. While
Rebecca regarded him as "a man with a very evil disposition," she
nevertheless believed that he had "sense enough to see that the present
generation of slaves would not bear so much as slaves had been made to
bear the generation past."

ARRIVAL FROM HONEY BROOK TOWNSHIP, 1858.


FRANK CAMPBELL.


Frank was a man of blunt features, rather stout, almost jet black, and
about medium height and weight. He was not certain about his age, rather
thought that he was between thirty and forty years. He had been deprived
of learning to read or write, but with hard treatment he had been made
fully acquainted under a man named Henry Campbell, who called himself
Frank's master, and without his consent managed to profit by his daily
sweat and toil. This Campbell was a farmer, and was said to be the owner
of about one hundred head of slaves, besides having large investments in
other directions. He did not hesitate to sell slaves if he could get his
price. Every now and then one and another would find it his turn to be
sold. Frank resolved to try and get out of danger before times were
worse. So he struck out resolutely for freedom and succeeded.

ARRIVAL FROM ALEXANDRIA, VA., 1858.

RICHARD BAYNE, CARTER DOWLING AND BENJAMIN TAYLOR.




Richard stated that a man named "Rudolph Massey, a merchant tailor, hard
rum-drinker, card player, etc." claimed to own him, and had held him, up
to the time of his escape, as with bands of brass.

Richard said, "I was hired out for ten dollars a month, but I never
suffered like many--didn't leave because I have been abused, but simply
to keep from falling into the hands of some heirs that I had been willed
to." In case of a division, Richard did not see how he could be divided
without being converted into money. Now, as he could have no
fore-knowledge as to the place or person into whose hands he might be
consigned by the auctioneer, he concluded that he could not venture to
risk himself in the hands of the young heirs. Richard began to consider
what Slavery was, and his eyes beheld chains, whips, hand-cuffs,
auction-blocks, separations and countless sufferings that had partially
been overlooked before; he felt the injustice of having to toil hard to
support a drunkard and gambler. At the age of twenty-three Richard
concluded to "lay down the shovel and the hoe," and look out for
himself. His mother was owned by Massey, but his father belonged to the
"superior race" or claimed so to do, and if anything could be proved by
appearances it was evident that he was the son of a white man. Richard
was endowed with a good share of intelligence. He not only left his
mother but also one sister to clank their chains together.



Carter, who accompanied Richard, had just reached his majority. He
stated that he escaped from a "maiden lady" living in Alexandria, known
by the name of Miss Maria Fitchhugh, the owner of twenty-five slaves.
Opposed to Slavery as he was, he nevertheless found no fault with his
mistress, but on the contrary, said that she was a very respectable
lady, and a member of the Episcopal Church. She often spoke of freeing
her servants when she died; such talk was too uncertain for Carter, to
pin his faith to, and he resolved not to wait. Such slave-holders
generally lived a great while, and when they did die, they many times
failed to keep their promises. He concluded to heed the voice of reason,
and at once leave the house of bondage. His mother, father, five
brothers and six sisters all owned by Miss Fitchhugh, formed a strong
tie to keep him from going; he "conferred not with flesh and blood," but
made a determined stroke for freedom.



Benjamin, the third in this company, was only twenty years of age, but a
better-looking specimen for the auction-block could hardly be found. He
fled from the Meed estate; his mistress had recently died leaving her
affairs, including the disposal of the slaves, to be settled at an early
date. He spoke of his mistress as "a very clever lady to her servants,"
but since her death he had realized the danger that he was in of being
run off south with a coffle gang. He explained the course frequently
resorted to by slave-holders under similar circumstances thus:
"frequently slaves would be snatched up, hand cuffed and hurried off
south on the night train without an hour's notice." Fearing that this
might be his fate, he deemed it prudent to take a northern train via the
Underground Rail Road without giving any notice.

He left no parents living, but six brothers and four sisters, all slaves
with the exception of one brother who had bought himself. In order to
defend themselves if molested on the road, the boys had provided
themselves with pistols and dirks, and declared that they were fully
bent on using them rather than be carried back to slavery.

ARRIVAL FROM THE SEAT OF GOVERNMENT.

HANSON WILLIAMS, NACE SHAW, GUSTA YOUNG, AND DANIEL M'NORTON SMITH.



    $200 REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber, (Levi Pumphrey,) two
    NEGRO MEN--one, named "Hanson," about forty years old, with one
    eye out, about 5 feet 4 inches in height, full, bushy hair and
    whiskers and copper color. "Gusta" is about 21 years or 22 years
    of age, smooth face and thick lips, and stoops in his walk;
    black color, about 5 feet 5 or 6 inches in height; took away
    sundry articles of clothing.

    I will give one hundred dollars for each of them, if secured in
    jail so that I can get them.

    LEVI PUMPHREY,

    Washington City, D.C.

    s14-6t.


These four fugitives were full of enthusiasm for Canada, although by no
means among the worst abused of their class.



Hanson was about forty years of age, with apparently a good degree of
intellect, and of staid principles.

In the above advertisement clipped from the Baltimore Sun, he is more
fully described by Mr. Levi Pumphrey; it can now be taken for what it is
worth. But, as Hanson left home suddenly without apprising his owner, or
any of his owner's intimate white friends, of the circumstances which
led him to thus leave, his testimony and explanation, although late, may
not be wholly uninteresting to Mr. Levi Pumphrey and others who took an
interest in the missing "Hanson." "How have you had it in slavery?" he
was asked. "I have had it pretty rough," answered Hanson. "Who held you
in bondage, and how have you been treated?" "I was owned by Levi
Pumphrey, an old man with one eye, a perfect savage; he allowed no
privileges of any kind, Sunday or Monday."



Gusta, who was also described in Pumphrey's advertisement, was a
rugged-looking specimen, and his statement tended to strengthen Hanson's
in every particular. It was owing to the bad treatment of Pumphrey, that
Gusta left in the manner that he did.

After deciding to take his departure for Canada, he provided himself
with a Colt's revolver, and resolved that if any man should attempt to
put his hand on him while he was on the "King's highway," he would shoot
him down, not excepting his old master.


    $150 REWARD.--Ran away from the subscriber, living near Upper
    Marlboro', Prince George's county, Md., on the 11th day of
    September, 1858, a negro man, "Nace," who calls himself "Nace
    Shaw;" is forty-five years of age, about five feet 8 or 9 inches
    high, of a copper color, full suit of hair, except a bald place
    upon the top of his head. He has a mother living in Washington
    city, on South B street, No. 212 Island.

    I will pay the above reward no matter where taken, if secured in
    jail so that I get him again.

    SARAH ANN TALBURTT.

    sl5-eotf.


Nace, advertised by Miss Sarah Ann Talburtt, was a remarkably
good-natured looking piece of merchandise. He gave a very interesting
account of his so called mistress, how he came to leave her, etc. Said
Nace: "My mistress was an old maid, and lived on a farm. I was her
foreman on the farm. She lived near Marlborough Forest, in Prince
George's county, Md., about twelve miles from Washington; she was a
member of the Episcopal Church. She fed well, and quarrelled a caution,
from Monday morning till Saturday night, not only with the slaves, but
among the inmates of the big house. My mistress had three sisters, all
old maids living with her, and a niece besides; their names were
Rebecca, Rachel, Caroline, and Sarah Ann, and a more disagreeable family
of old maids could not be found in a year's time. To arise in the
morning before my mistress, Sarah Ann, was impossible." Then, without
making it appear that he or other of the slaves had been badly treated
under Miss Talburtt, he entered upon the cause of escape, and said; "I
left simply because I wanted a chance for my life; I wanted to die a
free man if it pleased God to have it so." His wife and a grown-up son
he was obliged to leave, as no opportunity offered to bring them away
with him.



Dan was also of this party. He was well tinctured with Anglo-Saxon
blood. His bondage had been in Alexandria, with a mill-wright, known by
the name of James Garnett. Dan had not been in Garnett's hands a great
while. Mr. Garnett's ways and manners were not altogether pleasing to
him; besides, Dan stated that he was trying to sell him, and he made up
his mind that at an early opportunity, he would avail himself of a
ticket for Canada, via the Underground Rail Road. He left his mother and
brothers all scattered.

CROSSING THE BAY IN A SKIFF.

WILLIAM THOMAS COPE, JOHN BOICE GREY, HENRY BOICE AND ISAAC WHITE.


These young bondmen, whilst writhing under the tortures heaped upon
them, resolved, at the cost of life, to make a desperate trial for free
land; to rid themselves of their fetters, at whatever peril they might
have to encounter. The land route presented less encouragement than by
water; they knew but little, however, concerning either way. After much
anxious reflection, they finally decided to make their Underground Rail
Road exit by water. Having lived all their lives not far from the bay,
they had some knowledge of small boats, skiffs in particular, but of
course they were not the possessors of one. Feeling that there was no
time to lose, they concluded to borrow a skiff, though they should never
return it. So one Saturday evening, toward the latter part of January,
the four young slaves stood on the beach near Lewes, Delaware, and cast
their longing eyes in the direction of the Jersey shore. A fierce gale
was blowing, and the waves were running fearfully high; not daunted,
however, but as one man they resolved to take their lives in their hands
and make the bold adventure.

With simple faith they entered the skiff; two of them took the oars,
manfully to face uncertain dangers from the waves. But they remained
steadfast, oft as they felt that they were making the last stroke with
their oars, on the verge of being overwhelmed with the waves. At every
new stage of danger they summoned courage by remembering that they were
escaping for their lives.

[Illustration: ]

Late on Sunday afternoon, the following day, they reached their much
desired haven, the Jersey shore. The relief and joy were unspeakably
great, yet they were strangers in a strange land. They knew not which
way to steer. True, they knew that New Jersey bore the name of being a
Free State; but they had reason to fear that they were in danger. In
this dilemma they were discovered by the captain of an oyster boat whose
sense of humanity was so strongly appealed to by their appearance that
he engaged to pilot them to Philadelphia. The following account of them
was recorded:



William Thomas was a yellow man, twenty-four years of age, and
possessing a vigorous constitution. He accused Shepherd P. Houston of
having restrained him of his liberty, and testified that said Houston
was a very bad man. His vocation was that of a farmer, on a small scale;
as a slave-holder he was numbered with the "small fry." Both master and
mistress were members of the Methodist Church. According to William
Thomas' testimony his mistress as well as his master was very hard on
the slaves in various ways, especially in the matter of food and
clothing. It would require a great deal of hard preaching to convince
him that such Christianity was other than spurious.



John stated that David Henry Houston, a farmer, took it upon himself to
exercise authority over him. Said John, "If you didn't do the work
right, he got contrary, and wouldn't give you anything to eat for a
whole day at a time; he said a 'nigger and a mule hadn't any feeling.'"
He described his stature and circumstances somewhat thus: "Houston is a
very small man; for some time his affairs had been in a bad way; he had
been broke, some say he had bad luck for killing my brother. My brother
was sick, but master said he wasn't sick, and he took a chunk, and beat
on him, and he died a few days after." John firmly believed that his
brother had been the victim of a monstrous outrage, and that he too was
liable to the same treatment.

John was only nineteen years of age, spare built, chestnut color, and
represented the rising mind of the slaves of the South.



Henry was what might be termed a very smart young man, considering that
he had been deprived of a knowledge of reading. He was a brother of
John, and said that he also had been wrongfully enslaved by David
Houston, alluded to above. He fully corroborated the statement of his
brother, and declared, moreover, that his sister had not long since been
sold South, and that he had heard enough to fully convince him that he
and his brother were to be put up for sale soon.

Of their mistress John said that she was a "pretty easy kind of a woman,
only she didn't want to allow enough to eat, and wouldn't mend any
clothes for us."



Isaac was twenty-two, quite black, and belonged to the "rising" young
slaves of Delaware. He stated that he had been owned by a "blacksmith, a
very hard man, by the name of Thomas Carper." Isaac was disgusted with
his master's ignorance, and criticised him, in his crude way, to a
considerable extent. Isaac had learned blacksmithing under Carper. Both
master and mistress were Methodists. Isaac said that he "could not
recommend his mistress, as she was given to bad practices," so much so
that he could hardly endure her. He also charged the blacksmith with
being addicted to bad habits. Sometimes Isaac would be called upon to
receive correction from his master, which would generally be dealt out
with a "chunk of wood" over his "no feeling" head. On a late occasion,
when Isaac was being _chunked_ beyond measure, he resisted, but the
persistent blacksmith did not yield until he had so far disabled Isaac
that he was rendered helpless for the next two weeks. While in this
state he pledged himself to freedom and Canada, and resolved to win the
prize by crossing the Bay.

While these young passengers possessed brains and bravery of a rare
order, at the same time they brought with them an unusual amount of the
soil of Delaware; their persons and old worn-out clothing being full of
it. Their appearance called loudly for immediate cleansing. A room--free
water--free soap, and such other assistance as was necessary was
tendered them in order to render the work as thorough as possible. This
healthy process over, clean and comfortable clothing were furnished, and
the change in their appearance was so marked, that they might have
passed as strangers, if not in the immediate corn-fields of their
masters, certainly among many of their old acquaintances, unless
subjected to the most careful inspection. Raised in the country and on
farms, their masters and mistresses had never dreamed of encouraging
them to conform to habits of cleanliness; washing their persons and
changing their garments were not common occurrences. The coarse garment
once on would be clung to without change as long as it would hold
together. The filthy cabins allotted for their habitations were in
themselves incentives to personal uncleanliness. In some districts this
was more apparent than in others. From some portions of Maryland and
Delaware, in particular, passengers brought lamentable evidence of a
want of knowledge and improvement in this direction. But the master, not
the slave, was blameworthy. The master, as has been intimated, found but
one suit for working (and sometimes none for Sunday), consequently if
Tom was set to ditching one day and became muddy and dirty, and the next
day he was required to haul manure, his ditching suit had to be used,
and if the next day he was called into the harvest-field, he was still
obliged to wear his barn-yard suit, and so on to the end. Frequently
have such passengers been thoroughly cleansed for the first time in
their lives at the Philadelphia station. Some needed practical lessons
before they understood the thoroughness necessary to cleansing. Before
undertaking the operation, therefore, in order that they might be made
to feel the benefit to be derived therefrom, they would need to have the
matter brought home to them in a very gentle way, lest they might feign
to fear taking cold, not having been used to it, etc.

It was customary to say to them: "We want to give you some clean
clothing, but you need washing before putting them on. It will make you
feel like a new man to have the dirt of slavery all washed off. Nothing
that could be done for you would make you feel better after the fatigue
of travel than a thorough bath. Probably you have not been allowed the
opportunity of taking a good bath, and so have not enjoyed one since
your mother bathed you. Don't be afraid of the water or soap--the harder
you rub yourself the better you will feel. Shall we not wash your back
and neck for you? We want you to look well while traveling on the
Underground Rail Road, and not forget from this time forth to try to
take care of yourself," &c., &c. By this course the reluctance where it
existed would be overcome and the proposition would be readily acceded
to, if the water was not too cool; on the other hand, if cool, a slight
shudder might be visible, sufficient to raise a hearty laugh. Yet, when
through, the candidate always expressed a hearty sense of satisfaction,
and was truly thankful for this attention.

ARRIVAL FROM KENT COUNTY, MD., 1858.

ASBURY IRWIN, EPHRAIM ENNIS, AND LYDIA ANN JOHNS.


The party whose narratives are here given brought grave charges against
a backsliding member of the Society of Friends--a renegade Quaker.

Doubtless rare instances may be found where men of the Quaker
persuasion, emigrating from free and settling in slave States and among
slaveholders, have deserted their freedom-loving principle and led
captive by the force of bad examples, have linked hands with the
oppressor against the oppressed. It is probable, however, that this is
the only case that may turn up in these records to the disgrace of this
body of Christians in whom dwelt in such a signal degree large sympathy
for the slave and the fleeing bondman. Many fugitives were indebted to
Friends who aided them in a quiet way, not allowing their left hand to
know what their right hand did, and the result was that Underground Rail
Road operations were always pretty safe and prosperous where the line of
travel led through "Quaker settlements." We can speak with great
confidence on this point especially with regard to Pennsylvania, where a
goodly number might be named, if necessary, whose hearts, houses,
horses, and money were always found ready and willing to assist the
fugitive from the prison-house. It is with no little regret that we feel
that truth requires us to connect the so-called owner of Asbury,
Ephraim, and Lydia with the Quakers.



Asbury was first examined, and his story ran substantially thus: "I run
away because I was used bad; three years ago I was knocked dead with an
axe by my master; the blood run out of my head as if it had been poured
out of a tumbler; you can see the mark plain enough--look here," (with
his finger on the spot). "I left Millington, at the head of Chester in
Kent County, Maryland, where I had been held by a farmer who called
himself Michael Newbold. He was originally from Mount Holly, New Jersey,
but had been living in Maryland over twenty years. He was called a
Hickory Quaker, and he had a real Quaker for a wife. Before he was in
Maryland five years he bought slaves, became a regular slave-holder, got
to drinking and racing horses, and was very bad--treated all hands bad,
his wife too, so that she had to leave him and go to Philadelphia to her
kinsfolks. It was because he was so bad we all had to leave," &c.

While Asbury's story appeared truthful and simple, a portion of it was
too shocking to morality and damaging to humanity to be inserted in
these pages.

Asbury was about forty years of age, a man of dark hue, size and height
about mediocrity, and mental ability quite above the average.



Ephraim was a fellow-servant and companion of Asbury. He was a man of
superior physical strength, and from all outward appearance, he
possessed qualities susceptible of ready improvement. He not only spoke
of Newbold in terms of strong condemnation but of slave-holders and
slavery everywhere. The lessons he had learned gave him ample
opportunity to speak from experience and from what he had observed in
the daily practices of slave-holders; consequently, with his ordinary
gifts, it was impossible for him to utter his earnest feelings without
making a deep impression.



Lydia also fled from Michael Newbold. She was a young married woman,
only twenty-two years of age, of a chestnut color and a pleasant
countenance. Her flight for liberty cost her her husband, as she was
obliged to leave him behind. What understanding was entered into between
them prior to her departure we failed to note at the time. It was very
clear that she had decided never to wear the yoke again.

ARRIVAL FROM WASHINGTON, 1858.


JOSEPHINE ROBINSON.


Many reasons were given by Josephine for leaving the sunny South. She
had a mistress, but was not satisfied with her--hadn't a particle of
love for her; "she was all the time fussing and scolding, and never
could be satisfied." She was very well off, and owned thirteen or
fourteen head of slaves. She was a member of the Methodist Church, was
stingy and very mean towards her slaves. Josephine having lived with her
all her life, professed to have a thorough knowledge of her ways and
manners, and seemed disposed to speak truthfully of her. The name of her
mistress was Eliza Hambleton, and she lived in Washington. Josephine had
fully thought over the matter of her rights, so much so, that she was
prompted to escape. So hard did she feel her lot to be, that she was
compelled to resign her children, uncle and aunt to the cruel mercy of
slavery. What became of the little ones, David, Ogden and Isaiah, is a
mystery.



ARRIVAL FROM CECIL COUNTY, 1858.


ROBERT JOHNS AND HIS WIFE "SUE ANN."


Fortunately, in this instance, man and wife succeeded in making their
way out of Slavery together. Robert was a man of small stature, and the
farthest shade from white. In appearance and intellect he represented
the ordinary Maryland slave, raised on a farm, surrounded with no
refining influences or sympathy. He stated that a man by the name of
William Cassey had claimed the right to his labor, and that he had been
kept in bondage on his farm.

For a year or more before setting out for freedom, Robert had watched
his master pretty closely, and came to the conclusion, that he was "a
monstrous blustery kind of a man; one of the old time fellows, very hard
and rash--not fit to own a dog." He owned twelve slaves; Robert resolved
that he would make one less in a short while. He laid the matter before
his wife, "Sue," who was said to be the property of Susan Flinthrew,
wife of John Flinthrew, of Cecil county, Maryland. "Sue" having suffered
severely, first from one and then another, sometimes from floggings, and
at other times from hunger, and again from not being half clothed in
cold weather, was prepared to consider any scheme that looked in the
direction of speedy deliverance. The way that they were to travel, and
the various points of danger to be passed on the road were fully
considered; but Robert and Sue were united and agreed that they could
not fare much worse than they had fared, should they be captured and
carried back. In this state of mind, as in the case of thousands of
others, they set out for a free State, and in due time reached
Pennsylvania and the Vigilance Committee, to whom they made known the
facts here recorded, and received aid and comfort in return.

Sue was a young woman of twenty-three, of a brown color, and somewhat
under medium size.



ARRIVAL FROM GEORGETOWN, D.C., 1858.

PERRY CLEXTON, JIM BANKS AND CHARLES NOLE.


This party found no very serious obstacles in their travels, as their
plans were well arranged, and as they had at least natural ability
sufficient for ordinary emergencies.



Perry reported that he left "a man by the name of John M. Williams, of
Georgetown, D.C., who was in the wood business, and kept a wharf." As to
treatment, he said that he had not been used very hard, but had been
worked hard and allowed but few privileges. The paltry sum of
twenty-five cents a week, was all that was allowed him out of his hire.
With a wife and one child this might seem a small sum, but in reality it
was a liberal outlay compared with what many slaves were allowed. Perry
being a ready-witted article, thought that it was hardly fair that Mr.
Williams should live by the sweat of his brow instead of his own; he was
a large, portly man, and able to work for himself in Perry's opinion.
For a length of time, the notion of leaving and going to Canada was
uppermost in his heart; probably he would have acted with more
promptness but for the fact that his wife and child rested with great
weight on his mind. Finally the pressure became so great that he felt
that he must leave at all hazards, forsaking wife and child, master and
chains. He was a young man, of about twenty-five years of age, of a dark
shade, ordinary build, and full of grit. His wife was named Amelia;
whether she ever afterwards heard from her husband is a question.



Jim, who accompanied Perry, brought the shoe-making art with him. He had
been held a slave under John J. Richards, although he was quite as much
a white man as he was black. He was a mulatto, twenty-nine years of age,
well-made, and bore a grum countenance, but a brave and manly will to
keep up his courage on the way. He said that he had been used very well,
had no fault to find with John J. Richards, who was possibly a near
relative of his. He forsook his mother, four brothers and three sisters
with no hope of ever seeing them again.



Charles bore strong testimony in favor of his master, Blooker W.
Hansborough, a farmer, a first-rate man to his servants, said Charles.
"I was used very well, can't complain." "Why did you not remain then?"
asked a member of the Committee. "I left," answered C., "because I was
not allowed to live with my wife. She with our six children, lived a
long distance from my master's place, and he would not hire me out where
I could live near my wife, so I made up my mind that I would try and do
better. I could see no enjoyment that way." As the secret of his
master's treatment is here brought to light, it is very evident that
Charles, in speaking so highly in his favor, failed to take a just view
of him, as no man could really be first-rate to his servants, who would
not allow a man to live with his wife and children, and who would
persist in taking from another what he had no right to take.
Nevertheless, as Charles thought his master "first-rate," he shall have
the benefit of the opinion, but it was suspected that Charles was not
disposed to find fault with his kin, as it was very likely that the old
master claimed some of the white blood in his veins.



ARRIVAL FROM SUSSEX COUNTY, 1858.

JACOB BLOCKSON, GEORGE ALLIGOOD, JIM ALLIGOOD, AND GEORGE LEWIS.


The coming of Jacob and his companions was welcomed in the usual way.
The marks of Slavery upon them were evident; however they were subjected
to the usual critical examination, which they bore with composure, and
without the least damage. The following notes in the main were recorded
from their statements:



Jacob was a stout and healthy-looking man, about twenty-seven years of
age, with a countenance indicative of having no sympathy with Slavery.
Being invited to tell his own story, describe his master, etc., he
unhesitatingly relieved himself somewhat after this manner; "I escaped
from a man by the name of Jesse W. Paten; he was a man of no business,
except drinking whiskey, and farming. He was a light complected man,
tall large, and full-faced, with a large nose. He was a widower. He
belonged to no society of any kind. He lived near Seaford, in Sussex
county, Delaware."

"I left because I didn't want to stay with him any longer. My master was
about to be sold out this Fall, and I made up my mind that I did not
want to be sold like a horse, the way they generally sold darkies then;
so when I started I resolved to die sooner than I would be taken back;
this was my intention all the while.

"I left my wife, and one child; the wife's name was Lear, and the child
was called Alexander. I want to get them on soon too. I made some
arrangements for their coming if I got off safe to Canada."



George was next called upon to give his statement concerning where he
was from, etc. I "scaped" from Sussex too, from a man by the name of
George M. Davis, a large man, dark-complected, and about fifty years of
age; he belonged to the old side Methodist Church, was a man with a
family, and followed farming, or had farming done by me and others.
Besides he was a justice of the peace. I always believed that the Master
above had no wish for me to be held in bondage all my days; but I
thought if I made up my mind to stay in Slavery, and not to make a
desperate trial for my freedom, I would never have any better times. I
had heard that my old mistress had willed me to her children, and
children's children. I thought at this rate there was no use of holding
on any longer for the good time to come, so here I said, I am going, if
I die a trying. I got me a dagger, and made up my mind if they attempted
to take me on the road, I would have one man. As for my part, I have not
had it so slavish as many, but I have never had any privileges to learn
to read, or to go about anywhere. Now and then they let me go to church.
My master belonged to church, and so did I.

For a young man, being only twenty-two years of age, who had been kept
from the light of freedom, as much as he had, his story was thought to
be exceedingly well told throughout.



James, a brother of George, said: "I came from Horse's Cross-Roads, not
far from where my brother George came from. William Gray, rail road
ticket agent at Bridgewater, professed to own me. He was a tolerable
sized man, with very large whiskers, and dark hair; he was rather a
steady kind of a man, he had a wife, but no child. The reason I left, I
thought I had served Slavery long enough, as I had been treated none the
best. I did not believe in working my life out just to support some body
else. My master had as many hands and feet as I have, and is as able to
work for his bread as I am; and I made up my mind that I wouldn't stay
to be a slave under him any longer, but that I would go to Canada, and
be my own master."

James left his poor wife, and three children, slaves perhaps for life.
The wife's name was Esther Ann, the children were called Mary, Henry,
and Harriet. All belonged to Jesse Laten.



George Lewis had more years than any of his companions, being about
forty years of age. He had been kept in as low a state of ignorance as
the ingenuity of a slave-holder of Delaware could keep one possessed of
as much mother-wit as he was, for he was not quite so ignorant as the
interests of the system required. His physical make and mental capacity
were good. He was decidedly averse to the peculiar institution in every
particular. He stated, that a man named Samuel Laws had held him in
bondage--that this "Laws was a man of no business--just sat about the
house and went about from store to store and sat; that he was an old
man, pretty grey, very long hair. He was a member of a church in the
neighborhood, which was called Radical." Of this church and its members
he could give but little account, either of their peculiarities or
creed; he said, however, that they worshipped a good deal like the
Methodists, and allowed their members to swear heartily for slavery.

"Something told" George that he had worked long enough as a slave, and
that he should be man enough to take the Underground Rail Road and go
off to a free country. Accordingly George set out. When he arrived at
the station he was so highly delighted with his success and the prospect
before him, that he felt very sorry that he hadn't started ten years
sooner. He said that he would have done so, but he was afraid, as
slave-holders were always making the slaves believe that if they should
ever escape they would catch them and bring them back and sell them down
South, certain; that they always did catch every one who ran off, but
never brought them home, but sold them right off where they could never
run away any more, or get to see their relatives again. This threat,
George said, was continually rung in the ears of the slaves, and with
the more timid it was very effective.

Jacob Blockson, after reaching Canada, true to the pledge that he made
to his bosom companion, wrote back as follows:


    SAINT CATHARINES. Cannda West, Dec. 26th, 1858.

    DEAR WIFE:--I now infom you I am in Canada and am well and hope
    you are the same, and would wish you to be here next august, you

    JACOB BLOCKSON.

    MR. STILL: SIR:--you will please Envelope this and send it to
    John Sheppard Bridgeville P office in Sussex county Delaware,
    seal it in black and oblige me, write to her to come to you.




SUNDRY ARRIVALS IN 1859.

SARAH ANN MILLS, Boonsborough; CAROLINE GASSWAY, Mt. Airy; LEVIN HOLDEN,
Laurel; WILLIAM JAMES CONNER, with his wife, child, and four brothers;
JAMES LAZARUS, Delaware; RICHARD WILLIAMS, Richmond, Virginia; SYDNEY
HOPKINS and HENRY WHEELER, Havre de Grace.




Sarah Mills set out for freedom long before she reached womanhood; being
about sixteen years of age. She stated that she had been very cruelly
treated, that she was owned by a man named Joseph O'Neil, "a tax
collector and a very bad man."  Under said O'Neil she had been required
to chop wood, curry horses, work in the field like a man, and all one
winter she had been compelled to go barefooted. Three weeks before Sarah
fled, her mistress was called away by death; nevertheless Sarah could
not forget how badly she had been treated by her while living. According
to Sarah's testimony the mistress was no better than her husband. Sarah
came from Boonsborough, near Hagerstown, Md., leaving her mother and
other relatives in that neighborhood.

It was gratifying to know that such bond-women so early got beyond the
control of slave-holders; yet girls of her age from having had no pains
taken for their improvement, appealed loudly for more than common
sympathy and humanity, but rarely ever found it; on the contrary, their
paths were beset with great danger.



Caroline Gassway, after being held to service by Summersett Walters,
until she had reached her twenty-seventh year, was forced, by hard
treatment and the love of freedom, to make an effort for deliverance.
Her appearance at once indicated, although she was just out of the
prison-house, that she possessed more than an ordinary share of courage,
and that she had had a keen insight into the system under which she had
been oppressed. She was of a dark chestnut color, well-formed, with a
large and high forehead, indicative of intellect. She had much to say of
the ways and practices of slave-holders; of the wrongs of the system.
She dwelt especially upon her own situation as a slave, and the
character of her master; she told not only of his ill treatment of her,
but described his physical appearance as well. "He was a spare-made man,
with a red head and quick temper: he would go off in a flurry like a
flash of powder, and would behave shamefully towards the slaves when in
these fits of passion." His wife, however, Caroline confessed was of a
different temper, and was a pretty good kind of a woman. If he had been
anything like his wife in disposition, most likely Caroline would have
remained in bondage. Fortunately, Caroline was a single woman. She left
her mother.



Levin Holden, having been sold only a few weeks prior to his escape, was
so affected by the change which awaited him, that he was irresistibly
led to seek the Underground Rail Road. Previous to being sold he was
under a master by the name of Jonathan Bailey, who followed farming in
the neighborhood of Laurel, Delaware, and, as a master, was considered a
moderate man--was also well to do in the world; but the new master he
could not endure, as he had already let the secret out that Levin was to
be sent South. Levin had a perfect horror of a more Southern latitude;
he made up his mind that he would try his luck for Canada. Levin was a
man of twenty-seven years of age, smart, dark color, and of a good size
for all sorts of work.



William James Conner, his wife, child, and four brothers came next. The
brothers were hale-looking fellows, and would have commanded high prices
in any market South of Mason and Dixon's Line. It was said, that they
were the property of Kendall Major Lewis, who lived near Laurel,
Delaware. It was known, however, that he never had any deed from the
Almighty, but oppressed them without any just right so to do; they were
perfectly justifiable in leaving Kendall Major Lewis, and all his
sympathizers, to take care of themselves as best they could.

No very serious charges were made against Lewis, but on the contrary
they said, that he had been looked upon as a "moderate slave-holder;"
they also said, that "he had been a member of the Methodist Episcopal
Church for fifty years, and stood high in that body." Furthermore they
stated, that he sold slaves occasionally. Eight had been sold by him
some time before this party escaped (two of them to Georgia); besides
William James had been sold and barely found opportunity to escape. Wm.
James, Major Lewis, Dennis Betts, Peter, and Lazarus, with the wife and
child of the former, not only found themselves stripped from day to day
of their hard earnings, but fearful forebodings of the auction-block
were ever uppermost in their minds. While they spoke of Lewis as
"moderate," etc., they all said that he allowed no privileges to his
slaves.



Richard Williams gave a full account of himself, but only a meagre
report was recorded. He said that he came from Richmond, and left
because he was on the point of being sold by John A. Smith, who owned
him. He gave Smith credit for being a tolerable fair kind of a
slave-holder, but added, that "his wife was a notoriously hard woman;"
she had made a very deep impression on Richard's mind by her treatment
of him. In finding himself on free ground, however, with cheering
prospects ahead, he did not stop to brood over the ills that he had
suffered, but rejoiced heartily. He left his wife, Julia, who was free.



Sydney Hopkins and Henry Wheeler. These young men made their way out of
Slavery together. While Sydney lives he will forever regard Jacob Hoag,
of Havre-de-Grace, as the person who cheated him out of himself, and
prevented him from becoming enlightened and educated.

Henry, his companion, was also from Havre De Grace. He had had trouble
with a man by the name of Amos Barnes, or in other words Barnes claimed
to own him, just as he owned a horse or a mule, and daily controlled him
in about the same manner that he would manage the animals above alluded
to. Henry could find no justification for such treatment. He suffered
greatly under the said Barnes, and finally his eyes were open to see
that there was an Underground Rail Road for the benefit of all such
slavery-sick souls as himself. So he got a ticket as soon as possible,
and came through without accident, leaving Amos Barnes to do the best he
could for a living. This candidate for Canada was twenty-one years of
age, and a likely-looking boy.



Joseph Henry Hill. The spirit of freedom in this passenger was truly the
"one idea" notion. At the age of twenty-eight his purpose to free
himself by escaping on the Underground Rail Road was successfully
carried into effect, although not without difficulty. Joseph was a fair
specimen of a man physically and mentally, could read and write, and
thereby keep the run of matters of interest on the Slavery question.

James Thomas, Jr., a tobacco merchant, in Richmond, had Joe down in his
ledger as a marketable piece of property, or a handy machine to save
labor, and make money. To Joe's great joy he heard the sound of the
Underground Rail Road bell in Richmond,--had a satisfactory interview
with the conductor,--received a favorable response, and was soon a
traveler on his way to Canada. He left his mother, a free woman, and two
sisters in chains. He had been sold twice, but he never meant to be sold
again.

ARRIVAL FROM RICHMOND, 1859.


CORNELIUS HENRY JOHNSON. FACE CANADA-WARD FOR YEARS.


Quite an agreeable interview took place between Cornelius and the
Committee. He gave his experience of Slavery pretty fully, and the
Committee enlightened him as to the workings of the Underground Rail
Road, the value of freedom, and the safety of Canada as a refuge.

Cornelius was a single man, thirty-six years of age, full black, medium
size, and intelligent. He stated that he had had his face set toward
Canada for a long while. Three times he had made an effort to get out of
the prison-house. "Within the last four or five years, times have gone
pretty hard with me. My mistress, Mrs. Mary F. Price, had lately put me
in charge of her brother, Samuel M. Bailey, a tobacco merchant of
Richmond. Both believed in nothing as they did in Slavery; they would
sooner see a black man dead than free. They were about second class in
society. He and his sister own well on to one hundred head, though
within the last few years he has been thinning off the number by sale. I
was allowed one dollar a week for my board; one dollar is the usual
allowance for slaves in my situation. On Christmas week he allowed me no
board money, but made me a present of seventy-five cents; my mistress
added twenty-five cents, which was the extent of their liberality. I was
well cared for. When the slaves got sick he doctored them himself, he
was too stingy to employ a physician. If they did not get well as soon
as he thought they should, he would order them to their work, and if
they did not go he would beat them. My cousin was badly beat last year
in the presence of his wife, and he was right sick. Mr. Bailey was a
member of St. James' church, on Fifth street, and my mistress was a
communicant of the First Baptist church on Broad Street. She let on to
be very good."

"I am one of a family of sixteen; my mother and eleven sisters and
brothers are now living; some have been sold to Alabama, and some to
Tennessee, the rest are held in Richmond. My mother is now old, but is
still in the service of Bailey. He promised to take care of her in her
old age, and not compel her to labor, so she is only required to cook
and wash for a dozen slaves. This they consider a great favor to the old
'grandmother.' It was only a year ago he cursed her and threatened her
with a flogging. I left for nothing else but because I was dissatisfied
with Slavery. The threats of my master caused me to reflect on the North
and South. I had an idea that I was not to die in Slavery. I believed
that God would assist me if I would try. I then made up my mind to put
my case in the hands of God, and start for the Underground Rail Road. I
bade good-bye to the old tobacco factory on Seventh street, and the
First African Baptist church on Broad street (where he belonged), where
I had so often heard the minister preach 'servants obey your masters;'
also to the slave pens, chain-gangs, and a cruel master and mistress,
all of which I hoped to leave forever. But to bid good-bye to my old
mother in chains, was no easy job, and if my desire for freedom had not
been as strong as my desire for life itself, I could never have stood
it; but I felt that I could do her no good; could not help her if I
staid. As I was often threatened by my master, with the auction-block, I
felt I must give up all and escape for my life."

Such was substantially the story of Cornelius Henry Johnson. He talked
for an hour as one inspired, and as none but fugitive slaves could talk.

ARRIVAL FROM DELAWARE, 1858.

THEOPHILUS COLLINS, ANDREW JACKSON BOYCE, HANDY BURTON AND ROBERT
JACKSON.


A DESPERATE, BLOODY STRUGGLE--GUN, KNIFE AND FIRE SHOVEL, USED BY AN
INFURIATED MASTER.


Judged from their outward appearance, as well as from the fact that they
were from the neighboring State of Delaware, no extraordinary
revelations were looked for from the above-named party. It was found,
however, that one of their number, at least, had a sad tale of outrage
and cruelty to relate. The facts stated are as follows:



Theophilus is twenty-four years of age, dark, height and stature hardly
medium, with faculties only about average compared with ordinary
fugitives from Delaware and Maryland. His appearance is in no way
remarkable. His bearing is subdued and modest; yet he is not lacking in
earnestness. Says Theophilus, "I was in servitude under a man named
Houston, near Lewes, Delaware; he was a very mean man, he didn't allow
you enough to eat, nor enough clothes to wear. He never allowed a drop
of tea, or coffee, or sugar, and if you didn't eat your breakfast before
day he wouldn't allow you any, but would drive you out without any. He
had a wife; she was mean, too, meaner than he was. Four years ago last
Fall my master cut my entrails out for going to meeting at Daniel
Wesley's church one Sabbath night. Before day, Monday morning, he called
me up to whip me; called me into his dining-room, locked the doors, then
ordered me to pull off my shirt. I told him no, sir, I wouldn't; right
away he went and got the cowhide, and gave me about twenty over my head
with the butt. He tore my shirt off, after I would not pull it off; he
ordered me to cross my hands. I didn't do that. After I wouldn't do that
he went and got his gun. and broke the breech of that over my head. He
then seized up the fire-tongs and struck me over the head ever so often.
The next thing he took was the parlor shovel and he beat on me with that
till he broke the handle; then he took the blade and stove it at my head
with all his might. I told him that I was bound to come out of that
room. He run up to the door and drawed his knife and told me if I
ventured to the door he would stab me. I never made it any better or
worse, but aimed straight for the door; but before I reached it he
stabbed me, drawing the knife (a common pocket knife) as hard as he
could rip across my stomach; right away he began stabbing me about my
head," (marks were plainly to be seen). After a desperate struggle,
Theophilus succeeded in getting out of the building.

[Illustration: ]

"I started," said he, "at once for Georgetown, carrying a part of my
entrails in my hands for the whole journey, sixteen miles. I went to my
young masters, and they took me to an old colored woman, called Judah
Smith, and for five days and nights I was under treatment of Dr. Henry
Moore, Dr. Charles Henry Richards, and Dr. William Newall; all these
attended me. I was not expected to live for a long time, but the Doctors
cured me at last."



Andrew reported that he fled from Dr. David Houston. "I left because of
my master's meanness to me; he was a very mean man to his servants,"
said Andrew, "and I got so tired of him I couldn't stand him any
longer." Andrew was about twenty-six years of age, ordinary size; color,
brown, and was entitled to his freedom, but knew not how to secure it by
law, so resorted to the Underground Rail Road method.



Handy, another of this party, said that he left because the man who
claimed to be his master "was so hard." The man by whom he had been
wronged was known where he came from by the name of Shepherd Burton, and
was in the farming business. "He was a churchman," said Handy, "but he
never allowed me to go to church a half dozen times in my life."



Robert belonged to Mrs. Mary Hickman, at least she had him in her
possession and reaped the benefit of his hire and enjoyed the leisure
and ease thereof while he toiled. For some time prior to his leaving,
this had been a thorn in his side, hard to bear; so when an opening
presented itself by which he thought he could better his condition, he
was ready to try the experiment. He, however, felt that, while she would
not have him to look to for support, she would not be without sympathy,
as she was a member of the Episcopal Church; besides she was an
old-looking woman and might not need his help a great while longer.

ARRIVAL FROM RICHMOND, 1859.


STEPNEY BROWN.


Stepney was an extraordinary man, his countenance indicating great
goodness of heart, and his gratitude to his heavenly Father for his
deliverance proved that he was fully aware of the Source whence his help
had come. Being a man of excellent natural gifts, as well as of
religious fervor and devotion to a remarkable degree, he seemed
admirably fitted to represent the slave in chains, looking up to God
with an eye of faith, and again the fugitive in Canada triumphant and
rejoicing with joy unspeakable over his deliverance, yet not forgetting
those in bonds, as bound with them. The beauty of an unshaken faith in
the good Father above could scarcely have shone with a brighter lustre
than was seen in this simple-hearted believer.

Stepney was thirty-four years of age, tall, slender, and of a dark hue.
He readily confessed that he fled from Mrs. Julia A. Mitchell, of
Richmond; and testified that she was decidedly stingy and unkind,
although a member of St. Paul's church. Still he was wholly free from
acrimony, and even in recounting his sufferings was filled with charity
towards his oppressors. He said, "I was moved to leave because I
believed that I had a right to be a free man."

He was a member of the Second Baptist church, and entertained strong
faith that certain infirmities, which had followed him through life up
to within seven years of the time of his escape, had all been removed
through the Spirit of the Lord. He had been an eye-witness to many
outrages inflicted on his fellow-men. But he spoke more of the
sufferings of others than his own.

His stay was brief, but interesting. After his arrival in Canada he
turned his attention to industrial pursuits, and cherished his loved
idea that the Lord was very good to him. Occasionally he would write to
express his gratitude to God and man, and to inquire about friends in
different localities, especially those in bonds.

The following letters are specimens, and speak for themselves:


    CLIFTON HOUSE, NIAGARA FALLS, August the 27.

    to you a few lines write soon hoping to find you enjoying

    have time to write a few lines to me to let me know how you and
    your family are getting on. No more at present, but I am yours
    very truly,

    STEPNEY BROWN, per Jas. A. Walkinshaw.





    BRANTFORD, Oct. 25, '60

    DEAR SIR:--I take the pleasure of dropping you a few lines, I am
    yet residing in Brantford and I have been to work all this
    summer at the falls and I have got along remarkably well, surely
    God is good to those that put their trust in him I suppose you
    have been wondering what has become of me but I am in the lands
    of living and long to hear from you and your family. I would
    have wrote sooner, but the times has been such in the states I
    have not but little news to send you and I'm going to school

    has become of Julius Anderson and the rest of my friends and
    tell him I would write to him if I knew where to direct the
    letter, please send me word whether any body has been along
    lately that knows me. I know that you are busy but you must take
    time and answer this letter as I am anxious to hear from you,
    but nevertheless we must not forget our maker, so we cannot pray
    too much to our lord so I hope that mr. Anderson has found peace
    with God for me myself really appreciate that hope that I have
    in Christ, for I often find myself in my slumber with you and I
    hope we will meet some day. Mr. Dungy sends his love to you I
    suppose you are aware that he is married, he is luckier than I
    am or I must get a little foothold before I do marry if I ever
    do. I am in a very comfortable room all fixed for the winter and
    we have had one snow. May the lord be with you and all you and
    all your household.

    I remain forever your brother in Christ,

    STEPNEY BROWN.




ARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, 1859.

JIM KELL, CHARLES HEATH, WILLIAM CARLISLE, CHARLES RINGGOLD, THOMAS
MAXWELL, AND SAMUEL SMITH.


On the evening of the Fourth of July, while all was hilarity and
rejoicing the above named very interesting fugitives arrived from the
troubled district, the Eastern shore, of Maryland, where so many
conventions had been held the previous year to prevent escapes; where
the Rev. Samuel Green had been convicted and sent to the penitentiary
for ten years for having a copy of Uncle Tom's Cabin in his humble home;
where so many parties, on escaping, had the good sense and courage to
secure their flight by bringing their masters' horses and carriages a
good way on their perilous journey.

Sam had been tied up and beat many times severely. William had been
stripped naked, and frequently and cruelly cowhided. Thomas had been
clubbed over his head more times than a few. Jim had been whipped with
clubs and switches times without number. Charles had had five men on him
at one time, with cowhides, his master in the lead.



Charles Heath had had his head cut shockingly, with a club, in the hands
of his master; this well cared-for individual in referring to his kind
master, said: "I can give his character right along, he was a perfect
devil. The night we left, he had a woman tied up--God knows what he
done. He was always blustering, you could never do enough for him no
how. First thing in the morning and last thing at night, you would hear
him cussing--he would cuss in bed. He was a large farmer, all the time
drunk. He had a good deal of money but not much character. He was a
savage, bluff, red face-looking concern." Thus, in the most earnest, as
well as in an intelligent manner, Charles described the man (Aquila
Cain), who had hitherto held him under the yoke.



James left his mother, Nancy Kell, two brothers, Robert and Henry, and
two sisters, Mary and Annie; all living in the neighborhood whence he
fled. Besides these, he had eight brothers and sisters living in
Baltimore and elsewhere, under the yoke. He was twenty-four years of
age, of a jet color, but of a manly turn. He fled from Thomas Murphy, a
farmer, and regular slave-holder. Charles Heath was twenty-five years of
age, medium size, full black, a very keen-looking individual.



William was also of unmixed blood, shrewd and wide-awake for his
years,--had been ground down under the heel of Aquila Cain. He left his
mother and two sisters.



Charles Ringgold was eighteen years of age; no white blood showed itself
in the least in this individual. He fled from Dr. Jacob Preston, a
member of the Episcopal Church, and a practical farmer with twenty head
of slaves. "He was not so bad, but his wife was said to be a 'stinger.'"
Charles left his mother and father behind, also four sisters.



Thomas was of pure blood, with a very cheerful, healthy-looking
countenance,--twenty-one years of age, and was to "come free" at
twenty-five, but he had too much good sense to rely upon the promises of
slave-holders in matters of this kind. He too belonged to Cain who, he
said, was constantly talking about selling, etc. He left his father and
mother.

After being furnished with food, clothing, and free tickets, they were
forwarded on in triumph and full of hope.

SUNDRY ARRIVALS, 1859.

JOHN EDWARD LEE, JOHN HILLIS, CHARLES ROSS, JAMES RYAN, WILLIAM
JOHNSTON, EDWARD WOOD, CORNELIUS FULLER AND HIS WIFE HARRIET, JOHN
PINKET, ANSAL CANNON, AND JAMES BROWN.




John came from Maryland, and brought with him a good degree of pluck. He
satisfied the Committee that he fully believed in freedom, and had
proved his faith by his works, as he came in contact with pursuers, whom
he put to flight by the use of an ugly-looking knife, which he plunged
into one of them, producing quite a panic; the result was that he was
left to pursue his Underground Rail Road journey without further
molestation. There was nothing in John's appearance which would lead one
to suppose that he was a blood-thirsty or bad man, although a man of
uncommon muscular powers; six feet high, and quite black, with
resolution stamped on his countenance. But when he explained how he was
enslaved by a man named John B. Slade, of Harford Co., and how, in some
way or other, he became entitled to his freedom, and just as the time
arrived for the consummation of his long prayed-for boon, said Slade was
about to sell him,--after this provocation, it was clear enough to
perceive how John came to use his knife.



John Hillis was a tiller of the ground under a widow lady (Mrs. Louisa
Le Count), of the New Market District, Maryland. He signified to the
mistress, that he loved to follow the water, and that he would be just
as safe on water as on land, and that he was discontented. The widow
heard John's plausible story, and saw nothing amiss in it, so she
consented that he should work on a schooner. The name of the craft was
"Majestic." The hopeful John endeavored to do his utmost to please, and
was doubly happy when he learned that the "Majestic" was to make a trip
to Philadelphia. On arriving John's eyes were opened to see that he owed
Mrs. Le Count nothing, but that she was largely indebted to him for
years of unrequited toil; he could not, therefore, consent to go back to
her. He was troubled to think of his poor wife and children, whom he had
left in the hands of Mrs. Harriet Dean, three quarters of a mile from
New Market; but it was easier for him to imagine plans by which he could
get them off than to incur the hazard of going back to Maryland;
therefore he remained in freedom.



Charles Ross was clearly of the opinion that he was free-born, but that
he had been illegally held in Slavery, as were all his brothers and
sisters, by a man named Rodgers, a farmer, living near Greensborough, in
Caroline county, Md. Very good reasons were given by Charles for the
charge which he made against Rodgers, and it went far towards
establishing the fact, that "colored men had no rights which white men
were bound to respect," in Maryland. Although he was only twenty-three
years of age, he had fully weighed the matter of his freedom, and
appeared firmly set against Slavery.



William Johnson was owned by a man named John Bosley, a farmer, living
near Gun Powder Neck, Maryland. One morning he, unexpectedly to William,
gave him a terrible cowhiding, which, contrary to the master's designs,
made him a firm believer in the doctrine of immediate abolition, and he
thought, that from that hour he must do something against the system--if
nothing more than to go to Canada. This determination was so strong,
that in a few weeks afterwards he found himself on the Underground Rail
Road. He left one brother and one sister; his mother was dead, and of
his father's whereabouts he knew nothing. William was nineteen years of
age, brown color, smart and good-looking.



Edward Wood was a "chattel" from Drummerstown, Accomac county, Virginia,
where he had been owned by a farmer, calling himself James White; a man
who "drank hard and was very crabbed," and before Edward left owned
eleven head of slaves. Edward left a wife and three children, but the
strong desire to be free, which had been a ruling passion of his being
from early boyhood, rendered it impossible for him to stay, although the
ties were very hard to break. Slavery was crushing him hourly, and he
felt that he could not submit any longer.



Cornelius Fuller, and his wife, Harriet, escaped together from Kent
county, Maryland. They belonged to separate masters; Cornelius, it was
said, belonged to the Diden Estate; his wife to Judge Chambers, whose
Honor lived in Chestertown. "He is no man for freedom, bless you," said
Harriet. "He owned more slaves than any other man in that part of the
country; he sells sometimes, and he hired out a great many; would hire
them to any kind of a master, if he half killed you." Cornelius and
Harriet were obliged to leave their daughter Kitty, who was thirteen
years of age.

John Pinket and Ansal Cannon took the Underground Rail Road cars at New
Market, Dorchester county, Maryland.



John was a tall young man, of twenty-seven years of age, of an active
turn of mind and of a fine black color. He was the property of Mary
Brown, a widow, firmly grounded in the love of Slavery; believing that a
slave had no business to get tired or desire his freedom. She sold one
of John's sisters to Georgia, and before John fled, had still in her
possession nine head of slaves. She was a member of the Methodist church
at East New Market. From certain movements which looked very suspicious
in John's eyes, he had been allotted to the Southern Market, he
therefore resolved to look out for a habitation in Canada. He had a
first-rate corn-field education, but no book learning. Up to the time of
his escape, John had shunned entangling himself with a wife.



Ansal was twenty-five years of age, well-colored, and seemed like a
good-natured and well-behaved article. He escaped from Kitty Cannon,
another widow, who owned nine chattels. "Sometimes she treated her
slaves pretty well," was the testimony of Ansal. He ran away because he
did not get pay for his services. In thus being deprived of his hire, he
concluded that he had no business to stay if he could get away.

ARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, 1859.


JAMES BROWN.


A more giant-like looking passenger than the above named individual had
rarely ever passed over the road. He was six feet three inches high, and
in every respect, a man of bone, sinew and muscle. For one who had
enjoyed only a field hand's privileges for improvement, he was not to be
despised.

Jim owed service to Henry Jones; at least he admitted that said Jones
claimed him, and had hired him out to himself for seven dollars per
month. While this amount seemed light, it was much heavier than Jim felt
willing to meet solely for his master's benefit. After giving some heed
to the voice of freedom within, he considered that it behooved him to
try and make his way to some place where men were not guilty of wronging
their neighbors out of their just hire. Having heard of the Underground
Rail Road running to Canada, he concluded to take a trip and see the
country, for himself; so he arranged his affairs with this end in view,
and left Henry Jones with one less to work for him for nothing. The
place that he fled from was called North Point, Baltimore county. The
number of fellow-slaves left in the hands of his old master, was
fifteen.

ARRIVAL FROM DELAWARE, 1859.

EDWARD, JOHN, AND CHARLES HALL.


The above named individuals were brothers from Delaware. They were
young; the eldest being about twenty, the youngest not far from
seventeen years of age.



Edward was serving on a farm, under a man named Booth. Perceiving that
Booth was "running through his property" very fast by hard drinking,
Edward's better judgment admonished him that his so-called master would
one day have need of more rum money, and that he might not be too good
to offer him in the market for what he would bring. Charles resolved
that when his brothers crossed the line dividing Delaware and
Pennsylvania, he would not be far behind.

The mother of these boys was freed at the age of twenty-eight, and lived
in Wilmington, Delaware. It was owing to the fact that their mother had
been freed that they entertained the vague notion that they too might be
freed; but it was a well established fact that thousands lived and died
in such a hope without ever realizing their expectations. The boys, more
shrewd and wide awake than many others, did not hearken to such "stuff."
The two younger heard the views of the elder brother, and expressed a
willingness to follow him. Edward, becoming satisfied that what they
meant to do must be done quickly, took the lead, and off they started
for a free State.



John was owned by one James B. Rodgers, a farmer, and "a most every kind
of man," as John expressed himself; in fact John thought that his owner
was such a strange, wicked, and cross character that he couldn't tell
himself what he was. Seeing that slaves were treated no better than dogs
and hogs, John thought that he was none too young to be taking steps to
get away.



Charles was held by James Rodgers, Sr., under whom he said that he had
served nine years with faint prospects of some time becoming free, but
when, was doubtful.

ARRIVAL FROM VIRGINIA, 1859.

JAMES TAYLOR, ALBERT GROSS, AND JOHN GRINAGE.


To see mere lads, not twenty-one years of age, smart enough to outwit
the very shrewdest and wisest slave-holders of Virginia was very
gratifying. The young men composing this arrival were of this
keen-sighted order.



James was only a little turned of twenty, of a yellow complexion, and
intelligent. A trader, by the name of George Ailer, professed to own
James. He said that he had been used tolerable well, not so bad as many
had been used. James was learning the carpenter trade; but he was
anxious to obtain his freedom, and finding his two companions true on
the main question, in conjunction with them he contrived a plan of
escape, and 'took out.' His father and mother, Harrison and Jane Taylor,
were left at Fredericksburg to mourn the absence of their son.



Albert was in his twentieth year, the picture of good health, not homely
by any means, although not of a fashionable color. He was under the
patriarchal protection of a man by the name of William Price, who
carried on farming in Cecil county, Maryland. Albert testified that he
was a bad man.



John Grinage was only twenty, a sprightly, active young man, of a brown
color. He came from Middle Neck, Cecil county, where he had served under
William Flintham, a farmer.

SUNDRY ARRIVALS FROM MARYLAND (1859)


AND OTHER PLACES.

JAMES ANDY WILKINS, and wife LUCINDA, with their little boy, CHARLES,
CHARLES HENRY GROSS, A WOMAN with her TWO CHILDREN--one in her
arms--JOHN BROWN, JOHN ROACH, and wife LAMBY, and HENRY SMALLWOOD.


The above-named passengers did not all come from the same place, or
exactly at the same time; but for the sake of convenience they are thus
embraced under a general head.



James Andy Wilkins "gave the slip" to a farmer, by the name of George
Biddle, who lived one mile from Cecil, Cecil county, Maryland. While he
hated Slavery, he took a favorable view of his master in some respects
at least, as he said that he was a "moderate man in talk;" but "sly in
action." His master provided him with two pairs of pantaloons in the
summer, and one in the winter, also a winter jacket, no vest, no cap, or
hat. James thought the sum total for the entire year's clothing would
not amount to more than ten dollars. Sunday clothing he was compelled to
procure for himself by working of nights; he made axe handles, mats,
etc., of evenings, and caught musk rats on Sunday, and availed himself
of their hides to procure means for his most pressing wants. Besides
these liberal privileges his master was in the habit of allowing him two
whole days every harvest, and at Christmas from twenty-five cents to as
high as three dollars and fifty cents, were lavished upon him.

His master was a bachelor, a man of considerable means, and "kept
tolerable good company," and only owned two other slaves, Rachel Ann
Dumbson and John Price.



Lucinda, the companion of James, was twenty-one years of age,
good-looking, well-formed and of a brown color. She spoke of a man named
George Ford as her owner. He, however, was said to be of the "moderate
class" of slave-holders; Lucinda being the only slave property he
possessed, and she came to him through his wife (who was a Methodist).
The master was an outsider, so far as the Church was concerned. Once in
a great while Lucinda was allowed to go to church, when she could be
spared from her daily routine of cooking, washing, etc. Twice a week she
was permitted the special favor of seeing her husband. These simple
privations not being of a grave character, no serious fault was found
with them; yet Lucinda was not without a strong ground of complaint. Not
long before escaping, she had been threatened with the auction-block;
this fate she felt bound to avert, if possible, and the way she aimed to
do it was by escaping on the Underground Rail Road. Charley, a bright
little fellow only three years of age, was "contented and happy" enough.
Lucinda left her father, Moses Edgar Wright, and two brothers, both
slaves. One belonged to "Francis Crookshanks," and the other to Capt.
Jim Mitchell. Her mother, who was known by the name of Betsy Wright,
escaped when she (Lucinda) was seven years of age. Of her whereabouts
nothing further had ever been heard. Lucinda entertained strong hopes
that she might find her in Canada.



Charles Henry Gross began life in Maryland, and was made to bear the
heat and burden of the day in Baltimore, under Henry Slaughter,
proprietor of the Ariel Steamer. Owing to hard treatment, Charles was
induced to fly to Canada for refuge.



A woman with two children, one in her arms, and the other two years of
age (names, etc., not recorded), came from the District of Columbia.
Mother and children, appealed loudly for sympathy.



John Brown, being at the beck of a man filling the situation of a common
clerk (in the shoe store of McGrunders), became dissatisfied. Asking
himself what right Benjamin Thorn (his professed master) had to his
hire, he was led to see the injustice of his master, and made up his
mind, that he would leave by the first train, if he could get a genuine
ticket _viâ_ the Underground Rail Road. He found an agent and soon had
matters all fixed. He left his father, mother and seven sisters and one
brother, all slaves. John was a man small of stature, dark, with homely
features, but he was very determined to get away from oppression.



John and Lamby Roach had been eating bitter bread under bondage near
Seaford. John was the so-called property of Joshua O'Bear, "a fractious,
hard-swearing man, and when mad would hit one of his slaves with
anything he could get in his hands." John and his companion made the
long journey on foot. The former had been trained to farm labor and the
common drudgery of slave life. Being a man of thirty-three years of age,
with more than ordinary abilities, he had given the matter of his
bondage considerable thought, and seeing that his master "got worse the
older he got," together with the fact, that his wife had recently been
sold, he was strongly stirred to make an effort for Canada. While it was
a fact, that his wife had already been sold, as above stated, the change
of ownership was not to take place for some months, consequently John
"took out in a hurry." His wife was the property of Dr. Shipley, of
Seaford, who had occasion to raise some money for which he gave security
in the shape of this wife and mother. Horsey was the name of the
gentleman from whom it was said that he obtained the favor; so when the
time was up for the payment to be made, the Dr. was not prepared.
Horsey, therefore, claimed the collateral (the wife) and thus she had to
meet the issue, or make a timely escape to Canada with her husband. No
way but walking was open to them. Deciding to come this way, they
prosecuted their journey with uncommon perseverance and success. Both
were comforted by strong faith in God, and believed that He would enable
them to hold out on the road until they should reach friends.



Henry Smallwood saw that he was working every day for nothing, and
thought that he would do better. He described his master (Washington
Bonafont) as a sort of a rowdy, who drank pretty hard, leaving a very
unfavorable impression on Henry's mind, as he felt almost sure such
conduct would lead to a sale at no distant day. So he was cautious
enough to "take the hint in time." Henry left in company with nine
others; but after being two days on the journey they were routed and
separated by their pursuers. At this point Henry lost all trace of the
rest. He heard afterwards that two of them had been captured, but
received no further tidings of the others. Henry was a fine
representative for Canada; a tall, dark, and manly-looking individual,
thirty-six years of age. He left his father and mother behind.

ARRIVAL FROM RICHMOND, 1859.

HENRY JONES AND TURNER FOSTER.




Henry was left free by the will of his mistress (Elizabeth Mann), but
the heirs were making desperate efforts to overturn this instrument. Of
this, there was so much danger with a Richmond court, that Henry feared
that the chances were against him; that the court was not honest enough
to do him justice. Being a man of marked native foresight, he concluded
that the less he talked about freedom and the more he acted the sooner
he would be out of his difficulties. He was called upon, however, to
settle certain minor matters, before he could see his way clear to move
in the direction of Canada; for instance, he had a wife on his mind to
dispose of in some way, but how he could not tell. Again, he was not in
the secret of the Underground Rail Road movement; he knew that many got
off, but how they managed it he was ignorant. If he could settle these
two points satisfactorily, he thought that he would be willing to endure
any sacrifice for the sake of his freedom. He found an agent of the
Underground Rail Road, and after surmounting various difficulties, this
point was settled. As good luck would have it, his wife, who was a free
woman, although she heard the secret with great sorrow, had the good
sense to regard his step for the best, and thus he was free to contend
with all other dangers on the way.

He encountered the usual suffering, and on his arrival experienced the
wonted pleasure. He was a man of forty-one years of age, spare made,
with straight hair, and Indian complexion, with the Indian's aversion to
Slavery.



Turner, who was a fellow-passenger with Henry, arrived also from
Richmond. He was about twenty-one, a bright, smart, prepossessing young
man. He fled from A.A. Mosen, a lawyer, represented to be one of the
first in the city, and a firm believer in Slavery. Turner differed
widely with his master with reference to this question, although, for
prudential reasons, he chose not to give his opinion to said Mosen.

ARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND.


TWO YOUNG MOTHERS, EACH WITH BABES IN THEIR ARMS--ANNA ELIZABETH YOUNG
AND SARAH JANE BELL--WHIPPED TILL THE BLOOD FLOWED.


The appearance of these young mothers at first produced a sudden degree
of pleasure, but their story of suffering quite as suddenly caused the
most painful reflections. It was hardly possible to listen to their
tales of outrage and wrong with composure. Both came from Kent county,
Maryland, and reported that they fled from a man by the name of Massey;
a man of low stature, light-complexioned, with dark hair, dark eyes, and
very quick temper; given to hard swearing as a common practice; also,
that the said Massey had a wife, who was a very tall woman, with blue
eyes, chestnut-colored hair, and a very bad temper; that, conjointly,
Massey and his wife were in the habit of meting out cruel punishment to
their slaves, without regard to age or sex, and that they themselves,
(Anna Elizabeth and Sarah Jane), had received repeated scourgings at the
hands of their master. Anna and Sarah were respectively twenty-four and
twenty-five years of age; Anna was of a dark chestnut color, while Sarah
was two shades lighter; both had good manners, and a fair share of
intelligence, which afforded a hopeful future for them in freedom. Each
had a babe in her arms.



Sarah had been a married woman for three years; her child, a boy, was
eight months old, and was named Garrett Bell. Elizabeth's child was a
girl, nineteen months old, and named Sarah Catharine Young. Elizabeth
had never been married. They had lived with Massey five years up to the
last March prior to their escape, having been bought out of the
Baltimore slave-pen, with the understanding that they were to be free at
the expiration of five years' service under him. The five years had more
than expired, but no hope or sign of freedom appeared. On the other
hand, Massey was talking loudly of selling them again. Threats and fears
were so horrifying to them, that they could not stand it; this was what
prompted them to flee. "As often as six or seven times," said Elizabeth,
"I have been whipped by master, once with the carriage whip, and at
other times with a raw hide trace. The last flogging I received from
him, was about four weeks before last Christmas; he then tied me up to a
locust tree standing before the door, and whipped me to his
satisfaction."



Sarah had fared no better than Elizabeth, according to her testimony.
"Three times," said she, "I have been tied up; the last time was in
planting corn-time, this year. My clothing was all stripped off above my
waist, and then he whipped me till the blood ran down to my heels." Her
back was lacerated all over. She had been ploughing with two horses, and
unfortunately had lost a hook out of her plough; this, she declared was
the head and front of her offending, nothing more. Thus, after all their
suffering, utterly penniless, they reached the Committee, and were in
every respect, in a situation to call for the deepest commiseration.
They were helped and were thankful.

ARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, VIRGINIA, AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

JOHN WESLEY SMITH, ROBERT MURRAY, SUSAN STEWART, AND JOSEPHINE SMITH.




Daniel Hubert was fattening on John Wesley's earnings contrary to his,
John's, idea of right. For a long time John failed to see the remedy,
but as he grew older and wiser the scales fell from his eyes and he
perceived that the Underground Rail Road ran near his master's place,
Cambridge, Md., and by a very little effort and a large degree of
courage and perseverance he might manage to get out of Maryland and on
to Canada, where slave-holders had no more rights than other people.
These reflections came seriously into John's mind at about the age of
twenty-six; being about this time threatened with the auction-block he
bade slavery good-night, jumped into the Underground Rail Road car and
off he hurried for Pennsylvania. His mother, Betsy, one brother, and one
sister were left in the hands of Hubert. John Wesley could pray for them
and wish them well, but nothing more.



Robert Murray became troubled in mind about his freedom while living in
London county, Virginia, under the heel of Eliza Brooks, a widow woman,
who used him bad, according to his testimony. He had been "knocked about
a good deal." A short while before he fled, he stated that he had been
beat brutally, so much so that the idea of escape was beat into him. He
had never before felt as if he dared hope to try to get out of bondage,
but since then his mind had undergone such a sudden and powerful change,
he began to feel that nothing could hold him in Virginia; the place
became hateful to him. He looked upon a slave-holder as a kind of a
living, walking, talking "Satan, going about as a roaring lion seeking
whom he may destroy." He left his wife, with one child; her name was
Nancy Jane, and the name of the offspring was Elizabeth. As Robert had
possessed but rare privileges to visit his wife, he felt it less a trial
to leave than if it had been otherwise. William Seedam owned the wife
and child.



Susan Stewart and Josephine Smith fled together from the District of
Columbia. Running away had been for a long time a favorite idea with
Susan, as she had suffered much at the hands of different masters. The
main cause of her flight was to keep from being sold again; for she had
been recently threatened by Henry Harley, who "followed droving," and
not being rich, at any time when he might be in want of money she felt
that she might have to go. When a girl only twelve years of age, her
young mind strongly revolted against being a slave, and at that youthful
period she tried her fortune at running away. While she was never caught
by her owners, she had the misfortune to fall into the hands of another
slaveholder no better than her old master, indeed she thought that she
found it even worse under him, so far as severe floggings were
concerned. Susan was of a bright brown color, medium size, quick and
active intellectually and physically, and although she had suffered much
from Slavery, as she was not far advanced in years, she might still do
something for herself. She left no near kin that she was aware of.



Josephine fled from Miss Anna Maria Warren, who had previously been
deranged from the effects of paralysis. Josephine regarded this period
of her mistress' sickness as her opportunity for planning to get away
before her mistress came to her senses.

SUNDRY ARRIVALS FROM MARYLAND AND VIRGINIA.

HENRY FIELDS, CHARLES RINGGOLD, WILLIAM RINGGOLD, ISAAC NEWTON AND
JOSEPH THOMAS.


["Five other cases were attended to by Dillwyn Parish and J.C.
White"--other than this no note was made of them.]



Henry Fields took the benefit of the Underground Rail Road at the age of
eighteen. He fled from the neighborhood of Port Deposit while being
"broke in" by a man named Washington Glasby, who was wicked enough to
claim him as his property, and was also about to sell him. This chattel
was of a light yellow complexion, hearty-looking and wide awake.



Charles Ringgold took offence at being whipped like a dog, and the
prospect of being sold further South; consequently in a high state of
mental dread of the peculiar institution, he concluded that freedom was
worth suffering for, and although he was as yet under twenty years of
age, he determined not to remain in Perrymanville, Maryland, to wear the
chains of Slavery for the especial benefit of his slave-holding master
(whose name was inadvertently omitted).



William Ringgold fled from Henry Wallace, of Baltimore. A part of the
time William said he "had had it pretty rough, and a part of the time
kinder smooth," but never had had matters to his satisfaction. Just
before deciding to make an adventure on the Underground Rail Road his
owner had been talking of selling him. Under the apprehension that this
threat would prove no joke, Henry began to study what he had better do
to be saved from the jaws of hungry negro traders. It was not long
before he came to the conclusion that he had best strike out upon a
venture in a Northern direction, and do the best he could to get as far
away as possible from the impending danger threatened by Mr. Wallace.
After a long and weary travel on foot by night, he found himself at
Columbia, where friends of the Underground Rail Road assisted him on to
Philadelphia. Here his necessary wants were met, and directions given
him how to reach the land of refuge, where he would be out of the way of
all slave-holders and slave-traders. Six of his brothers had been sold;
his mother was still in bondage in Baltimore.



Isaac Newton hailed from Richmond, Virginia. He professed to be only
thirty years of age, but he seemed to be much older. While he had had an
easy time in slavery, he preferred that his master should work for
himself, as he felt that it was his bounden duty to look after number
one; so he did not hesitate about leaving his situation vacant for any
one who might desire it, whether white or black, but made a successful
"took out."



Joseph Thomas was doing the work of a so-called master in Prince
George's county, Maryland. For some cause or other the alarm of the
auction-block was sounded in his ears, which at first distracted him
greatly; upon sober reflection it worked greatly to his advantage. It
set him to thinking seriously on the subject of immediate emancipation,
and what a miserable hard lot of it he should have through life if he
did not "pick up" courage and resolution to get beyond the terror of
slave-holders; so under these reflections he found his nerves gathering
strength, his fears leaving him, and he was ready to venture on the
Underground Rail Road. He came through without any serious difficulty.
He left his father and mother, Shadrach and Lucinda Thomas.

ARRIVAL FROM SEAFORD, 1859.


ROBERT BELL AND TWO OTHERS.


Robert came from Seaford, where he had served under Charles Wright, a
farmer, of considerable means, and the owner of a number of slaves, over
whom he was accustomed to rule with much rigor.

Although Robert's master had a wife and five children, the love which
Robert bore them was too weak to hold him; and well adapted as the
system of Slavery might be to render him happy in the service of young
and old masters, it was insufficient for him. Robert found no rest under
Mr. Wright; no privileges, scantily clad, poor food, and a heavy yoke,
was the policy of this "superior." Robert testified, that for the last
five years, matters had been growing worse and worse; that times had
never been so bad before. Of nights, under the new regime, the slaves
were locked up and not allowed to go anywhere; flogging, selling, etc.,
were of every-day occurrence throughout the neighborhood. Finally,
Robert became sick of such treatment, and he found that the spirit of
Canada and freedom was uppermost in his heart. Slavery grew blacker and
blacker, until he resolved to "pull up stakes" upon a venture. The
motion was right, and succeeded.

Two other passengers were at the station at the same time, but they had
to be forwarded without being otherwise noticed on the book.

ARRIVAL FROM TAPPS' NECK, MD., 1859.

LEWIS WILSON, JOHN WATERS, ALFRED EDWARDS AND WILLIAM QUINN.




Lewis' grey hairs signified that he had been for many years plodding
under the yoke. He was about fifty years of age, well set, not tall, but
he had about him the marks of a substantial laborer. He had been brought
up on a farm under H. Lynch, whom Lewis described as "a mean man when
drunk, and very severe on his slaves." The number that he ruled over as
his property, was about twenty. Said Lewis, about two years ago, he shot
a free man, and the man died about two hours afterwards; for this
offence he was not even imprisoned. Lynch also tried to cut the throat
of John Waters, and succeeded in making a frightful gash on his left
shoulder (mark shown), which mark he will carry with him to the grave;
for this he was not even sued. Lewis left five children in bondage,
Horace, John, Georgiana, Louisa and Louis, Jr., owned by Bazil and John
Benson.



John was forty years of age, dark, medium size, and another of Lynch's
"articles." He left his wife Anna, but no children; it was hard to leave
her, but he felt that it would be still harder to live and die under the
usage that he had experienced on Lynch's farm.



Alfred was twenty-two years of age; he was of a full dark color, and
quite smart. He fled from John Bryant, a farmer. Whether he deserved it
or not, Alfred gave him a bad character, at least, with regard to the
treatment of his slaves. He left his father and mother, six brothers and
sisters. Traveling under doubts and fears with the thought of leaving a
large family of his nearest and dearest friends, was far from being a
pleasant undertaking with Alfred, yet he bore up under the trial and
arrived in peace.



"William is twenty-two, black, tall, intelligent, and active," are the
words of the record.

ARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, 1859.


ANN MARIA JACKSON AND HER SEVEN CHILDREN--MARY ANN, WILLIAM HENRY,
FRANCES SABRINA, WILHELMINA, JOHN EDWIN, EBENEZER THOMAS, AND WILLIAM
ALBERT.


The coming of the above named was duly announced by Thomas Garrett:

[Illustration: ]


    WILMINGTON, 11th mo., 21st, 1858.

    DEAR FRIENDS--McKIM AND STILL:--I write to inform you that on
    the 16th of this month, we passed on four able bodied men to
    Pennsylvania, and they were followed last night by a woman and
    her six children, from three or four years of age, up to sixteen
    years, I believe the whole belonged to the same estate, and they
    were to have been sold at public sale, I was informed yesterday,
    but preferred seeking their own master; we had some trouble in
    getting those last safe along, as they could not travel far on
    foot, and could not safely cross any of the bridges on the
    canal, either on foot or in carriage. A man left here two days
    since, with carriage, to meet them this side of the canal, but
    owing to spies they did not reach him till 10 o'clock last
    night; this morning he returned, having seen them about one or
    two o'clock this morning in a second carriage, on the border of
    Chester county, where I think they are all safe, if they can be
    kept from Philadelphia. If you see them they can tell their own
    tales, as I have seen one of them. May He, who feeds the ravens,
    care for them. Yours,

    THOS. GARRETT.


The fire of freedom obviously burned with no ordinary fervor in the
breast of this slave mother, or she never would have ventured with the
burden of seven children, to escape from the hell of Slavery.

Ann Maria was about forty years of age, good-looking, pleasant
countenance, and of a chestnut color, height medium, and intellect above
the average. Her bearing was humble, as might have been expected, from
the fact that she emerged from the lowest depths of Delaware Slavery.
During the Fall prior to her escape, she lost her husband under most
trying circumstances: he died in the poor-house, a raving maniac. Two of
his children had been taken from their mother by her owner, as was usual
with slave-holders, which preyed so severely on the poor father's mind
that it drove him into a state of hopeless insanity. He was a "free man"
in the eye of Delaware laws, yet he was not allowed to exercise the
least authority over his children.

Prior to the time that the two children were taken from their mother,
she had been allowed to live with her husband and children,
independently of her master, by supporting herself and them with the
white-wash brush, wash-tub, etc. For this privilege the mother doubtless
worked with double energy, and the master, in all probability, was
largely the gainer, as the children were no expense to him in their
infancy; but when they began to be old enough to hire out, or bring high
prices in the market, he snatched away two of the finest articles, and
the powerless father was immediately rendered a fit subject for the
mad-house; but the brave hearted mother looked up to God, resolved to
wait patiently until in a good Providence the way might open to escape
with her remaining children to Canada.

Year in and year out she had suffered to provide food and raiment for
her little ones. Many times in going out to do days' work she would be
compelled to leave her children, not knowing whether during her absence
they would fall victims to fire, or be carried off by the master. But
she possessed a well tried faith, which in her flight kept her from
despondency. Under her former lot she scarcely murmured, but declared
that she had never been at ease in Slavery a day after the birth of her
first-born. The desire to go to some part of the world where she could
have the control and comfort of her children, had always been a
prevailing idea with her. "It almost broke my heart," she said, "when he
came and took my children away as soon as they were big enough to hand
me a drink of water. My husband was always very kind to me, and I had
often wanted him to run away with me and the children, but I could not
get him in the notion; he did not feel that he could, and so he stayed,
and died broken-hearted, crazy. I was owned by a man named Joseph Brown;
he owned property in Milford, and he had a place in Vicksburg, and some
of his time he spends there, and some of the time he lives in Milford.
This Fall he said he was going to take four of my oldest children and
two other servants to Vicksburg. I just happened to hear of this news in
time. My master was wanting to keep me in the dark about taking them,
for fear that something might happen. My master is very sly; he is a
tall, slim man, with a smooth face, bald head, light hair, long and
sharp nose, swears very hard, and drinks. He is a widower, and is rich."

On the road the poor mother, with her travel-worn children became
desperately alarmed, fearing that they were betrayed. But God had
provided better things for her; her strength and hope were soon fully
restored, and she was lucky enough to fall into the right hands. It was
a special pleasure to aid such a mother. Her arrival in Canada was
announced by Rev. H. Wilson as follows:


    NIAGARA CITY, Nov. 30th, 1858.

    DEAR BRO. STILL:--I am happy to inform you that Mrs. Jackson and
    her interesting family of seven children arrived safe and in
    good health and spirits at my house in St. Catharines, on
    Saturday evening last. With sincere pleasure I provided for them
    comfort quarters till this morning, when they left for Toronto.
    I got them conveyed there at half fare, and gave them letters of
    introduction to Thomas Henning, Esq., and Mrs. Dr. Willis,
    trusting that they will be better cared for in Toronto than they
    could be at St. Catharines. We have so many coming to us we
    think it best for some of them to pass on to other places. My
    wife gave them all a good supply of clothing before they left
    us. James Henry, an older son is, I think, not far from St.
    Catharine, but has not as yet reunited with the family.
    Faithfully and truly yours,

    HIRAM WILSON.

SUNDRY ARRIVALS FROM VIRGINIA, MARYLAND AND DELAWARE.

LEWIS LEE, ENOCH DAVIS, JOHN BROWN, THOMAS EDWARD DIXON, AND WILLIAM
OLIVER.




Slavery brought about many radical changes, some in one way and some in
another. Lewis Lee was entirely too white for practical purposes. They
tried to get him to content himself under the yoke, but he could not see
the point. A man by the name of William Watkins, living near Fairfax,
Virginia, claimed Lewis, having come by his title through marriage.
Title or no title, Lewis thought that he would not serve him for
nothing, and that he had been hoodwinked already a great while longer
than he should have allowed himself to be. Watkins had managed to keep
him in the dark and doing hard work on the no-pay system up to the age
of twenty-five. In Lewis' opinion, it was now time to "strike out on his
own hook;" he took his last look of Watkins (he was a tall, slim fellow,
a farmer, and a hard drinker), and made the first step in the direction
of the North. He was sure that he was about as white as anybody else,
and that he had as good a right to pass for white as the white folks, so
he decided to do so with a high head and a fearless front. Instead of
skulking in the woods, in thickets and swamps, under cover of the
darkness, he would boldly approach a hotel and call for accommodations,
as any other southern gentleman. He had a little money, and he soon
discovered that his color was perfectly orthodox. He said that he was
"treated first-rate in Washington and Baltimore;" he could recommend
both of these cities. But destitute of education, and coming among
strangers, he was conscious that the shreds of slavery were still to be
seen upon him. He had, moreover, no intention of disowning his origin
when once he could feel safe in assuming his true status. So as he was
in need of friends and material aid, he sought out the Vigilance
Committee, and on close examination they had every reason to believe his
story throughout, and gave him the usual benefit.



Enoch Davis came from within five miles of Baltimore, having been held
by one James Armstrong, "an old grey-headed man," and a farmer, living
on Huxtown Road. Judged from Davis' stand-point, the old master could
never be recommended, unless some one wanted a very hard place and a
severe master. Upon inquiry, it was ascertained that Enoch was moved to
leave on account of the "riot," (John Brown's Harper's Ferry raid),
which he feared would result in the sale of a good many slaves, himself
among the number; he, therefore, "laid down the shovel and the hoe," and
quit the place.



John Brown (this was an adopted name, the original one not being
preserved), left to get rid of his connection with Thomas Stevens, a
grocer, living in Baltimore. John, however, did not live in the city
with said Stevens, but on the farm near Frederick's Mills, Montgomery
county, Maryland. This place was known by the name of "White Hall Farm;"
and was under the supervision of James Edward Stevens, a son of the
above-named Stevens. John's reasons for leaving were not noted on the
book, but his eagerness to reach Canada spoke louder than words,
signifying that the greater the distance that separated him from the old
"White Hall Farm" the better.



Thomas Edward Dixon arrived from near the Trap, in Delaware. He was only
about eighteen years of age, but as tall as a man of ordinary
height;--dark, with a pleasant countenance. He reported that he had had
trouble with a man known by the name of Thomas W.M. McCracken, who had
treated him "bad;" as Thomas thought that such trouble and bad treatment
might be of frequent occurrence, he concluded that he had better go away
and let McCracken get somebody else to fill his place, if he did not
choose to fill it himself. So off Thomas started, and as if by instinct,
he came direct to the Committee. He passed a good examination and was
aided.



William Oliver, a dark, well-made, young man with the best of country
manners, fled from Mrs. Marshall, a lady living in Prince George's
county, Maryland. William had recently been in the habit of hiring his
time at the rate of ten dollars per month, and find himself everything.
The privilege of living in Georgetown had been vouchsafed him, and he
preferred this locality to his country situation. Upon the whole he said
he had been treated pretty well. He was, nevertheless, afraid that times
were growing "very critical," and as he had a pretty good chance, he
thought he had better make use of it, and his arrangements were wisely
made. He had reached his twenty-sixth year, and was apparently well
settled. He left one child, Jane Oliver, owned by Mrs. Marshall.

ARRIVAL FROM DIFFERENT POINTS.

JACOB BROWN, JAMES HARRIS, BENJAMIN PINEY, JOHN SMITH, ANDREW JACKSON,
WILLIAM HUGHES, WESLEY WILLIAMS, ROSANNA JOHNSON, JOHN SMALLWOOD, AND
HENRY TOWNSEND.




Jacob Brown was eating the bread of Slavery in North Carolina. A
name-sake of his by the name of Lewis Brown, living in Washington,
according to the slave code of that city had Jacob in fetters, and was
exercising about the same control over him that he exercised over cattle
and horses. While this might have been a pleasure for the master, it was
painful for the slave. The usage which Jacob had ordinarily received
made him anything but contented.

At the age of twenty, he resolved that he would run away if it cost him
his life. This purpose was made known to a captain, who was in the habit
of bringing passengers from the South to Philadelphia. With an
unwavering faith he took his appointed place in a private part of the
vessel, and as fast as wind and tide would bring the boat he was wafted
on his way Canada-ward. Jacob was a dark man, and about full size, with
hope large.



James Harris escaped from Delaware. A white woman, Catharine Odine by
name, living near Middletown, claimed James as her man; but James did
not care to work for her on the unrequited labor system. He resolved to
take the first train on the Underground Rail Road that might pass that
way. It was not a great while ere he was accommodated, and was brought
safely to Philadelphia. The regular examination was made and he passed
creditably. He was described in the book as a man of yellow complexion,
good-looking, and intelligent. After due assistance, he was regularly
forwarded on to Canada. This was in the month of November, 1856.
Afterwards nothing more was heard of him, until the receipt of the
following letter from Prof. L.D. Mansfield, showing that he had been
reunited to his wife, under amusing, as well as touching circumstances:


    AUBURN, Dec. 15th, '56.

    DEAR BRO. STILL:--A very pleasant circumstance has brought you
    to mind, and I am always happy to be reminded of you, and of the
    very agreeable, though brief acquaintance which we made at
    Philadelphia two years since. Last Thursday evening, while at my
    weekly prayer meeting, our exercises were interrupted by the
    appearance of Bro. Loguen, of Syracuse, who had come on with
    Mrs. Harris in search of her husband, whom he had sent to my
    care three weeks before. I told Bro. L. that no such man had
    been at my house, and I knew nothing of him. But I dismissed the
    meeting, and went with him immediately to the African Church,
    where the colored brethren were holding a meeting. Bro. L.
    looked through the door, and the first person whom he saw was
    Harris. He was called out, when Loguen said, in a rather
    reproving and excited tone, "What are you doing here; didn't I
    tell you to be off to Canada? Don't you know they are after you?
    Come get your hat, and come with us, we'll take care of you."
    The poor fellow was by this time thoroughly frightened, and
    really thought he had been pursued. We conducted him nearly a
    mile, to the hotel where his wife was waiting for him, leaving
    him still under the impression that he was pursued and that we
    were conducting him to a place of safety, or were going to box
    him up to send him to Canada. Bro. L. opened the door of the
    parlor, and introduced him; but he was so frightened that he did
    not know his wife at first, until she called him James, when
    they had a very joyful meeting. She is now a servant in my
    family, and he has work, and doing well, and boards with her. We
    shall do all we can for them, and teach them to read and write,
    and endeavor to place them in a condition to take care of
    themselves. Loguen had a fine meeting in my Tabernacle last
    night, and made a good collection for the cause of the
    fugitives.

    I should be happy to hear from you and your kind family, to whom
    remember me very cordially. Believe me ever truly yours,

    L.D. MANSFIELD.

    Mr. and Mrs. Harris wish to be gratefully remembered to you and
    yours.




Benjamin Piney reported that he came from Baltimore county, Maryland,
where he had been held in subjection to Mary Hawkins. He alleged that he
had very serious cause for grievance; that she had ill-treated him for a
long time, and had of late, threatened to sell him to Georgia. His
brothers and sisters had all been sold, but he meant not to be if he
could help himself. The sufferings that he had been called upon to
endure had opened his eyes, and he stood still to wait for the
Underground Rail Road car, as he anxiously wished to travel north, with
all possible speed. He waited but a little while, ere he was on the
road, under difficulties it is true, but he arrived safely and was
joyfully received. He imagined his mistress in a fit of perplexity, such
as he might enjoy, could he peep at her from Canada, or some safe place.
He however did not wish her any evil, but he was very decided that he
did not want any more to do with her. Benjamin was twenty years of age,
dark complexion, size ordinary, mental capacity, good considering
opportunities.



John Smith was a yellow boy, nineteen years of age, stout build, with,
marked intelligence. He held Dr. Abraham Street responsible for treating
him as a slave. The doctor lived at Marshall District, Harford county,
Maryland. John frankly confessed, to the credit of the doctor, that he
got "a plenty to eat, drink and wear," yet he declared that he was not
willing to remain a slave, he had higher aims; he wanted to be above
that condition. "I left," said he, "because I wanted to see the country.
If he had kept me in a hogshead of sugar, I wouldn't stayed," said the
bright-minded slave youth. "They told me anything--told me to obey my
master, but I didn't mind that. I am going off to see the Scriptures,"
said John.



Andrew Jackson "took out" from near Cecil, Delaware, where he had been
owned by a man calling himself Thomas Palmer, who owned seven or eight
others. His manners were by no means agreeable to Andrew; he was quite
too "blustery," and was dangerous when in one of his fits. Although
Andrew was but twenty-three years of age, he thought that Palmer had
already had much more of his valuable services than he was entitled to,
and he determined, that if he (the master), ever attempted to capture
him, he would make him remember him the longest day he lived.



William Hughes was an Eastern Shore "piece of property" belonging to
Daniel Cox. William had seen much of the dark doings of Slavery, and his
mind had been thoroughly set against the system. True, he had been but
twenty-two years under the heel of his master, but that was sufficient.



Wesley Williams, on his arrival from Warrick, Maryland, testified that
he had been in the hands of a man known by the name of Jack Jones, from
whom he had received almost daily floggings and scanty food. Jones was
his so-called owner. These continual scourgings stirred the spirit of
freedom in Wesley to that degree, that he was compelled to escape for
his life. He left his mother (a free woman), and one sister in Slavery.



Rosanna Johnson, alias Catharine Beige. The spot that Rosanna looked
upon with most dread and where she had suffered as a slave, under a man
called Doctor Street, was near the Rock of Deer Creek, in Harford
county, Maryland.

In the darkness in which Slavery ordinarily kept the fettered and "free
niggers," it was a considerable length of time ere Rosanna saw how
barbarously she and her race were being wronged and ground down--driven
to do unrequited labor--deprived of an education, obliged to receive the
cuffs, kicks, and curses of old or young, who might happen to claim a
title to them. But when she did see her true condition, she was not
content until she found herself on the Underground Rail Road.

Rosanna was about thirty years of age, of a dark color, medium stature,
and intelligent. She left two brothers and her father behind. The
Committee forwarded her on North. From Albany Rose wrote back to inquire
after particular friends, and to thank those who had aided her--as
follows:


    ALBANY, Jan. the 30, 1858.

Smallwood reported that he came from Ellicott's Mills, Maryland; that he
had been restrained of his liberty all his life, by one Samuel Simons,
who had treated him "bad" all the time that he had held him in his
possession. He had, therefore, persuaded himself that Ellicott's Mills
was a poor neighborhood for a colored man who wanted his freedom, and
that all Maryland was no better. He had heard but little of Canada, but
what he had heard pleased him. As to how he should get there, he knew
not; a whisper pointed him to the Underground Rail Road, and told him to
be fearless and take the first train. Sam considered the matter
carefully and concluded that that would be the only way to get off.
Unfortunately his mother and two brothers were left behind in the hands
of Simons.



Henry Townsend ran away from Caroline county, near Purnell P.O.,
Maryland. The name of his reputed owner, according to his statement, was
E. Townsend, a farmer. Against him Henry harbored a very heavy grudge,
and will long hold said Townsend in remembrance for the injury he had
received at his hands on his naked back. The back was shown, and a most
frightful picture was presented; it had been thoroughly cut in all
directions.

Henry was about twenty-one years of age, dark chesnut color, build
substantial. He left behind two brothers and one sister in Slavery. The
Committee comforted him with the usual hospitality.

These passengers arrived the latter part of 1856 and the beginning of
1857.

SUNDRY ARRIVALS FROM MARYLAND, 1860.

WILLIAM CHION AND HIS WIFE, EMMA, EVAN GRAFF, AND FOUR OTHERS.




William and Emma came from Dorchester county, Maryland. The cords of
Slavery had been tightly drawn around them. William was about
twenty-seven years of age, of a dark hue, and of a courageous bearing.
On the score of treatment he spake thus: "I have been treated as bad as
a man could be." Emma, his wife, had seen about the same number of years
that he had, and her lot had been similar to his. Emma said, "My master
never give me the second dress, never attempted such a thing." The
master was called Bushong Blake. William was owned by a Mr. Tubman.
After leaving Slavery, William changed his last name to Williams, and if
he and his wife are now living, they are known only by their adopted
names.



Evan Graff was of square solid build, dark, and smart, age twenty-five.
He fled in company with four others (whose narratives were not written),
from Frederick county, Maryland. Henry Heart, residing at Sam's Creek,
exercised authority over Evan. With this master, said Evan, I have known
hard times. I have been treated as bad as a man could be. I have been
married three years and have not received five dollars in money since,
towards supporting my family. "How have you lived then?" inquired one
who sympathized. "My wife has kept house for a colored gentleman, and
got her board for her services," said Evan. "In what other particulars
have you been treated hard?" was next asked. "Sometimes I hadn't half
clothes enough to keep me warm, through all weathers," answered Evan.
"What put it into your head to leave?" was the third query. "Well, sir,"
said Evan, "I thought to try and do better." How did you make up your
mind to leave your wife and child in Slavery? "Well, sir, I was very
loth to leave my wife and child, but I just thought in this way: I had a
brother who was entitled to his freedom, but he fell out with one of his
young masters, and was just taken up and sold South, and I thought I
might be taken off too, so I thought I would stand as good a chance in
leaving, as if I stayed." Had you a mother and father, brothers and
sisters? inquired a member of the Committee. "Yes, sir," was the prompt
reply. Evan then gave their names thus: "My father's name was Sam Graff,
my mother's name was Becky." Ruth Ann Dorsey, Isaac Hanson (and two
brothers of Evan), Grafton and Allen accompanied him in his flight.
James, Harriet, Charles Albert, Thomas Ephraim, Adeline Matilda, John
Israel and Daniel Buchanan (brothers and sisters of Evan), were all left
in Slavery.

Polly Pool was their mistress, rather had owned them up to within a
short time before the flight of Evan and his comrades, but she had
lately been unfortunate in business, which resulted in a thorough
scattering of the entire family. Some fell into the hands of the
mistress' children, and some into the hands of the grandchildren. In
Evan's opinion she was a tolerable good mistress; his opportunities of
judging, however, had not been very favorable, as he had not been in her
hands a great while.

Luke Goines came from Harper's Ferry, where he was owned by Mrs.
Carroll. Luke first made his way to Baltimore and afterwards to
Philadelphia.

Henson Kelly was owned by Reason Hastell, of Baltimore. Slavery did not
agree with him, and he left to better his condition.

Stafford Smith fled from Westmoreland county, Virginia, where he was
owned by Harriet Parker, a single woman, advanced in years, and the
owner of many slaves "As a mistress, she was very hard. I have been
hired to first one and then another, bad man all along. My mistress was
a Methodist, but she seemed to know nothing about goodness. She was not
in the habit of allowing the slaves any chance at all."

Jenny was about forty-five years of age, a dark mulatto, stature medium,
manners modest and graceful; she had served only in high life; thus she
had acquired a great deal of information. She stated that she was born a
slave, under John Bower, of Rockbridge, Virginia, and that he was the
owner of a large plantation, with a great number of slaves. He was
considered to be a good man to his servants, and was generally beloved
by them. Suddenly, however, he was taken ill with paralysis, which
confined him to his bed. During this illness one of the sons, a young
gentleman, offered an insult to Jenny, for which she felt justified in
administering to him, a severe chastisement. For this grave offence she
was condemned to be sold to a trader by the name of William Watts, who
owned a place in Mississippi. The conditions of sale were that she was
to be taken out of the state and never to be allowed to return. It so
happened, however, before she was removed that Watts, the trader, failed
in order to cheat his creditors it was supposed. Governor McDowell, of
Virginia, was one of those to whom he was largely indebted for a number
of slaves which he, the Governor, had placed in his hands for disposal,
some time before the trader took the benefit. Therefore, as the Governor
was anxious to recover his loss as much as possible, he seized on Jenny.
It was through this interference that the condition relative to her
being sent out of the state was broken.

"The Governor," said Jenny, "was a very fine gentleman, as good as I
could expect of Virginia. He allowed his slaves to raise fowl and hogs,
with many privileges of one kind and another; besides he kept them all
together; but he took sick and died. There was a great change shortly
after that. The slaves were soon scattered like the wind. The Governor
had nine sons and daughters.

After his death Mrs. McDowell, alias Mrs. Sally Thomas, took possession,
and employed an overseer, by the name of Henry Morgan. He was a very
good man in his looks, but a very rascally man; would get drunk, and
sell her property to get whisky. Mrs. McDowell would let him do just as
he pleased. For the slightest complaint the overseer might see fit to
make against any of the slaves, she would tell him to sell them"--"Sell,
Mr. Morgan." "He would treat them worse than he would any dog; would
beat them over the head with great hickory sticks, the same as he would
beat an ox. He would pasture cows and horses on the plantation, and keep
the money. We slaves all knew it, and we told her; but our words would
not go in court against a white man, and until she was told by Mr.
White, and her cousin, Dr. Taylor, and Mr. Barclay, she would not
believe how shamefully this overseer was cheating her. But at last she
was convinced, and discharged him, and hired another by the name of John
Moore. The new one, if anything, was worse than the old one, for he
could do the most unblushing acts of cruelty with pleasure. He was a
demon."

Finally the estate had to be settled, and the property divided. At this
time it was in the hands of the oldest daughter, Mistress Sally, who had
been married to Frank Thomas, the Governor of Maryland. But the Governor
had discarded her for some reason or other, and according to his
published account of her it might seem that he had good reason for doing
so. It was understood that he gave her a divorce, so she was considered
single for life. It was also understood that she was to buy in the
homestead at a moderate price, with as many slaves as she might desire.

Said Jenny, "I was sold at this settlement sale, and bought in by the
'grass widow' for four hundred dollars." The place and a number of
slaves were bought in on terms equally as low. After this the widow
became smitten with a reverend gentleman, by the name of John Miller,
who had formerly lived North; he had been a popular preacher. After a
courtship, which did not last very long, they were married. This took
place three years ago, prior to the writing of this narrative. After the
marriage, Rev. Mr. Miller took up his abode on the old homestead, and
entered upon his duties as a slave-holder in good earnest.

"How did you like him?" inquired a member of the Committee.

"I despised him," was Jenny's prompt answer.

"Why did you despise him?"

"Because he had such mean ways with him," said Jenny. She then went on
to remark as follows:--"Coming there, taking so much authority over
other people's servants. He was so mean that he broke up all the
privileges the servants had before he came. He stopped all hands from
raising chickens, pigs, etc. He don't like to see them hold up their
heads above their shoulders." Didn't he preach? she was asked. "Yes, but
I never heard him preach; I have heard him pray though. On Thursday
nights, when he would not want the servants to go into town to meeting,
he would keep up until it would be too late for them to go. He is now
carrying on the farm, and follows butchering. He has not yet sold any of
the slaves, but has threatened to sell all hands to the trader."

Jenny once had a husband, but he went to Canada, and that was all she
could tell about him, as she had never had a letter or any direct
information from him since he left. That she was childless, she regarded
as a matter of great satisfaction, considering all the circumstances.

ARRIVAL FROM BALTIMORE, 1860.

WILLIAM BROWN, AND JAMES HENSON


Considering themselves trampled upon by their fellow-men, unitedly
resolved to seek a better country.



William was pained with the idea that so much of his time had already
been used up, as he was then thirty-six years of age. Yet he thought
that it would do no good to mourn over the past, but do what he intended
to do quickly. The master whom he had served, he called, "Master
Lynchum." He was a farmer, and knew full well how to use severity with
the slaves; but had never practiced showing favors, or allowing
privileges of any kind. True he did not flog, but he resorted to other
means of punishment when he desired to make the slaves feel that he was
master. William left his mother, Harriet Brown, three sisters, and one
brother,--Francis, Mary, Eliza, and Robert. They were all free but
Eliza.

Seven weeks William and James were under the painful anxiety of trying
to escape, but conscious of the snares and dangers on the road, and
desirous of success, they did not feel at liberty to move, save as they
saw their way clear. This well-exercised sagacity was strongly marked in
the intellectual region of William's head.



James Henson was a man of rather slender build. From exposure in
traveling he took a severe cold and was suffering with sore throat. He
and Mrs. Maria Thomas disagreed. She set herself up to be "Jim's"
mistress and owner. For some cause or other Jim was unwilling to fill
this station longer. He had been hired out by his mistress, who received
one hundred dollars per annum; and, for aught Jim knew, she was pretty
well pleased with him and the money also. She coolly held eleven others
in the same predicament. While Jim found no fault with the treatment
received at the hands of his mistress, he went so far as to say that
"she was a right fine woman," yet, the longer he lived her slave, the
more unhappy he became. Therefore, he decided that he would try and do
better, and accordingly, in company with William he started, success
attending their efforts. James left three sisters and one brother,
Charlotte, Susan, Ellen and Johnson, all slaves.

ARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND.

PHILIP STANTON, RANDOLPH NICHOLS, AND THOMAS DOUGLASS.




Philip had a master by the name of John Smith, whom he was very anxious
to get rid of, but hardly knew how. For a long time, Philip was annoyed
in various ways. Being the only slave on the place, there was no rest
for him. Said Smith was a bachelor, and his mother, who kept house for
him, was quite aged; "she was worse than the old boy wanted her to be, a
more contrary woman never was; she was bad in this way, she was
quarrelsome, and then again she would not give you as much to eat as you
ought to have, and it was pretty rough; nothing but corn bread and the
fattest pork, that was about all. She was a Catholic, and was known by
the name of Mary Eliza Smith." This was Philip's testimony against his
master and mistress. Working on a farm, driving carriage, etc., had been
Philip's calling as a slave. His father and mother were free. His father
had been emancipated, and afterwards had purchased his wife. One sister,
however, was still in Slavery. Philip had scarcely reached his
twenty-second year; he was nevertheless wide-awake and full of courage.



Randolph was still younger; he had only just reached his twentieth year;
was nearly six feet high, athletic, and entertained quite favorable
notions of freedom. He was owned by Mrs. Caroline Brang, a widow; he had
never lived with her, however. Notwithstanding the fact that he had been
held in such unpleasant relations, Randolph held the opinion, that "she
was a tolerable good woman." He had been hired out under Isaac Howard, a
farmer, who was described by Randolph as "a rough man to everybody
around him; he was the owner of slaves, and a member of the Methodist
Church, in the bargain." As if actuated by an evil spirit continually,
he seemed to take delight in "knocking and beating the slaves," and
would compel them to "be out in all weathers not fit to be out in."
Randolph declared that "he had never been allowed a day's schooling in
his life. On the contrary, he had often been threatened with sale, and
his mind had finally become so affected by this fearful looking-for of
evil, that he thought he had better make tracks."

He left his mother, Louisa, three brothers and three sisters, namely:
Andrew, Mary, Charity, Margaret, Lewis and Samuel, all slaves. His
desire to escape brought the thought home to his mind with great
emphasis, that he was parting with his kinsfolk, to see them perhaps, no
more on earth; that however, happily he might be situated in freedom, he
would have the painful reflection ever present with him, that those he
most loved in this world, were slaves--"knocked and beat about--and made
to work out in all weathers." It was this that made many falter and give
up their purpose to gain their freedom by flight, but Randolph was not
one of this class. His young heart loved freedom too well to waver. True
to his love of liberty, he left all, followed the north star, and was
delivered.



Thomas, an older companion of Philip and Randolph, was twenty-five years
of age, full black, and looked as if he could appreciate the schoolroom
and books, and take care of himself in Canada or any other free country.
Mary Howard was the name of the individual that he was compelled to
address as "mistress." He said, however, that "she was a very good woman
to her servants," and she had a great many. She had sons, but they
turned out to be drunkards, and followed no business; at one time, each
of them had been set up in business, but as they would not attend to it,
of course they failed. Money was needed more than ever, through their
intemperate course, consequently the mistress was induced to sell her
large household, as well as her plantation slaves, to Georgia. Thomas
had seen the most of them take up their sorrowful march for said State,
and the only reason that he was not among them, was attributable to the
fact, that he had once been owned and thought pretty well of by the
brother of his mistress, who interceded in Thomas' behalf. This
interference had the desired effect, and Thomas was not sold. Still, his
eyes were fairly opened to see his danger and to learn a valuable lesson
at the same time; he, therefore, profited by it in escaping the first
chance. He left his mother Ann Williams, and one brother, James
Douglass, both slaves.

ARRIVAL FROM FREDERICKSBURG, 1860.


HENRY TUDLE AND WIFE, MARY WILLIAMS.


Henry affirmed, that for the last twenty years, his freedom had been
promised him, and during all these long years, hardly a month had
passed, that he had not fixed his hopes upon a definite time, when his
bondage would end and his freedom commence. But he had been trusting the
word of a slave-holder, who had probably adopted this plan simply with a
view of drawing more willing toil out of him than he could have
accomplished in any other way.

Mary complained that she had suffered severely for food, and likewise
for privileges. Ezra Houpt was the name of Henry's master, and the name
of his mistress was Catharine, she was hasty and passionate; slaves were
shown no quarter under her. Mary was owned by Christian Thomas. He was
said to be not so hard, but his wife was very hard, so much so, that she
would rule both master and slaves. Her name was Mary Elizabeth.



SUNDRY ARRIVALS FROM MARYLAND, 1860.

SAM ARCHER, LEWIS PECK, DAVID EDWARDS, EDWARD CASTING, JOE HENRY, GEORGE
AND ALBERT WHITE, JOSEPH C. JOHNSON, DAVID SNIVELY, AND HENRY DUNMORE.




Sam Archer was to "become free at thirty-five years of age." He had
already served thirty years of this time; five years longer seemed an
age to him. The dangers from other sources presented also a frightful
aspect. Sam had seen too many who had stood exactly in the same
relations to Slavery and freedom, and not a few were held over their
time, or cheated out of their freedom altogether. He stated that his own
mother was "kept over her time," simply "that her master might get all
her children." Two boys and two girls were thus gained, and were slaves
for life. These facts tended to increase Sam's desire to get away before
his time was out; he, therefore, decided to get off via the Underground
Rail Road. He grew very tired of Bell Air, Harford county, Maryland, and
his so-called owner, Thomas Hayes. He said that Hayes had used him
"rough," and he was "tired of rough treatment." So when he got his plans
arranged, one morning when he was expected to go forth to an unrequited
day's labor, he could not be found. Doubtless, his excited master
thought Sam a great thief, to take himself away in the manner that he
did, but Sam was not concerned on this point; all that concerned him was
as to how he could get to Canada the safest and the quickest. When he
reached the Philadelphia station, he felt that the day dawned, his joy
was full, despite the Fugitive Slave Law.



Lewis Peck was a man six feet high, and of the darkest hue. He reported
that he fled from Joseph Bryant, a farmer, who lived near Patapsco
River. Bryant was in the habit of riding around to look after the
slaves. Lewis had become thoroughly disgusted with this manner of
superintending. "I got tired of having Bryant riding after me, working
my life out of me," said Lewis. He was also tired of Bryant's wife; he
said "she was always making mischief, and he didn't like a mischief
maker."

Thus he complained of both master and mistress, seeming not to
understand that he "had no rights which they were bound to respect."



David Edwards broke away from the above named Bryant, at the age of
twenty-four. His testimony fully corroborated that of his comrade, Lewis
Peck. He was also a man of the darkest shade, tall, intellect good, and
wore a pleasant countenance. The ordinary difficulties were experienced,
but all were surmounted without serious harm.



Edward Casting and Joseph Henry were each about seventeen years of age.
Boys, as they were, with no knowledge of the world, they had wisely
resolved not to remain in that condition. Edward fled from Robert Moore,
who lived at Duck Creek. He gave his master the name of being a "bad
man," and refused to recommend him for anything. Being a likely-looking
chattel, he would have doubtless brought seven hundred dollars in the
market.



Joseph Henry came from Queen Ann county, Maryland. He was a well-grown
lad, and showed traces of having been raised without proper care, or
training. For deficiencies in this direction, he charged Greenberry
Parker, his claimant, who he said had treated him "bad." Friends had
helped these boys along.



George and Albert White were brothers. They fled from Cecil county,
Maryland. They escaped from William Parker. "What kind of a man was
William Parker?" they were asked. "He was a big, bad man, no goodness in
him," quickly replied one of the brothers. Their lot in Slavery had not
been different from that of numbers coming from that section of the
State.



Joseph G. Johnson fled from William Jones of Baltimore. He said that his
master kept a grocery store in Pratt street, and owned six head of
slaves; that he was a "good man, and always treated his servants very
well," until about three weeks before he escaped. For some reason
unknown to Joseph, within the time just alluded to, he had sold all his
slaves, with the exception of himself. Joseph was far from being at
ease, as he hourly felt oppressed with the fear that he was to be sold
at an early day.

Summoning courage he started by the Baltimore and Wilmington Rail Road.
In this way he reached Wilmington where he unfortunately fell into the
hands of his master's son, who resided in Wilmington, and happened to
discover Joseph in the cars, (most likely he had been telegraphed to)
and had him arrested and returned. But Joseph did not allow a week to
pass over him before he was ready to make even a still more daring
adventure for his liberty. This time he concluded to try the water; by
great economy he had saved up twenty-five dollars. This was a great deal
to him, but he resolved to give it all willingly to any man who would
secrete him, or procure him a passage to Philadelphia. The right man was
soon found, and Joseph was off again. Good luck attended him, and he
reached the Committee safely. He was in his twenty-third year, a man of
medium size, copper-colored, and of a prepossessing countenance.



David Snively ran away from Frederick, Maryland. He was moved to escape
solely by the love of freedom. His services had been required in the
blacksmith shop, and on the farm under Charles Preston, who claimed to
own him. He had been sold once and brought nine hundred dollars; he
resolved that a similar fate should never overtake him, unless his owner
moved very suddenly in that direction. While Joseph was working daily in
the blacksmith shop, he was planning how to make good his escape. No way
was open but the old route, which led "hard by" many dangers, and was
only accessible now and then through regions where friends were few and
far between. Howbeit he possessed the faith requisite, and was
victorious.

Joseph was twenty-six years of age, of unmixed blood, ordinary size, and
had a commendable share of courage and intellect. He could recommend no
good traits as his master's.



Henry Dunmore had served as a slave up to the age of thirty-five, and
was then on the eve of being sold. As he had endured severe hardship
under his old master John Maldon he was unwilling to try another. While
he gave Maldon credit for being a member of the Methodist Church, he
charged him with treating himself in a most unchristian-like manner. He
testified that Maldon did not allow him half enough to eat; and once he
kept him out in the cold until his toes were frozen off. Consequently it
was not in the heart of Henry to give his master any other than a bad
name. He lived about sixteen miles from Elkton, near Charleston,
Maryland. He was of a dark chestnut color, well-made, and active.

CROSSING THE BAY IN A BATTEAU.


SHARP CONTEST WITH PURSUERS ON WATER. FUGITIVES VICTORIOUS.


THOMAS SIPPLE, and his wife, MARY ANN, HENRY BURKETT, and ELIZABETH, his
wife, JOHN PURNELL, and HALE BURTON. This party were slaves, living near
Kunkletown, in Worcester county, Maryland, and had become restive in
their fetters. Although they did not know a letter of the alphabet, they
were fully persuaded that they were entitled to their freedom. In
considering what way would be safest for them to adopt, they concluded
that the water would be less dangerous than any other route. As the
matter of freedom had been in their minds for a long time, they had
frequently counted the cost, and had been laying by trifling sums of
money which had fallen perchance into their hands. Among them all they
had about thirty dollars. As they could not go by water without a boat,
one of their number purchased an old batteau for the small sum of six
dollars. The Delaware Bay lay between them and the Jersey shore, which
they desired to reach. They did not calculate, however, that before
leaving the Delaware shore they would have to contend with the enemy.
That in crossing, they would lose sight of the land they well
understood. They managed to find out the direction of the shore, and
about the length of time that it might take them to reach it. Undaunted
by the perils before them the party repaired to the bay, and at ten
o'clock, P.M. embarked direct for the other shore.

[Illustration: ]

Near Kate's Hammock, on the Delaware shore, they were attacked by five
white men in a small boat. One of them seized the chain of the
fugitives' boat, and peremptorily claimed it. "This is not your boat, we
bought this boat and paid for it," spake one of the brave fugitives. "I
am an officer, and must have it," said the white man, holding on to the
chain. Being armed, the white men threatened to shoot. Manfully did the
black men stand up for their rights, and declare that they did not mean
to give up their boat alive. The parties speedily came to blows. One of
the white men dealt a heavy blow with his oar upon the head of one of
the black men, which knocked him down, and broke the oar at the same
time. The blow was immediately returned by Thomas Sipple, and one of the
white men was laid flat on the bottom of the boat. The white men were
instantly seized with a panic, and retreated; after getting some yards
off they snapped their guns at the fugitives several times, and one load
of small shot was fired into them. John received two shot in the
forehead, but was not dangerously hurt. George received some in the
arms, Hale Burton got one about his temple, and Thomas got a few in one
of his arms; but the shot being light, none of the fugitives were
seriously damaged. Some of the shot will remain in them as long as life
lasts. The conflict lasted for several minutes, but the victorious
bondmen were only made all the more courageous by seeing the foe
retreat. They rowed with a greater will than ever, and landed on a small
island. Where they were, or what to do they could not tell. One whole
night they passed in gloom on this sad spot. Their hearts were greatly
cast down; the next morning they set out on foot to see what they could
see. The young women were very sick, and the men were tried to the last
extremity; however, after walking about one mile, they came across the
captain of an oyster boat. They perceived that he spoke in a friendly
way, and they at once asked directions with regard to Philadelphia. He
gave them the desired information, and even offered to bring them to the
city if they would pay him for his services. They had about twenty-five
dollars in all. This they willingly gave him, and he brought them
according to agreement. When they found the captain they were not far
from Cape May light-house.

Taking into account the fact that it was night when they started, that
their little boat was weak, combined with their lack of knowledge in
relation to the imminent danger surrounding them, any intelligent man
would have been justified in predicting for them a watery grave, long
before the bay was half crossed. But they crossed safely. They greatly
needed food, clothing, rest, and money, which they freely received, and
were afterwards forwarded to John W. Jones, Underground Rail Road agent,
at Elmira. The subjoined letter giving an account of their arrival was
duly received:


    ELMIRA, June 6th, 1860.

    FRIEND WM. STILL:--All six came safe to this place. The two men
    came last night, about twelve o'clock; the man and woman stopped
    at the depot, and went east on the next train, about eighteen
    miles, and did not get back till to-night, so that the two men
    went this morning, and the four went this evening.

      O, old master don't cry for me,
      For I am going to Canada where colored men are free.


    P.S. What is the news in the city? Will you tell me how many you
    have sent over to Canada? I would like to know. They all send
    their love to you. I have nothing new to tell you. We are all in
    good health. I see there is a law passed in Maryland not to set
    any slaves free. They had better get the consent of the
    Underground Rail Road before they passed such a thing. Good
    night from your friend,

    JOHN W. JONES.

ARRIVAL FROM DORCHESTER CO., 1860.


HARRIET TUBMAN'S LAST "TRIP" TO MARYLAND.


STEPHEN ENNETS and wife, MARIA, with three children, whose names were as
follows: HARRIET, aged six years; AMANDA, four years, and a babe (in the
arms of its mother), three months old.

The following letter from Thomas Garrett throws light upon this arrival:


    WILMINGTON, 12th mo., 1st, 1860.

    RESPECTED FRIEND:--WILLIAM STILL:--I write to let thee know that
    Harriet Tubman is again in these parts. She arrived last evening
    from one of her trips of mercy to God's poor, bringing two men
    with her as far as New Castle. I agreed to pay a man last
    evening, to pilot them on their way to Chester county; the wife
    of one of the men, with two or three children, was left some
    thirty miles below, and I gave Harriet ten dollars, to hire a
    man with carriage, to take them to Chester county. She said a
    man had offered for that sum, to bring them on. I shall be very
    uneasy about them, till I hear they are safe. There is now much
    more risk on the road, till they arrive here, than there has
    been for several months past, as we find that some poor,
    worthless wretches are constantly on the look out on two roads,
    that they cannot well avoid more especially with carriage, yet,
    as it is Harriet who seems to have had a special angel to guard
    her on her journey of mercy, I have hope.

    Thy Friend,

    THOMAS GARRETT.

    N.B. We hope all will be in Chester county to-morrow.


These slaves from Maryland, were the last that Harriet Tubman piloted
out of the prison-house of bondage, and these "came through great
tribulation."

Stephen, the husband, had been a slave of John Kaiger, who would not
allow him to live with his wife (if there was such a thing as a slave's
owning a wife.) She lived eight miles distant, hired her time,
maintained herself, and took care of her children (until they became of
service to their owner), and paid ten dollars a year for her hire. She
was owned by Algier Pearcy. Both mother and father desired to deliver
their children from his grasp. They had too much intelligence to bear
the heavy burdens thus imposed without feeling the pressure a grievous
one.

Harriet Tubman being well acquainted in their neighborhood, and knowing
of their situation, and having confidence that they would prove true, as
passengers on the Underground Rail Road, engaged to pilot them within
reach of Wilmington, at least to Thomas Garrett's. Thus the father and
mother, with their children and a young man named John, found aid and
comfort on their way, with Harriet for their "Moses." A poor woman
escaping from Baltimore in a delicate state, happened to meet Harriet's
party at the station, and was forwarded on with them. They were cheered
with clothing, food, and material aid, and sped on to Canada. Notes
taken at that time were very brief; it was evidently deemed prudent in
those days, not to keep as full reports as had been the wont of the
secretary, prior to 1859. The capture of John Brown's papers and
letters, with names and plans in full, admonished us that such papers
and correspondence as had been preserved concerning the Underground Rail
Road, might perchance be captured by a pro-slavery mob. For a year or
more after the Harper's Ferry battle, as many will remember, the mob
spirit of the times was very violent in all the principal northern
cities, as well as southern ("to save the Union.") Even in Boston,
Abolition meetings were fiercely assailed by the mob. During this
period, the writer omitted some of the most important particulars in the
escapes and narratives of fugitives. Books and papers were sent away for
a long time, and during this time the records were kept simply on loose
slips of paper.

ARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND, 1860.


JERRY MILLS, AND WIFE, DIANA, SON, CORNELIUS, AND TWO DAUGHTERS,
MARGARET, AND SUSAN.


The father of this family was sixty-five years of age, and his working
days were apparently well nigh completed. The mother was fifty-seven
years of age; son twenty-seven; daughters seventeen and fifteen years of
age.

The old man was smart for his years, but bore evidence that much hard
labor had been wrung out of him by Slavery. Diana said that she had been
the mother of twelve children; five had escaped to Canada, three were in
their graves, and three accompanied her; one was left in Maryland. They
had seen hard times, according to the testimony of the old man and his
companion, especially under David Snively, who, however, had been
"removed by the Lord" a number of years prior to their escape; but the
change proved no advantage to them, as they found Slavery no better
under their mistress, the widow, than under their master. Mistress
Snively was said to be close and stingy, and always unfriendly to the
slave. "She never thought you were doing enough." For her hardness of
heart they were sure she would repent some time, but not while she could
hold slaves. The belief was pretty generally entertained with the slaves
that the slaveholder would have to answer for his evil doings in another
world.

TWELVE MONTHS IN THE WOODS, 1860.


HENRY COTTON.


As a slave, subjected to the whims and passions of his master, Henry
made up his mind that he could not stand it longer. The man who mastered
it over him was called Nathaniel Dixon, and lived in Somerset Co., near
Newtown. This Dixon was not content with his right to flog and abuse
Henry as he saw fit, but he threatened to sell him, as he would sell a
hog.

At this time Henry was about twenty-four years of age, but a man of more
substantial parts physically was rarely to be seen. Courage was one of
his prominent traits. This threat only served to arouse him completely.
He had no friends save such as were in the same condition with himself,
nevertheless he determined not to be sold. How he should escape this
fate did not at first present itself. Every thing looked very gloomy;
Slavery he considered as death to him; and since his master had
threatened him, he looked upon him as his greatest enemy, and rather
than continue a slave he preferred living in the swamps with wild
animals. Just one year prior to the time that he made his way North,
determined not to be a slave any longer, he fled to a swamp and made his
way to the most secluded spot that he could find,--to places that were
almost impenetrable so dense were the trees and undergrowth. This was
all the better for Henry, he wanted to get safety; he did not wish
company. He made known his plans to a dear brother, who engaged to
furnish him occasionally with food. Henry passed twelve months in this
way, beholding no human soul save his brother. His brother faithfully
took him food from time to time. The winter weather of 1859 was very
hard, but it was not so hard to bear as his master Nathaniel Dixon. The
will of Henry's old master entitled him to his freedom, but the heirs
had rendered said will null and void; this act in addition to the talk
of selling had its effect in driving him to the woods. For a time he hid
in the hollow of a tree, which went very hard with him, yet he was
willing to suffer anything rather than go back to his so-called master.
He managed finally to make good his escape and came to the Committee for
aid and sympathy, which he received.

ARRIVAL FROM MARYLAND.


WILLIAM PIERCE.


But few passengers expressed themselves in stronger terms in regard to
their so-called masters, than William Pierce, from Long Green. "I fled,"
said he, "from John Hickol, a farmer, about fifty years old, grey-headed
and drinks whiskey very hard--was always a big devil--ill-grained. He
owned fifteen head; he owns three of my brothers. He has a wife, a big
devil, red head; her servants, she wouldn't feed 'em none, except on
corn bread; she would fight and swear too, when she got ready. She and
her husband would quarrel too. A slave man, a deceitful fellow, who had
been put up to watch on one occasion, when the rest of the slaves had
helped themselves to a chicken, and cooked and ate it about midnight,
though he was allowed to share a portion of the feast, was ready enough
to betray them by times next morning. This made master and mistress
'cuss' all hands at a great rate, and master beat all hands except the
one that told. I was caned so badly that it laid me up for several
weeks. I am a little lame yet from the beating."

Such was William's story. He was twenty-three years of age, of a light
brown color, well-made. Judging from his expressions and apparent
feelings against his master and mistress, he would be willing to endure
many years of suffering in Canada snows, before he would apply to them
for care and protection.

A SLAVE CATCHER CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP.


GEORGE F. ALBERTI PERSONATED BY A MEMBER OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE--A
LADY FRIGHTENED BY A PLACARD.


One afternoon, the quiet of the Anti-Slavery Office was suddenly
agitated by the contents of a letter, privately placed in the hands of
J. Miller McKim by one of the clerks of the Philadelphia Ledger office.
Said letter it would seem, had been dropped into the box of the Ledger
office, instead of the U.S. box (one of which, was also in the Ledger
office), through a mistake, and seeing that it bore the name of a
well-known slave-catcher, Alberti, the clerk had a great desire to know
its import. Whether it was or was not sealed, the writer cannot say, it
certainly was not sealed when it reached the Anti-Slavery office. It
stated that a lady from Maryland was then in Philadelphia, stopping at a
boarding-house on Arch Street, and that she was very desirous of seeing
the above-mentioned Alberti, with a view of obtaining his services to
help catch an Underground Rail Road sojourner, whom she claimed as her
property. That she wrote the letter could not be proved, but that it was
sent by her consent, there was no doubt. In order to save the poor
fellow from his impending doom, it seemed that nothing would avail but a
bold strategical movement. Mr. McKim proposed to find some one who would
be willing to answer for Alberti. Cyrus Whitson, a member of the
Committee, in Mr. McKim's judgment, could manage the matter
successfully. At that time, C. Whitson was engaged in the Free Labor
store, at the corner of Fifth and Cherry streets, near the Anti-Slavery
office. On being sent for, he immediately answered the summons, and Mr.
McKim at once made known to him his plan, which was to save a fellow-man
from being dragged back to bondage, by visiting the lady, and
ascertaining from her in conversation the whereabouts of the fugitives,
the names of the witnesses, and all the particulars. Nothing could have
delighted the shrewd Whitson better; he saw just how he could effect the
matter, without the slightest probable failure. So off he started for
the boarding-house.

Arriving, he rang the bell, and when the servant appeared, he asked if
Miss Wilson, from Maryland, was stopping there. "She is," was the
answer. "I wish to see her." "Walk in the parlor, sir." In went Mr. W.,
with his big whiskers. Soon Miss Wilson entered the parlor, a tall, and
rather fine-looking well dressed lady. Mr. Whitson bowing, politely
addressed her, substantially thus:

"I have come to see you instead of Mr. Geo. F. Alberti, to whom you
addressed a note, this morning. Circumstances, over which Mr. A. had no
control, prevented his coming, so I have come, madam, to look after your
business in his place. Now, madam, I wish it to be distinctly understood
in the outset, that whatever transpires between us, so far as this
business is concerned, must be kept strictly confidential, by no means,
must this matter be allowed to leak out; if it does, the darned
abolitionists (excuse me), may ruin me; at any rate we should not be
able to succeed in getting your slave. I am particular on this point,
remember."

"You are perfectly right, Sir, indeed I am very glad that your plan is
to conduct this matter in this manner, for I do not want my name mixed
up with it in any way."

"Very well, madam, I think we understand each other pretty well; now
please give me the name of the fugitive, his age, size, and color, and
where he may be found, how long he has been away, and the witness who
can be relied on to identify him after he is arrested."

Miss Wilson carefully communicated these important particulars, while
Mr. Whitson faithfully penciled down every word. At the close of the
interview he gave her to understand that the matter should be attended
to immediately, and that he thought there would be no difficulty in
securing the fugitive. "You shall hear from me soon, madam, good
afternoon."

In five minutes after this interview Whitson was back to the
Anti-slavery Office with all Miss Wilson's secrets. The first thing to
be attended was to send a messenger to the place where the fugitive was
at work, with a view of securing his safety; this was a success. The man
was found, and, frightened almost out of his wits, he dropped all and
followed the messenger, who bore him the warning. In the meanwhile Mr.
McKim was preparing, with great dispatch, the subjoined document for the
enlightenment and warning of all.




    TO WHOM IT MAY CONCEEN:

    BEWARE OF SLAVE-CATCHERS.

    Miss WILSON, of Georgetown Cross Roads, Kent county, Md., is now
    in the city in pursuit of her alleged slave man, BUTLER. J.M.
    Cummings and John Wilson, of the same place, are understood to
    be here on a similar errand. This is to caution BUTLER and his
    friends to be on their guard. Let them keep clear of the
    above-named individuals. Also, let them have an eye on all
    persons known to be friends of Dr. High, of Georgetown Cross
    Roads, and Mr. D.B. Cummings, who is not of Georgetown Cross
    Roads.

    It is requested that all parties to whom a copy of this may be
    sent will post it in a public place, and that the friends of
    Freedom and Humanity will have the facts herein contained openly
    read in their respective churches.

    escaped from his master unto thee." Deut. xxiii. 15.


This document printed as a large poster, about three feet square, and
displayed in large numbers over the city, attracted much attention and
comment, which facts were quickly conveyed to Miss Wilson, at her
boarding-house. At first, as it was understood, she was greatly shocked
to find herself in everybody's mouth. She unhesitatingly took her
baggage and started for "My Maryland." Thus ended one of the most
pleasant interviews that ever took place between a slave-hunter and the
Vigilance Committee of Philadelphia.

ARRIVAL FROM RICHMOND, 1858.


HENRY LANGHORN _alias_ WM. SCOTT.


This "chattel" from Richmond, Virginia, was of a yellow complexion, with
some knowledge of the arts of reading and writing; he was about
twenty-three years of age and considered himself in great danger of
being subjected to the auction-block by one Charles L. Hobson. Hobson
and Henry had grown up from boyhood together; for years they had even
occupied the same room,--Henry as a servant-boy and protector of his
prospective young master. Under these relations quite strong affinities
were cemented between them, and Henry succeeded in gaining a knowledge
of the alphabet with an occasional lesson in spelling. Both reached
their majority. William was hired out at the American Hotel, and being a
"smart, likely-looking boy," commanded good wages for his young master's
benefit, who had commenced business as a tobacco merchant, with about
seven head of slaves in his possession. A year or two's experiment
proved that the young master was not succeeding as a merchant, and
before the expiration of three years he had sold all his slaves except
Henry. From such indications, Henry was fully persuaded that his time
was well nigh at hand, and great was his anxiety as he meditated over
the auction-block. "In his heart" he resolved time and again that he
would never be sold. It behooved him, therefore, to avert that ill fate.
He at first resolved to buy himself, but in counting the cost he found
that he would by no means be able to accumulate as much money as his
master would be likely to demand for him; he, therefore, abandoned this
idea and turned his attention straightway to the Underground Rail Road,
by which route he had often heard of slaves escaping. He felt the need
of money and that he must make and save an extra quarter whenever he
could; he soon learned to be a very rigid economist, and being
exceedingly accommodating in waiting upon gentlemen at the hotel and at
the springs, he found his little "pile" increasing weekly. His object
was to have enough to pay for a private berth on one of the Richmond
steamers and also to have a little left to fall back on after landing in
a strange land and among strangers. He saved about two hundred dollars
in cash; he was then ready to make a forward move, and he arranged all
his plans with an agent in Richmond to leave by one of the steamers
during the Christmas holidays. "You must come down to the steamer about
dark," said the agent "and if all is right you will see the Underground
Rail Road agent come out with some ashes as a signal, and by this you
may know that all is ready."

"I will be there certain," said Henry. Christmas week he was confident
would be granted as usual as a holiday week; a few days before Christmas
he went to his master and asked permission to spend said holiday with
his mother, in Cumberland county, adding that he would need some
spending money, enough at least to pay his fare, etc. Young master
freely granted his request, wrote him a pass, and doled him out enough
money to pay his fare thence, but concluded that Henry could pay his way
back out of his extra change. Henry expressed his obligations, etc., and
returned to the American Hotel. The evening before the time appointed
for starting on his Underground Rail Road voyage, he had occasion to go
out to see the Underground Rail Road agent, and asked the clerk to give
him a pass. This favor was peremptorily refused. Henry, "not willing to
give it up so," sat down to write a pass for himself; he found it all
that was necessary, and was thus enabled to accomplish his business
satisfactorily. Next day his Christmas holiday commenced, but instead of
his enjoying the sight of his mother, he felt that he had seen her for
the last time in the flesh. It was a sad reflection. That evening at
dark, he was at the wharf, according to promise. The man with the ashes
immediately appeared and signalled him. In his three suits of clothing
(all on his back), he walked on the boat, and was conducted to the coal
covering, where Egyptian darkness prevailed. The appointed hour for the
starting of the steamer, was ten o'clock the following morning. By the
aid of prayer, he endured the suffering that night. No sooner had the
steamer got under way, than a heavy gale was encountered; for between
three and four days the gale and fog combined, threatened the steamer
with a total loss. All the freight on deck, consisting of tobacco and
cotton, had to be thrown overboard, to save the passengers.

Henry, in his state of darkness, saw nothing, nor could he know the
imminent peril that his life was in. Fortunately he was not sea-sick,
but slept well and long on the voyage. The steamer was five days coming.
On landing at Philadelphia, Henry could scarcely see or walk; the spirit
of freedom, however, was burning brightly in the hidden man, and the
free gales of fresh air and a few hours on free soil soon enabled him to
overcome the difficulties which first presented themselves, and he was
soon one of the most joyful mortals living. He tarried two days with his
friends in Philadelphia, and then hastened on to Boston. After being in
Boston two months, he was passing through the market one day, when, to
his surprise, he espied his young master, Charles L. Hobson. Henry was
sure, however, that he was not recognized, but suspected that he was
hunted. Instantly, Henry pulled up his coat collar, and drew his hat
over his face to disguise himself as much as possible; but he could not
wholly recover from the shock he had thus sustained. He turned aside
from the market and soon met a friend formerly from Richmond, who had
been in servitude in the tobacco factory owned by his master. Henry
tried to prevail on him to spot out said Hobson, in the market, and see
if there possibly could be any mistake. Not a step would his friend take
in that direction. He had been away for several years, still he was a
fugitive, and didn't like the idea of renewing his acquaintance with old
or new friends with a white skin from Virginia. Henry, however, could
not content himself until he had taken another good look at Mr. Hobson.
Disguising himself he again took a stroll through the market, looking on
the right and left as he passed along; presently he saw him seated at a
butcher's stall. He examined him to his satisfaction, and then went
speedily to headquarters (the Anti-Slavery Office), made known the fact
of his discovery, and stated that he believed his master had no other
errand to Boston than to capture him. Measures were at once taken to
ascertain if such a man as Charles L. Hobson was booked at any of the
hotels in Boston.

On finding that this was really a fact, Henry was offered and accepted
private quarters with the well-known philanthropist and friend of the
fugitive, Francis Jackson. His house as well as his purse was always
open to the slave. While under the roof of Mr. Jackson, as Hobson
advertised and described Henry so accurately, and offered a reward of
two hundred and fifty dollars for him, Henry's friends thought that they
would return him the compliment by publishing him in the Boston papers
quite as accurately if not with as high a reward for him; they
advertised him after this manner: "Charles L. Hobson, twenty-two years
of age, six feet high, with a slouched hat on, mixed coat, black pants,
with a goatee, is stopping at the Tremont Hotel," &c., &c. This was as a
bomb-shell to Mr. Hobson, and he immediately took the hint, and with his
trunks steered for the sunny South. In a day or two afterwards Henry
deemed it advisable to visit Canada. After arriving there he wrote back
to his young master, to let him know where he was, and why he left, and
what he was doing. How his letter was received Henry was never informed.
For five years he lived in Boston and ran on a boat trading to Canada
East. He saved up his money and took care of himself creditably. He was
soon prepared to go into some business that would pay him better than
running on the boat. Two of his young friends agreed with him that they
could do better in Philadelphia than in Boston, so they came to the City
of Brotherly Love and opened a first-class dining-saloon near Third and
Chestnut streets. For a time they carried on the business with
enterprise and commendable credit, but one of the partners, disgusted
with the prejudices of the city passenger railway cars, felt that he
could no longer live here. Henry, known after leaving Slavery only by
the name of Wm. Scott, quitted the restaurant business and found
employment as a messenger under Thomas A. Scott, Esq., Vice-President of
the Pennsylvania Central Rail Road, where he has faithfully served for
the last four years, and has the prospect of filling the office for many
years to come. He is an industrious, sober, steady, upright, and
intelligent young man, and takes care of his wife and child in a
comfortable three story brick house of his own.

ARRIVAL FROM RICHMOND, 1859.


Miles Robinson was the slave of Mrs. Roberts, a widow lady living in
York County, Virginia. He did not live with her, however, but was hired
out in the city of Richmond. He had been fortunate in falling into hands
that had not treated him harshly. He was not contented, however. Much of
the leisure falling incidentally to his lot from hours of duty, he
devoted to the banjo. As a player on this instrument he had become quite
gifted, but music in Richmond was not liberty. The latter he craved, and
in thought was often far beyond Mason and Dixon's line, enjoying that
which was denied him in Virginia. Although but twenty-two years of age,
Miles was manly, and determination and intelligence were traits strongly
marked in his unusually well-shaped visage. Hearing that he was to be
sold, he conferred not with his mother, brothers, or sisters, (for such
he had living as slaves in Richmond) but resolved to escape by the first
convenience. Turning his attention to the Underground Rail Road, he soon
found an agent who communicated his wishes to one of the colored women
running as cook or chambermaid on one of the Philadelphia and Richmond
steamers, and she was bold enough to take charge of him, and found him a
safe berth in one of the closets where the pots and other cooking
utensils belonged. It was rather rough and trying, but Miles felt that
it was for liberty, and he must pass through the ordeal without
murmuring, which he did, until success was achieved and he found himself
in Philadelphia. Boston being the haven on which his hopes were fixed,
after recruiting a short while in the city he steered for said place.
Finding liberty there as sweet as he had fondly hoped to find it, he
applied himself unceasingly to industrial pursuits, economy, the
improvement of his mind and the elevation of his race. Four years he
passed thus, under the shadow of Bunker Hill, at the end of which time
he invested the earnings, which he had saved, in a business with two
young friends in Philadelphia. All being first-class waiters and
understanding catering, they decided to open a large dining-saloon.
Miles was one of the two friends mentioned in Wm. Scott's narrative, and
as his success and consequent fortunes have been already referred to, it
will suffice here to mention him simply in connection with two contests
that he sustained with the prejudice that sought to drive colored people
from the passenger cars.

At the corner of Fourth and Walnut streets Miles, in company with two
other young men, Wallace and Marshall, one evening in a most orderly
manner, entered the cars and took their seats. The conductor ordered
them on the front platform; they did not budge. He stopped the car and
ordered them out; this did no good. He read rules, and was not a little
embarrassed by these polite and well-dressed young men. Finally he
called for the police, who arrested all three. Miles did not yield his
seat without a struggle. In being pulled out his resistance was such
that several window lights were broken in the car. The police being in
strong force, however, succeeded in marching their prisoners to the
Mayor's police station at the corner of Fifth and Chestnut streets where
they were locked up to await further investigation. The prisoners
thought they were back in "old Virginny" again. Miles gritted his teeth
and felt very indignant, but what could he do? The infamous prejudice
against which they had borne testimony was controlling all the lines of
city passenger railways in Philadelphia. While Miles and his friends
were willing to suffer for a principle, the dirt, filth, cold, and
disagreeableness of the quarters that they most likely would be
compelled to occupy all night and the following day (Sunday) forbade
submission. Added to this Miles felt that his young wife would hardly be
able to contain herself while he was locked up. They sent for the writer
to intercede for them.

At a late hour of the night, after going from the alderman's
boardinghouse to a fire engine house and other places, where it was
supposed that he might probably be found, on going a third time to his
hotel, a little before midnight, he was discovered to be in bed, and it
was then ascertained that he had not been out all the evening. The night
was very stormy. We could not tell whether or not the fruitless chase on
which we had been sent in search of the alderman, was in keeping with
the spirit that had locked the men up, designed to mislead us; he
condescended at last to appear, and accepted our offer to go bail for
all of them, and finally issued a discharge. This was hastily delivered
at the station, and the prisoners were released.

But Miles was not satisfied; he had breathed free air in Massachusetts
for four years, and being a man of high spirit he felt that he must
further test the prejudices of the cars. Consequently one very cold
night, when a deep snow covered the pavements, he was out with his wife,
and thought that he would ride; his wife being fair, he put her on the
car at the corner of Third and Pine streets, and walked to the corner of
Fourth and Pine streets, where he stepped into the car and took his
seat. The conductor straightway ordered him out, on the plea of color.
God had shaded him a little too much. "How is this, my wife is in this
car," spake Miles. All eyes gazed around to see who his wife was. By
this time the car had been stopped, and the wrath of the conductor was
kindled prodigiously. He did not, however, lay violent hands upon Miles.
A late decision in court had taught the police that they had no right to
interfere, except in cases where the peace was actually being broken; so
in order to get rid of this troublesome customer, the car was run off
the track, the shivering passengers all leaving it, as though flying
from a plague, with the exception of Miles, his wife, and another
colored gentleman, who got on with Miles. The conductor then hoisted all
the windows, took out the cushions, and unhitched the horses. But Miles
and his party stood it bravely; Miles burning all the time with
indignation at this exhibition of prejudice in the city of Brotherly
Love. The war was then raging fiercely, and as Miles then felt, he was
almost prepared to say, he didn't care which beat, as the woman said,
when she saw her husband and the bear wrestling. He was compelled to
admit that this prejudice was akin to slavery, and gave to slavery its
chief support.

The occupants of the horseless car, which was being aired so thoroughly,
remained in it for a length of time, until they had sufficiently borne
their testimony, and they too quietly forsook it.

Prior to this event, by his industry and hard-earned savings, Miles had
become the owner of a comfortable brick house, and had made up his mind
to remain a citizen of Philadelphia, but the spirit which prompted the
aforesaid treatment called up within him reflections somewhat similar to
those aroused by Slavery, and it was not a great while before he offered
his property for sale, including his business stand, resolving to return
to Boston. He received an offer for his property, accepted it, pulled up
stakes, and again hopefully turned his face thitherward. The ambitious
Miles commenced business in Chelsea, near Boston, where he purchased
himself a comfortable home; and he has ever since been successfully
engaged in the sale of kerosene oil. Instead of seeking pleasure in the
banjo, as he was wont to do in Virginia, he now finds delight in the
Baptist Church, Rev. Mr. Grimes', of which he is a prominent member, and
in other fields of usefulness tending to elevate and better the
condition of society generally.

ARRIVAL FROM RICHMOND.


JOHN WILLIAM DUNGY.--BROUGHT A PASS FROM EX. GOV. GREGORY.


"He ought to be put in a cage and kept for a show," said Anna Brown,
daughter of the hero, John Brown, at the house of the writer, where she
happened to meet the above named Underground Rail Road passenger. He had
then just returned from Canada, after being a Refugee four years. In the
mean time through the war and the Proclamation of Father Abraham the
fetters had been torn from the limbs of the slave, and the way to
Richmond was open to all. John William on this occasion was on his way
thither to see how his brethren together with their old oppressors
looked facing each other as freemen. Miss Anna Brown was _en route_ to
Norfolk, where she designed to teach a school of the unfettered bondmen.
The return of the Refugee was as unexpected as it was gratifying.
Scarcely had the cordial greetings of the writer and his family ended
and the daughter of Brown been introduced before the writer was plying
his Refugee guest with a multiplicity of questions relative to his
sojourn in Canada, etc. "How have you been getting along in Canada? Do
you like the country?" "First-rate," said John William. "You look as
though you had neither been starved, nor frozen. Have you had plenty of
work, made some money, and taken care of yourself?" "Yes." "When you
were on the Underground Rail Road on your way to Canada you promised
that you were going to keep from all bad habits; how about the
'crittur?' do you take a little sometimes?" "No, I have not drank a drop
since I left the South" replied John William with emphasis. "Good!" "I
suppose you smoke and chew at any rate?" "No, neither. I never think of
such a thing." "Now don't you keep late hours at night and swear
occasionally?" "No, Sir. All the leisure that I have of evenings is
spent over my books as a general thing; I have not fallen into the
fashionable customs of young men." Miss Brown, who had been an attentive
listener, remarked: "HE OUGHT TO BE PUT IN A CAGE, ETC."

[Illustration: ]

He was twenty-seven years of age when he first landed in Philadelphia,
in the month of February, 1860, per steamer Pennsylvania, in which he
had been stowed away in a store-room containing a lot of rubbish and
furniture; in this way he reached City Point; here a family of Irish
emigrants, very dirty, were taken on board, and orders were given that
accommodations should be made for them in the room occupied by J.W. Here
was trouble, but only for a moment. Those into whose charge he had been
consigned on the boat knew that the kettle and pot-closet had often been
used for Underground Rail Road purposes, and he was safely conducted to
quarters among the pots. The room was exceedingly limited, but he stood
it bravely. On landing he was not able to stand. It required not only
his personal efforts but the help of friends to get him in a condition
to walk. No sooner had he stepped on shore, however, than he began to
cry aloud for joy. "Thank God!" rang out sonorously from his overflowing
soul. Alarmed at this indication of gratitude his friends immediately
told him that that would never do; that all hands would be betrayed;
that he was far from being safe in Philadelphia. He suppressed his
emotion. After being delivered into the hands of the Acting Committee,
where he was in more private quarters, he gave full vent to the joy he
experienced on reaching this city. He said that he had been trying
earnestly for five years to obtain his freedom. For this special object
he had saved up sixty-eight dollars and fifteen cents, all of which but
the fifteen cents he willingly paid for his passage on the boat. Fifteen
cents, the balance of his entire capital, was all that he had when he
landed in Philadelphia.

Before leaving the South he was hired in the family of Ex-Governor
Gregory. Of the Governor and his wife he spoke very highly,--said that
they were kind to him and would readily favor him whenever he solicited
them to do so. He stated that after making his arrangements to start, in
order that he might be away several days before being missed, he told
Mrs. Gregory that he would be glad to spend a week with his mother, (she
lived some distance in the country). As he was not feeling very well she
kindly acceded to his request, and told him to ask the Governor for a
pass and some money. The Governor was busy writing, but he at once
granted the prayer, wrote him a pass, gave John five dollars, adding
that he was sorry that he had no more in his pocket, &c. John bowed and
thanked the Governor, and soon got ready for his visit; but his route
lay in a far different direction than that contemplated by the Governor
and his lady. He was aiming for the Underground Rail Road. As has
already been intimated, he was not owned by the Governor, but by the
Ferrell heirs--five children who had moved from Virginia to Alabama
years back. "Every Ferrell that lives is down on slaves; they are very
severe," said John. Yet he had not suffered as many others had who
belonged to them, as he had been a dining-room servant. At one time they
had owned large numbers of slaves, but latterly they had been selling
them off. Contrary to John's wishes his Alabama owners had notified him
as well as the Governor, that in a short while he was to be taken to
Alabama. This induced John to act with great promptness in leaving at
the time that he did.

After passing several years in Canada as has been already noticed, he
returned to Richmond and paid a visit to his old home.

He found that the governor and his wife had both departed, but two of
the daughters (young ladies), still lived. They were both glad to see
him; the younger especially; she told him that she was glad that he
escaped, and that she "prayed for him." The elder remarked that she had
always thought that he was too "good a Christian to run away." Another
thing which she referred to, apparently with much feeling, was this: On
his way to Canada, he wrote to the governor, from Rochester, "that he
need put himself to no trouble in hunting him up, as he had made up his
mind to visit Canada." She thought that John was rather "naughty," to
write thus to her "papa," nevertheless, she was disposed to forgive him,
after she had frankly spoken her mind.

John found Richmond, which so long had held him in chains, fully
humbled, and her slave power utterly cast down. His wondering eyes gazed
until he was perfectly satisfied that it was the Lord's doings, and it
was marvellous in his eyes. He was more than ever resolved to get an
education, and go back to Virginia, to help teach his brethren who had
been so long denied the privilege. It was not long before he was at
Oberlin College, a faithful student, commanding the highest respect from
all the faculty for his good deportment and studious habits.

After advancing rapidly there, the way opened more fully to pursue his
studies with greater facilities and less expense at a college in one of
the Eastern States. He accepted the favors of friends who offered him
assistance, with a view of preparing him for a mission among the
freedmen, believing that he possessed in a high degree, the elements for
a useful worker, preacher, organizer and teacher. As the friends alluded
to, were about taking measures to start a college at Harper's Ferry,
especially for the benefit of the Freedmen, they anticipated making this
latitude the field of his future endeavors, at least for a time. Ere he
graduated in view of the fact that the harvest in the South so urgently
called for laborers, he was solicited to be an agent for the Storer
College,[A] and subsequently to enter upon a mission under the auspices
of the Free-Will Baptists, in Martinsburg, Virginia. For three or four
years he labored in this field with commendable zeal and acceptably,
gathering young and old in day and Sunday-schools, and also organizing
churches. By his constant labors his health became impaired; receiving a
call from a church in Providence, he accepted, not without knowing,
however, that his mission was to be left in faithful hands, to carry on
the good work.

There is still need of efficient laborers in the Shenandoah Valley.
According to the testimony of Mr. Dungy, scores of places may still be
found where the children have no school privileges, and where many, both
old and young, have never had the opportunity of entering a
meeting-house or church since the war, as the spirit of the white
Christians in these regions is greatly embittered against the colored
people, owing to the abolition of Slavery; and they do not invite them
to either church or school. Indeed, the churches are closed against
them. At different times, Mr. Dungy has eloquently represented the
condition of the colored churches of the South, in the city of
Philadelphia. As a speaker, Mr. Dungy is able and interesting, of good
address, remarkably graceful in his manners, and possessing much general
information.

The subjoined letters received from him, while a fugitive in Canada, are
characteristic of the man, and will repay a perusal.


    BRANTFORD, March 3d, 1860.

    MR. WM. STILL, DEAR SIR:--I have seated myself this evening to
    write you a few lines to inform you that I have got through my
    journey, and landed safely in Brantford, where I found my
    friend, Stepney Brown, and we expressed great joy at meeting
    each other, and had a great shaking of hands, and have not got
    done talking yet of the old times we had in Virginia.

    I thank God I am enjoying vigorous health, and hope you all are
    well, as it is written in the first Psalm, "Blessed is the man
    that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in
    the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful."

    I wish you may think of me often and pray for me that I may grow
    a man, one of the followers of our meek and lowly Saviour. Give
    my love to Mrs. Still, and family, and the Rev. Mr. Gibbs, that
    was residing with you when I was there.

    I must now inform you a little about Canada, at least as much of
    it as I have seen and heard. I arrived in the city of Hamilton,
    on the 15th February, 1860, at nine o'clock in the evening, and
    the weather was dreary and cold, and the cars laid over there
    until ten o'clock next day, and I went up into the city and saw
    a portion of it. I then started for Toronto, arrived there same
    day at 12 o'clock. There I met friends from Richmond, remained
    there several days; during the time we had a very extensive snow
    storm, and I took the opportunity of walking around the city
    looking at the elephants, and other great sights. I liked it
    very much; but upon hearing that my friend and brother Stepney
    Brown was in Brantford, I became disatisfied and left for
    Brantford on the 21st February, 1860. I have found it a very
    pleasant, and have been told it is the prettiest place in
    Canada.

    It is built upon the Grand River, which is two hundred miles
    long, and empties into Lake Erie. It rises to a great height
    every spring, and great masses of ice come down, bringing
    bridges, saw-logs, trees, and fairly sweeps everything before
    it. The people who live upon the flats are in great danger of
    being drowned in their houses.

    I got a situation immediately at the Kerby House, by the
    influence of my friend and brother, Stepney Brown, who I must
    say has been very kind to me, as also have the people of
    Brantford. The Kerbey House is the largest hotel in the town
    about 250 rooms, and a stable at the back, with a gas-house of
    its own. No more at present, but remain,

    Yours very respectfully,

    JOHN WILLIAM DUNGY.

    P.S. Write at your earliest convenience, and oblige your friend,
    J.W.D.





    BRANTFORD, April 20th.

    MR. STILL, DEAR SIR:--I feel myself quite lonesome this evening,
    and not hearing from you lately I take this opportunity to drop
    you a few lines. I have not much to say, brother Brown has left
    for the falls, and expects to return next winter. The weather is
    mild and warm at this time; the grass is putting up and begins
    to look like spring. I thank the Lord I am enjoying good health
    at this time. I hope this letter will find you and your family
    well, give my compliments to them all and Mr. Gibbs and the
    young lady that was at your house when I was there. Times has
    been hard this winter, but they are increasing for the better. I
    wrote to you a few days ago, I don't know whether you got my
    letter. I asked in my letter if Mr. Williams was on the
    pennsylvania, that runs from their to Richmond, Va. I should
    have written to him, but I did not know his number, I also named
    a friend of mine, Mr Plumer if he arrives their pleas to tell
    him to come to Brantford, where I am for there are good chances
    for business I think a great deal about my colored brethren in
    the South but I hope to be a benefit to them one of these days.
    We have quite a melancholy affair about one of our colored
    brothers who made his escape from the South those who took him
    up have gone back to obtain witness to convict him for murder.
    These witness is to be here on Monday 23 inst but the defendence
    of the law says they shant take him back unless they bring good
    witness and men of truth I will write you more about it after
    the trial comes of. I must say a little about myself. I want to
    devote myself to study if I can for the next twelve months. I
    expect to leave the Kirby House on the 5th of may. I have taken
    a barber shop which is a very good situation and one hand
    employed with me. I would be much oblige to you if you would
    give me some advice what to do. I sent you the morning herald
    yesterday which contained a accident which occurd on the G.
    trunk R.W. you will see in it that we don't have much politics
    here. The late destructive fire we had I thought it would have
    kept brantford back this summer but it is increasing slowly I
    have nothing more to say at this time. I hope the Lord may bless
    you all and take care of you in this world, and after time
    receive you in his everlasting kingdom through Jesus Christ our
    Lord. Answer this as soon as convenient. Good bye.

    Yours respectfully

    J.W. DUNGY.




        BRANTFORD, C.W., JANUARY 11th, 61.


    MR. WM. STILL, DEAR SIR:--I take this opportunity to drop you a
    few lines to let you hear from me. I am well at this time,
    hoping this will find you the same.

    I acknowledge my great neglectness of you with great regret that
    I have not answered your letter before this, I hope you will
    excuse me as I have succeeded in getting me a wife since I wrote
    to you last.

    My mind has been much taken up in so doing for several months
    past. Give my compliments to your wife and your family, and Mr.
    Gibbs, also hoping they are all well. Tell Mrs. Still to pray
    for me that I may grow in grace and the knowledge of the truth
    as it is in Jesus.

    I often think of you all. I pray that the time may come when we
    will all be men in the United States. We have read here of the
    great disturbance in the South. My prayer is that this may be a
    deathblow to Slavery. Do you ever have any Underground Rail Road
    passengers now? Times have been very prosperous in Canada this
    year.

    The commercial trade and traffic on the railways has been very
    dull for these few months back. Business on the Buffalo and Lake
    Huron railway has been so dull that a great number of the hands
    have been discharged on account of the panic in the South.

    Canada yet cries, Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!

    I must now say a little about my friend and brother Stepney
    Brown, he lived about six months at the Niagara Falls and is now
    going to school here in Brantford, he sends his best respects to
    you all. He and I often sit together at night after the labor of
    the day is over talking about our absent friends wishing we
    could see them once more.

    Mr. Brown and myself have been wishing for one or two of your
    slavery standards and would be much obliged to you if you would
    send some of the latest.

    Please let me hear from you as soon as possible. I must now
    bring my letter to a close and remain your affectionate friend,

    J.W. DUNGY.

    P.S. May the Lord be with you. J.W. DUNGY.

    Address your letter to John W. Dungy, Brantford, C.W.




"AUNT HANNAH MOORE."


In 1854 in company with her so-called Mistress (Mary Moore) Aunt Hannah
arrived in Philadelphia, from Missouri, being _en route_ to California,
where she with her mistress was to join her master, who had gone there
years before to seek his fortune. The mistress having relatives in this
city tarried here a short time, not doubting that she had sufficient
control over Aunt Hannah to keep her from contact with either
abolitionists or those of her own color, and that she would have no
difficulty in taking her with her to her journey's end. If such were her
calculations she was greatly mistaken. For although Aunt Hannah was
destitute of book-learning she was nevertheless a woman of thought and
natural ability, and while she wisely kept her counsel from her mistress
she took care to make her wants known to an abolitionist. She had passed
many years under the yoke, under different owners, and now seeing a ray
of hope she availed herself of the opportunity to secure her freedom.
She had occasion to go to a store in the neighborhood where she was
stopping, and to her unspeakable joy she found the proprietor an
abolitionist and a friend who inquired into her condition and proffered
her assistance. The store-keeper quickly made known her condition at the
Anti-slavery Office, and in double-quick time J.M. McKim and Charles
Wise as abolitionists and members of the Vigilance Committee repaired to
the stopping-place of the mistress and her slave to demand in the name
of humanity and the laws of Pennsylvania that Aunt Hannah should be no
longer held in fetters but that she should be immediately proclaimed
free. In the eyes of the mistress this procedure was so extraordinary
that she became very much excited and for a moment threatened them with
the "broomstick," but her raving had no effect on Messrs. McKim and
Wise, who did not rest contented until Aunt Hannah was safely in their
hands. She had lived a slave in Moore's family in the State of Missouri
about ten years and said she was treated very well, had plenty to eat,
plenty to wear, and a plenty of work. It was prior to her coming into
the possession of Moore that Aunt Hannah had been made to drink the
bitter waters of oppression. From this point, therefore, we shall
present some of the incidents of her life, from infancy, and very nearly
word for word as she related them:

"Moore bought me from a man named McCaully, who owned me about a year. I
fared dreadful bad under McCaully. One day in a rage he undertook to
beat me with the limb of a cherry-tree; he began at me and tried in the
first place to snatch my clothes off, but he did not succeed. After that
he beat the cherry-tree limb all to pieces over me. The first blow
struck me on the back of my neck and knocked me down; his wife was
looking on, sitting on the side of the bed crying to him to lay on.
After the limb was worn out he then went out to the yard and got a lath,
and he come at me again and beat me with that until he broke it all to
pieces. He was not satisfied then; he next went to the fence and tore
off a paling, and with that he took both hands, 'cursing' me all the
time as hard as he could. With an oath he would say, 'now don't you love
me?' 'Oh master, I will pray for you, I would cry, then he would 'cuss'
harder than ever.' He beat me until he was tired and quit. I crept out
of doors and throwed up blood; some days I was hardly able to creep.
With this beating I was laid up several weeks. Another time Mistress
McCaully got very angry. One day she beat me as bad as he did. She was a
woman who would get very mad in a minute. One day she began scolding and
said the kitchen wasn't kept clean. I told her the kitchen was kept as
clean as any kitchen in the place; she spoke very angry, and said she
didn't go by other folks but she had rules of her own. She soon ordered
me to come in to her. I went in as she ordered me; she met me with a
mule-rope, and ordered me to cross my hands. I crossed my hands and she
tied me to the bedstead. Here her husband said, 'my dear, now let me do
the fighting.' In her mad fit she said he shouldn't do it, and told him
to stand back and keep out of the way or I will give you the cowhide she
said to him. He then 'sot' down in a 'cheer' and looked like a man
condemned to be hung; then she whipped me with the cowhide until I sunk
to the floor. He then begged her to quit. He said to his wife she has
begged and begged and you have whipped her enough. She only raged 'wus;'
she turned the butt end of the cowhide and struck me five or six blows
over my head as hard as she could; she then throwed the cowhide down and
told a little girl to untie me. The little girl was not able to do it;
Mr. McCaully then untied me himself. Both times that I was beat the
blood run down from my head to my feet.

"They wouldn't give you anything to eat hardly. McCaully bore the name
of coming by free colored children without buying them, and selling them
afterwards. One boy on the place always said that he was free but had
been kidnapped from Arkansas. He could tell all about how he was
kidnapped, but could not find anybody to do anything for him, so he had
to content himself.

"McCaully bought me from a man by the name of Landers. While in Landers'
hands I had the rheumatism and was not able to work. He was afraid I was
going to die, or he would lose me, and I would not be of any service to
him, so he took and traded me off for a wagon. I was something better
when he traded me off; well enough to be about. My health remained bad
for about four years, and I never got my health until Moore bought me.
Moore took me for a debt. McCaully owed Moore for wagons. I was not born
in Missouri but was born in Virginia. From my earliest memory I was
owned by Conrad Hackler; he lived in Grason County. He was a very poor
man, and had no other slave but me. He bought me before I was quite four
years old, for one hundred dollars. Hackler bought me from a man named
William Scott. I must go back by good rights to the beginning and tell
all: Scott bought me first from a young man he met one day in the road,
with a bundle in his arms. Scott, wishing to know of the young man what
he had in his bundle, was told that he had a baby. 'What are you going
to do with it?' said Scott. The young man said that he was going to take
it to his sister; that its mother was dead, and it had nobody to take
care of it. Scott offered the young man a horse for it, and the young
man took him up. This is the way I was told that Scott came by me. I
never knowed anything about my mother or father, but I have always
believed that my mother was a white woman, and that I was put away to
save her character; I have always thought this. Under Hackler I was
treated more like a brute than a human being. I was fed like the dogs;
had a trough dug out of a piece of wood for a plate. After I growed up
to ten years old they made me sleep out in an old house standing off
some distance from the main house where my master and mistress lived. A
bed of straw and old rags was made for me in a big trough called the tan
trough (a trough having been used for tanning purposes). The cats about
the place came and slept with me, and was all the company I had. I had
to work with the hoe in the field and help do everything in doors and
out in all weathers. The place was so poor that some seasons he would
not raise twenty bushels of corn and hardly three bushels of wheat. As
for shoes I never knowed what it was to have a pair of shoes until I was
grown up. After I growed up to be a woman my master thought nothing of
taking my clothes off, and would whip me until the blood would run down
to the ground. After I was twenty-five years old they did not treat me
so bad; they both professed to get religion about that time; and my
master said he would never lay the weight of his finger on me again.
Once after that mistress wanted him to whip me, but he didn't do it, nor
never whipped me any more. After awhile my master died; if they had gone
according to law I would have been hired out or sold, but my mistress
wanted to keep me to carry on the place for her support. So I was kept
for seven or eight years after his death. It was understood between my
mistress, and her children, and her friends, who all met after master
died, that I was to take care of mistress, and after mistress died I
should not serve anybody else. I done my best to keep my mistress from
suffering. After a few years they all became dissatisfied, and moved to
Missouri. They scattered, and took up government land. Without means
they lived as poor people commonly live, on small farms in the woods. I
still lived with my mistress. Some of the heirs got dissatisfied, and
sued for their rights or a settlement; then I was sold with my child, a
boy."

Thus Aunt Hannah reviewed her slave-life, showing that she had been in
the hands of six different owners, and had seen great tribulation under
each of them, except the last; that she had never known a mother's or a
father's care; that Slavery had given her one child, but no husband as a
protector or a father. The half of what she passed through in the way of
suffering has scarcely been hinted at in this sketch. Fifty-seven years
were passed in bondage before she reached Philadelphia. Under the good
Providence through which she came in possession of her freedom, she
found a kind home with a family of Abolitionists, (Mrs. Gillingham's),
whose hearts had been in deep sympathy with the slave for many years. In
this situation Aunt Hannah remained several years, honest, faithful, and
obliging, taking care of her earnings, which were put out at interest
for her by her friends. Her mind was deeply imbued with religious
feeling, and an unshaken confidence in God as her only trust; she
connected herself with the A.M.E. Bethel Church, of Philadelphia, where
she has walked, blameless and exemplary up to this day. Probably there
is not a member in that large congregation whose simple faith and whose
walk and conversation are more commendable than Aunt Hannah's. Although
she has passed through so many hardships she is a woman of good judgment
and more than average intellect; enjoys good health, vigor, and peace of
mind in her old days, with a small income just sufficient to meet her
humble wants without having to live at service. After living in
Philadelphia for several years, she was married to a man of about her
own age, possessing all her good qualities; had served a life-time in a
highly respectable Quaker family of this city, and had so won the esteem
of his kind employer that at his death he left him a comfortable house
for life, so that he was not under the necessity of serving another. The
name of the recipient of the good Quaker friend's bounty and Aunt
Hannah's companion, was Thomas Todd. After a few years of wedded life,
Aunt Hannah was called upon to be left alone again in the world by the
death of her husband, whose loss was mourned by many friends, both
colored and white, who knew and respected him.



KIDNAPPING OF RACHEL AND ELIZABETH PARKER--MURDER OF JOSEPH C. MILLER IN
1851 AND 1852.


Those who were interested in the Anti-Slavery cause, and who kept posted
with reference to the frequent cases of kidnapping occurring in
different Free States, especially in Pennsylvania, during the twenty
years previous to emancipation, cannot fail to remember the kidnapping
of Rachel and Elizabeth Parker, and the murder of Joseph C. Miller, who
resided in West Nottingham township, Chester county, Pennsylvania, in
the latter part of 1851, and the beginning of 1852.

Both the kidnapping and the murder at the time of the occurrence shocked
and excited the better thinking and humane classes largely, not only in
Pennsylvania, but to a considerable extent over the Northern States. It
may be said, without contradiction, that Chester county, at least, was
never more aroused by any one single outrage that had taken place within
her borders, than by these occurrences. For a long while the interest
was kept alive, and even as lately as the past year (1870), we find the
case still agitating the citizens of Chester county. Judge Benjamin I.
Passmore, of said county, in defence of truth in an exhaustive article
published in the "Village Record," West Chester, Oct. 12th, 1870, gives
a reliable version of the matter, from beginning to end, which we feel
constrained to give in full, as possessing great historical value,
bearing on kidnapping in general, especially in Pennsylvania.


    TOM M'CREARY.

    FRIEND EVANS:--I noticed in the "Village Record," a short time
    since, an article taken from the Delaware "Transcript," an
    obituary notice of the death of the noted character, whose name
    heads this article, in which false statements were made,
    relative to the outrage he committed in kidnapping Rachel and
    Elizabeth Parker, two colored girls who were then, 1851,
    residing in the southern portion of Chester county. In your
    paper of the 13th ult., I also read an answer to the charges and
    insinuations made in the "Transcript," against Joseph C. Miller,
    (whose life was basely destroyed), and other citizens of Chester
    county; as the occurrence took place in my immediate
    neighborhood, and I was familiar with all the facts and
    circumstances, I propose to give a truthful history of that vile
    and wicked transaction.

    In the winter of 1851, the said McCreary in some unexplained
    way, took Elizabeth Parker, one of the said colored girls, from
    the house of one Donally (not McDonald), in the township of East
    Nottingham, where she was living; but little was said about it
    by Donally, or any one else. Soon after, McCreary with two or
    three others of like proclivities, called at the house of Joseph
    C. Miller, in West Nottingham, where Rachel was living, and
    seized her, gagged her, and placed her in a carriage and drove
    off. The screams of Mrs. Miller and her children, soon brought
    the husband and father to the rescue; he pursued them on foot,
    and at a short distance overtook them in a narrow private road,
    disputing with James Pollock, the owner of the land, whose wagon
    prevented them from passing. They turned and took another road,
    and came out at Stubb's Mill, making for the Maryland line with
    all possible speed; they arrived at Perryville before the train
    for Baltimore. Eli Haines and a young man named Wiley, who lived
    near Rising Sun, Maryland, about two miles from Joseph C.
    Miller's, arrived at the same place soon after, intending to go
    to Philadelphia. Mr. Haines knew Rachel, and seeing McCreary
    there, and her so overwhelmed in sorrow, at once guessed the
    situation of affairs, and he and Wiley changed their intentions
    of going to Philadelphia, and went in the same car with McCreary
    and his victim, to Baltimore, and quietly watched what
    disposition would be made of her, as they felt certain pursuit
    would be made.

    As soon as possible, after McCreary had escaped from West
    Nottingham, Joseph C. Miller, William Morris, Abner Richardson,
    Jesse B. Kirk, and H.G. Coates, started in pursuit on horseback;
    when they arrived at Perryville, the train had gone, with the
    kidnapper and the girl; they followed in the next train. Soon
    after they arrived in Baltimore, they were met by Haines and
    Wiley, who had been on the lookout for a pursuing party, and
    they gave the information that Rachel was deposited in
    Campbell's slave-pen. They were directed by an acquaintance of
    one of the party, to Francis S. Cochran, a prominent member of
    the Society of Friends. Francis informed them he was well
    acquainted with Campbell, and he at once accompained them.
    Campbell assured Friend Cochran that whilst he approved of
    Slavery and catching runaway slaves, he despised kidnapping and
    kidnappers; and on the arrival of McCreary, he ordered him to
    remove Rachel forthwith, which he proceeded to do. Friend
    Cochran insisted on going with them, and saw the girl deposited
    in jail to await a legal investigation. By this time it was
    evening, and the Chester county men all went home with Cochran,
    where they had their suppers; the excitement being great, Friend
    Cochran did not consider it safe for them to go to the depot
    direct; he procured their tickets and had them driven by a
    circuitous route to the depot, charging them to keep together,
    and take their seats in the cars at once. Soon after they were
    seated and before the cars started, Miller stepped out on the
    platform to smoke, against the expostulations of his friends.
    Jesse B. Kirk, his brother-in-law and Abner Richardson followed
    immediately, and although they were right at his heels, he was
    gone; they called him by name, and stepped down into the crowd,
    but soon became alarmed for their own safety, and returned to
    their seats. A consultation was held, and it was agreed that
    Wiley, who was least known, and not directly identified with the
    affair, should pass through the train when it started, and see
    if Miller had not mistakenly got into another car. At Stemen's
    Run station, Wiley returned to the party with the sad tidings
    that Joseph C. Miller was not in that train. On consultation, it
    was agreed that Jesse B. Kirk and Abner Richardson should return
    from Perryville in the next train, and prosecute further search
    for Miller. They did so return, and McCreary also returned to
    Baltimore in the same car, he having left Baltimore in the car
    in the evening with the Chester county men; they arrived late in
    the night, and locked themselves up in a room in the first hotel
    they came to. Their search was fruitless, and they were forced
    to return home with the sad tidings that Miller could not be
    found. This intelligence aroused the whole neighborhood; public
    meetings were held to consult about what was best to be done.
    The writer presided at one of those meetings, which was largely
    attended, and it was with difficulty that the people could be
    restrained from organizing an armed force to kidnap and lynch
    McCreary. Better counsels, however, finally prevailed and it was
    resolved to send a party to Baltimore to prosecute further the
    search for Miller. About twenty men volunteered for the service;
    I went to the house of Joseph C. Miller, the morning they were
    to start, but they had met at Lewis Mellrath's, a brother-in-law
    of Miller. I was there endeavoring to console the aged mother
    and distracted wife and children of Joseph C. Miller, when word
    came that he had been found hanging to a limb in the bushes near
    Stemen's Run station, and such a scene of distress I hope may
    never again be my lot to witness; it was heart-rending in the
    extreme.

    The party went to Baltimore, and such was the excitement that it
    was considered unsafe for the party to go out in a body in
    day-time. Levi K. Brown, who then resided in Baltimore, went
    with them by moonlight, and they disinterred the body, which
    they found about two feet under ground, in a rough box, with a
    narrow lid that freely admitted the dirt to surround his body in
    the box. No undertaker in Baltimore could be found that would
    allow the body left at his place of business whilst a coffin was
    prepared, and it was deposited in "Friends'" vault; a coffin was
    finally procured and William Morris and Abner Richardson started
    with it for his home. When they arrived at Perryville no one
    would render them any assistance, and they were compelled to
    leave the corpse in an old saw mill, and walk up to Port
    Deposit, a distance of five miles, in the night, the weather
    being extremely cold, and a deep snow on the ground. There they
    procured horses and a sled and started with the body, but when
    within a short distance of the Pennsylvania line they were
    overtaken by a messenger with a requisition from the Governor of
    Maryland to return the body to Baltimore county, in order that
    an inquisition and post-mortem examination might be held in
    legal form. With sorrowful hearts they turned back; (one of
    these young men told me that at no place south of Port Deposit
    could they get any one to assist them in handling the corpse).
    By this time the affair had created a great excitement, both in
    Chester county and the City of Baltimore. Rev. John M. Dickey,
    Hon. Henry S. Evans, then a member of the Senate. Brinton
    Darlington, then Sheriff of Chester county, and very many of the
    leading men took a deep interest in the matter; we all did our
    part. The Society of Friends in Baltimore took the matter in
    hand, and many other worthy citizens belonging to the
    Presbyterian Church and others lent their aid and influence.
    Hon. Henry S. Evans, who was then in the Senate of Pennsylvania,
    brought the matter before the Legislature, and the result was
    that the Governor appointed Judges Campbell and Bell, the latter
    of our county, to defend these two poor colored girls thus
    foully kidnapped.

    The body of Miller underwent a post-mortem examination in
    Baltimore county, at which a great number of rowdies attended,
    who occupied their time drinking whisky and cursing the
    Pennsylvania Abolitionists; the body finally reached its
    distressed home for interment. Drs. Hutchinson and Dickey were
    called upon to make an examination, at which I was present, and
    all were clearly of opinion that he had been foully murdered.
    His wrists and ankles bore the unmistakable marks of manacles;
    across the abdomen was a black mark as if made by a rope or
    cord; the end of his nose bore marks as if held by some
    instrument of torture. His funeral took place, and his remains
    were followed to the grave by an immense concourse of
    sympathizing friends and neighbors.

    Such, however, was the excitement, that the public demanded a
    further examination; he was disinterred again, and the same two
    eminent physicians made a thorough post-mortem examination, and
    one of them told the writer that there were not two ounces of
    contents in his stomach and bowels, and that there was abundant
    evidence of the presence of arsenic. His remains were again
    interred and suffered to remain undisturbed.

    The theory of his friends was that he had been suddenly snatched
    from the platform of the car in the Baltimore Depot, gagged,
    stripped, and lashed down by the ankles and wrists, and a rope
    across his abdomen, that his nose had been held by some
    instrument, and that he was in this situation drenched with
    arsenic, and puked and purged to death, and that McCreary, or
    some one for him, had heard Wiley repeat at Stemen's Run
    Station, that he was not on the train, conceived the idea of
    taking his body there and hanging it to a tree to convey the
    idea that he had committed suicide at that place, and such was
    the statement published by some of the Maryland newspapers. His
    companions said he eat a very hearty supper that evening at
    Francis S. Cochran's, which with the other facts that his
    clothing were not soiled, and his stomach and bowels were empty,
    goes strongly to substantiate the theory that he had been
    stripped and foully murdered, as above indicated. Never was
    there a more false assertion than that the "broad brimmed
    Quakers in Pennsylvania were accomplices of McCreary," as it is
    well known that opposition to slavery has been a cardinal
    principle of the Society of Friends for a century. And that
    Joseph C. Miller committed suicide because of his being
    implicated in the kidnapping is a base fabrication. I knew
    Joseph C. Miller from boyhood intimately, and I here take
    pleasure in saying that he was an honest, unassuming man, of
    good moral character and stern integrity, and would have spurned
    the idea of any complication, directly or indirectly, with
    slavery or kidnapping.

    It appears his foul murder was not sufficient to satisfy the
    friends of slavery and kidnapping, but an attempt is now made,
    after the victim has slumbered near twenty years in the grave,
    to blast his good name by insinuating that he was a party, or
    implicated in the vile transactions here narrated.

    Rachel remained in jail; Elizabeth, who had been sold to parties
    in New Orleans, was sent for by Campbell, ample security having
    been given that she should be returned if proved to be a slave.
    Their trial finally came on, and after a long and tedious
    investigation they were both proven, by hosts of respectable
    witnesses to be free. They returned to their mother, in Chester
    county, who was still living.

    The Grand Jury of Chester county found a true bill against
    McCreary for kidnapping, a requisition was obtained, and B.
    Darlington, Esq., then High Sheriff, proceeded with it to
    Annapolis; but the Governor of Maryland refused to allow
    McCreary to be arrested in that State.

    Thus terminated this terrible affair, which cost the State of
    Pennsylvania nearly $3000, as well as a heavy expense to many
    citizens of Baltimore, and those of this county who took an
    active part, and whilst it is to be hoped that the principal
    actor in this sad transaction fully atoned for his evil deeds,
    whilst living, and his friends may have had a right to eulogize
    him after death, they should not have gone out of their way to
    traduce other parties, dead and alive, whose reputations were
    known by living witnesses, to be beyond reproach.

ARRIVAL FROM VIRGINIA, 1854.


TUCKER WHITE.


Tucker reported that he fled from Major Isaac Roney, of Dinwiddie
Court-House, Virginia, in the Christmas week prior to his arrival; that
he reached Petersburg and then encountered difficulties of the most
trying nature; he next stopped at City Point, and was equally
unfortunate there. From exposure in the cold he was severely
frost-bitten. While suffering from the frost he was kept in the
poor-house. After partial recovery he made his way to Baltimore and
thence to Philadelphia. Once or twice he was captured and carried back.
The Committee suspected that he was a cunning impostor who had learned
how to tell a tale of suffering simply to excite the sympathies of the
benevolent; yet, with the map of Virginia before them, he proved himself
familiar with localities adjacent to the neighborhood in which he was
raised. Although not satisfied with his statement, the Committee decided
to aid him.

Passmore Williamson, who had taken a deep interest in the examination of
his case, in order to ascertain the facts, addressed the following note
to Major Roney, using as his signature the name of his friend, Wm. J.
Canby:


    PHILADELPHIA, June 24, 1854.

    MAJOR ISAAC RONEY:

    DEAR SIR:--Within a few days past a colored man has been
    traversing the streets of this city, exciting the sympathies of
    the benevolent by the recital of a tale of the hardships he has
    lately passed through. He represents himself to be Tucker White,
    your slave, a carpenter by trade, and that he escaped from your
    service last Christmas. He is quite dark in complexion, rather
    over the medium size, and a little lame; the latter, probably,
    from the effects of frost on his feet, from which, he alleges,
    he suffered severely.

    He seems to be well acquainted with the adjoining localities,
    but altogether his narrative is almost incredible, and I am
    therefore induced to make the inquiry whether such a man has
    escaped from your service or lately left your neighborhood. We
    are perfectly flooded with such vagrants. It would be a great
    relief if some measures could be resorted to to keep them under
    legal restraint. An answer addressed to No. 73 South 4th Street,
    above Walnut, will reach me, and oblige, Yours, &c.

    WM. J. CANBY.


Weeks passed, but no answer came from the Major. All hope was abandoned
of obtaining a more satisfactory clue to the history of Tucker White.
About three months, however, after Mr. Williamson had written, the
appended note came as an answer:


    MR. CANBY:

    Major Roney received a letter from you relative to his boy,
    Tucker White, and has sent me here to inquire of you his
    whereabouts now. If you know anything concerning him and will
    give me such information so I can get him, you will be rewarded
    for your trouble. You will please address,

    No. 147 American Hotel.

    The Major would have sent on sooner but he has been sick, and
    the letter laid in Office several days.


Mr. Canby was at the time ill, and no attention was paid to the
communication. After a day's delay the following note came to hand, but,
as in the former instance, no answer was returned.


    MR. CANBY:

    You will confer a great favor on me by writing me whether you
    were really the author of a letter to Major Isaac Roney, of
    Dinwiddie Court House, Va., relative to his boy Tucker White,
    and if you were the author, please let me know when you last saw
    him, and where. I called at your office yesterday to see you,
    but your cousin (I think he said he was) told me you had the
    cholera, and if you felt well enough you were going to the
    country to-morrow. I hope you will excuse my writing to you
    to-day, on that account. I would not know where to direct a
    letter if I were to wait until to-morrow. If you know anything
    concerning him and will let me know it, so that I can find and
    arrest him, you will very much oblige

    Yours, &c.,

    I.M. TUCKER.

    No. 147 American Hotel.

    Please write me an answer to-day, so I may know how to proceed
    to-morrow. If I find him I will be very happy to see you before
    I leave in behalf of Major Roney, in whose business I am now
    engaged. I.M.T.


Some one, however, who had a hand in the first letter, referred the
Major to Passmore Williamson, Seventh and Arch Streets. To Mr.
Williamson's surprise the individual who had addressed Mr. C. appeared
at his office with the identical letter in his hand that had been
addressed him by Mr. W. (with W.J.C.'s signature.) On addressing Mr. W.
he held out the letter and inquired: "Are you the author of this letter,
sir?" Mr. W. looked at it and remarked that it appeared to have been
written by a man named Canby. "My name is Williamson, but if you will
walk in and take a seat I will attend to you in a few moments."
Accordingly, after occupying a little time in adjusting some papers, he
signified to the stranger that he was ready to answer any of his
questions. Said Mr. W., "I say frankly that I am the author of that
letter." He then paused for a reply. The stranger then said, "I have
come from Virginia in behalf of Major Roney, in search of his boy,
Tucker White; the Major was very anxious to recover him, and he would
gladly reward Mr. W. or anybody else who would aid him in the matter."
He then asked Mr. W. if he knew anything of his whereabouts. Mr. W.
replied: "I do not at present; for a long time I have heard nothing of
him. I must tell you that I am very sorry that Major Roney gave himself
the trouble to send all the way to Philadelphia to re-capture his 'boy
Tucker White,' and with regard to giving information or assistance, I
know of but one or two men in this city who would be mean enough to
stoop to do such dirty work. Geo. F. Alberti, a notorious kidnapper, and
E.D. Ingraham, equally as notorious as a counsel of slave-hunters whom
everybody here despises, might have served you in this matter. I know no
others to recommend; if anybody can find the 'boy,' they can. But should
they find him they will be obliged to take legal steps in arresting him
before they can proceed. In such a case, instead of assisting Major
Roney, I should feel bound to assist Tucker White by throwing every
obstacle that I possibly could in the way of his being carried back to
Virginia; and to close the matter I wish it to be understood that I do
not desire to hold any further correspondence with Major Roney, of
Dinwiddie, Virginia, about his 'boy,' Tucker White."



ARRIVAL FROM NORFOLK.


MARY MILLBURN, _alias_ LOUISA F. JONES, ESCAPED IN MALE ATTIRE.


Neither in personal appearance, manners, nor language, were any traces
of the Peculiar Institution visible in Mary Millburn. On the contrary,
she represented a young lady, with a passable education, and very
refined in her deportment. She had eaten the white bread of Slavery,
under the Misses Chapman, and they had been singularly kind to her,
taking special pains with her in regard to the company she should keep,
a point important to young girls, so liable to exposure as were the
unprotected young females of the South. She being naturally of a happy
disposition, obliging, competent, there was but little room for any jars
in the household, so far as Mary was concerned. Notwithstanding all
this, she was not satisfied; Slavery in its most dreaded aspect, was all
around her, continually causing the heart to bleed and eyes to weep of
both young and old. The auction-block and slave-pen were daily in view.
Young girls as promising as herself, she well knew, had to be exposed,
examined, and sold to the vilest slave-holders living.

[Illustration: ]

With her knowledge of the practical wickedness of the system, how could
she be satisfied? It was impossible! She determined to escape. She could
be accommodated, but with no favored mode of travel. No flowery beds of
ease could be provided in her case, any more than in the case of others.
Mary took the Underground Rail Road enterprise into consideration. The
opportunity of a passage on a steamer was before her to accept or
refuse. The spirit of freedom dictated that she should accept the offer
and leave by the first boat. Admonished that she could reach the boat
and also travel more safely in male attire she at once said, "Any way so
I succeed." It is not to be supposed for a moment, that the effort could
be made without encountering a great "fight of affliction." When the
hour arrived for the boat to start, Mary was nicely secreted in a box
(place), where she was not discovered when the officers made their usual
search. On arriving in Philadelphia, she mingled her rejoicings with the
Committee in testifying to the great advantage of the Underground Rail
Road, and to the carefulness of its agents in guarding against
accidents. After remaining a short time in Philadelphia, she made choice
of Boston as her future residence, and with a letter of introduction to
William Lloyd Garrison, she proceeded thitherward. How she was received,
and what she thought of the place and people, may be gleaned from this
letter (written by herself.)


    BOSTON, May 15th, 1858.

    DEAR FRIEND:--I have selected this oppotunity to write you a few
    lines, hopeing thay may find you and yours enjoying helth and
    happiness. I arrived hear on Thirsday last, and had a lettor of
    intoduction giving to me by one of the gentlemen at the
    Antoslavery office in New York, to Mr. Garrison in Boston, I
    found him and his lady both to bee very clever. I stopped with
    them the first day of my arrivel hear, since that Time I have
    been living with Mrs. Hilliard I have met with so menny of my
    acquaintances hear, that I all most immagion my self to bee in
    the old country. I have not been to Canaday yet, as you
    expected. I had the pleasure of seeing the lettor that you wrote
    to them on the subject. I suffered much on the road with head
    ake but since that time I have no reason to complain, please do
    not for git to send the degarritips in the Shaimpain basket with
    Dr. Lundys, Mr. Lesley said he will send them by express, tell
    Julia kelly, that through mistake, I took one of her pocket
    handkerchift, that was laying on the table, but I shall keep it
    in remembranc of the onner. I must bring my lettor to a close as
    I have nothing more to say, and believe me to be your faithfull
    friend.

    LOUISA P. JONES.

    P.S. Remember me to each, and every member of your familly and
    all Enquiring Friends.


Being of an industrious turn she found a situation immediately, and from
that day to the present, she has sustained an excellent character in
every respect, and as a fashionable dressmaker does a good business.

ARRIVAL OF FIFTEEN FROM NORFOLK, VIRGINIA.


PER SCHOONER--TWICE SEARCHED--LANDED AT LEAGUE ISLAND.

ISAAC FORMAN, HENRY WILLIAMS, WILLIAM SEYMOUR, HARRIET TAYLOR, MARY
BIRD, MRS. LEWEY, SARAH SAUNDERS, SOPHIA GRAY, HENRY GRAY, MARY GRAY,
WINFIELD SCOTT, and three children.


About the 4th of July, 1856, a message reached the Secretary that a
schooner containing fifteen Underground Rail Road passengers, from
Norfolk, Virginia, would be landed near League Island, directly at the
foot of Broad street, that evening at a late hour, and a request
accompanied the message, to the effect that the Committee would be on
hand to receive them. Accordingly the Secretary procured three
carriages, with trustworthy drivers, and between ten and eleven o'clock
at night arrived on the banks of the Schuylkill, where all was quiet as
a "country grave-yard." The moon was shining and soon the mast of a
schooner was discovered. No sign of any other vessel was then in sight.
On approaching the bank, in the direction of the discovered mast, the
schooner was also discovered. The hearts of those on board were swelling
with unutterable joy; yet even at that dead hour of night, far away from
all appearance of foes, no one felt at liberty to give vent to his
feelings other than in a whisper. The name of the captain and schooner
being at once recognized, the first impulse was to jump down on the
deck. Upon second view it was seen that the descent was too great to
admit of such a feat. In a moment we concluded that we could pull them
up the embankment from the deck by taking hold of their hands as they
stood on tip toe.

One after another was pulled up, and warmly greeted, until it came the
turn of a large object, weighing about two hundred and sixty pounds,
full large enough to make two ordinary women. The captain, who had
experienced much inconvenience with her on the voyage, owing to the
space she required chuckled over the fact that the Committee would have
their hands full for once. Poor Mrs. Walker, however, stretched out her
large arms, we seized her hands vigorously; the captain laughing
heartily as did the other passengers at the tug now being made. We
pulled with a will, but Mrs. Walker remained on the deck. A one horse
power was needed. The pullers took breath, and again took hold, this
time calling upon the captain to lay-to a helping hand; the captain
prepared to do so, and as she was being raised, he having a good
foot-hold, placed himself in a position for pushing to the full extent
of his powers, and thus she was safely landed. All being placed in the
carriages, they were driven to the station and comfortably provided for.

On the voyage they had encountered more than the usual dangers. Indeed
troubles began with them before they had set sail from Norfolk. The
first indication of danger manifested itself as they stood on the bank
of the river awaiting the arrival of a small boat which had been engaged
to row them to the schooner. Although they had sought as they supposed a
safe place, sufficiently far from the bounds usually traversed by the
police; still, in the darkness, they imagined they heard watchmen
coming. Just on the edge of the river, opposite where they were waiting,
a boat under repairs was in the stocks. In order to evade the advancing
foe, they all marched into the river, the water being shallow, and with
the vessel for a breastwork hiding them from the shore, there they
remained for an hour and a half. They were thoroughly soaked if nothing
more. However, about ten o'clock a small oyster boat came to their
relief, and all were soon placed aboard the schooner, which was loaded
with corn, etc. All, with the exception of the large woman above
referred to, and one other female, were required to enter a hole
apparently leading through the bottom of the boat, but in reality only a
department which had been expressly constructed for the Underground Rail
Road business, at the expense of the captain, and in accordance with his
own plan.

The entrance was not sufficiently large to admit Mrs. Walker, so she
with another female who was thought "too fat" to endure the close
confinement, was secreted behind some corn back of the cabin, a place so
secluded that none save well-experienced searchers would be likely to
find it. In this way the Captain put out to sea. After some fifteen
hours he deemed it safe to bring his passengers up on deck where they
could inhale pure air which was greatly needed, as they had been
next-door to suffocation and death. The change of air had such an effect
on one of the passengers (Scott) that, in his excitement, he refused to
conform to the orders required; for prudential reasons the Captain,
threatened to throw him over-board. Whereupon Scott lowered his tone.
Before reaching the lock the Captain supposing that they might be in
danger from contact with boats, men, etc., again called upon them "to go
into their hole" under the deck. Not even the big woman was excused now.
She pleaded that she could not get through, her fellow-sufferers said
that she must be got through urging the matter on the ground that they
would have great danger to face. The big woman again tried to effect an
entrance, but in vain. Said one of the more resolute sisters "she must
take off her clothes then, it will never do to have her staying up on
deck to betray all the rest;" thus this resolute stand being unanimous,
the poor woman had to comply, and except a single garment she was as
destitute of raiment as was Mother Eve before she induced Adam to eat of
the forbidden fruit in the garden of Eden. With the help of passengers
below, she was squeezed through, but not without bruising and breaking
the skin considerably where the rub was severest. All were now beneath
the deck, the well-fitting oil-cloth was put over the hole covering the
cabin-floor snugly, and a heavy table was set over the hole. They are
within sight of the lock, but no human beings are visible about the
schooner save the Captain, the mate and a small boy, the son of the
Captain. At the lock not unexpectedly three officers came on board of
the boat and stopped her. The Captain was told that they had received a
telegraphic dispatch from Norfolk to the effect that his boat was
suspected of having slaves secreted thereon. They talked with the
Captain and mate separately for a considerable while, and more closely
did they examine the boy, but gained no information except that "the
yellow-fever had been raging very bad in Norfolk." At this fever-news
the officers were not a little alarmed, and they now lost no time in
attending to their official errand. They searched the cabin where the
two fat women were first secreted, and other parts of the boat pretty
thoroughly. They then commenced taking up the hatchways, but the place
seemed so shockingly perfumed with foul air that the men started back
and declared that nobody could live in such a place, and swore that it
smelt like the yellow-fever; the Captain laughed at them, and signified
that they were perfectly welcome to search to their hearts' content. The
officers concluded that there were no slaves on that boat, that nobody
could live there, etc., etc., asked for their charges ($3), and
discharged the Captain. The children had been put under the influence of
liquor to keep them still, so they made no noise; the others endured
their hour of agony patiently until the lock was safely passed, and the
river reached. Fresh air was then allowed them, and the great danger was
considered overcome. The Captain, however, far from deeming it advisable
to land his live cargo at the wharves of Philadelphia, delivered them at
League Island. The passengers testified that Captain B. was very kind.
They were noticed thus:



Isaac, was about fifty years of age, dark, tall, well-made, intelligent,
and was owned by George Brown, who resided at Deep Creek. Isaac
testified that said Brown had invariably treated him cruelly. For thirty
years Isaac had hired his time, found himself in food, clothing, and
everything, yet as he advanced in years, neither his task, nor his hire
was diminished, but on the contrary his hire of late years had been
increased. He winced under the pressure, and gave himself up to the
study of the Underground Rail Road. While arrangements for fleeing were
pending, he broke the secret to his wife, Polly, in whom he trusted; she
being true to freedom, although sorrowing to part with him, threw no
obstacle in his way. Besides his wife, he had also two daughters, Amanda
A. and Mary Jane, both slaves. Nevertheless, having made up his mind not
to die a slave, he resolved to escape at all hazards.



Henderson belonged to the estate of A. Briggs, which was about to be
settled, and knowing that he was accounted on the inventory as personal
property, he saw that he too would be sold with the rest of the
movables, if he was not found among the missing.

He began to consider what he had endured as a slave, and came to the
conclusion that he had had a "rugged road to hoe all the way along" and
that he might have it much worse if he waited to be sold. The voice of
reason admonished him to escape for his life. In obeying this call he
suffered the loss of his wife, Julia, and two children, who were
fortunately free. Henderson was about thirty-one years of age, stout,
and of healthy appearance, worth in cash perhaps $1200.



William was thirty-four years of age, of a chestnut color, substantial
physical structure, and of good faculties. The man who professed to own
him he called William Taylor, and "he was a very hard man, one of the
kind which could not be pleased, nor give a slave a pleasant answer one
time in fifty." Being thoroughly sick of William Taylor, he fell in love
with the Underground Rail Road and Canada.



Mrs. Walker, the big fat woman, was thirty-eight years of age, and a
pleasant-looking person, of a very dark hue. Besides the struggles
already alluded to, she was obliged to leave her husband. Of her master
she declared that she could "say nothing good." His name was Arthur
Cooper, of Georgetown; she had never lived with him, however; for twenty
years she had hired her time, paying five dollars per month. When young
she scarcely thought of the gross wrongs that were heaped upon her; but
as she grew older, and thought more about her condition, she scouted the
idea that God had designed her to be a slave, and decided that she would
be one to leave Dixey in the first Underground Rail Road train that
might afford her the chance. She determined not to remain even for the
sake of her husband, who was a slave. With such a will, therefore, she
started. Upon leaving Philadelphia, she went with the most of her
company to Boston, and thence to New Bedford, where she was living when
last heard from.



Rebecca Lewey was the wife of a man, who was familiarly known by the
name of "Blue Beard," his proper name being Henry Lewey. For a long
time, although a slave himself, he was one of the most dexterous
managers in the Underground Rail Road agency in Norfolk. No single
chapter in this work could be more interesting than a chapter of his
exploits in this respect.

The appearing of Mrs. Lewey, was a matter of unusual interest. Although
she had worn the yoke, she was gentle in her manners, and
healthy-looking, so much so that no life insurance agent would have had
need to subject her to medical examination before insuring her. She was
twenty-eight years of age, but had never known personal abuse as a
slave; she was none the less anxious, however, to secure her freedom.
Her husband, Blue Beard, judging from certain signs, that he was
suspected by slave-holders, and might at any time be caged, (indeed he
had recently been in the lions' den, but got out); in order to save his
wife, sent her on in advance as he had decided to follow her soon in a
similar manner. Rebecca was not without hope of again meeting her
husband. This desire was gratified before many months had passed, as he
was fortunate enough to make his way to Canada.



Mary Knight was a single woman, twenty-six years of age, dark, stout,
and of pleasing manners; she complained of having been used hard.



Sarah Saunders had been claimed as the property of Richard Gatewood, a
clerk in the naval service. According to Sarah he was a very clever
slave-holder, and had never abused her. Nor was she aware that he had
ever treated any of his servants cruelly. Sarah, however, had not lived
in Gatewood's immediate family, but had been allowed to remain with her
grandmother, rather as a privileged character. She was young, fair, and
prepossessing. Having a sister living in Philadelphia, who was known to
the agent in Norfolk, Sarah was asked one day if she would not like to
see her sister. She at once answered "Yes." After further conversation
the agent told her that if she would keep the matter entirely private,
he would arrange for her to go by the Underground Rail Road. Being
willing and anxious to go, she promised due obedience to the rules; she
was not told, however, how much she would have to pass through on the
way, else, according to her own admission, she never would have come as
she did; her heart would have failed her. But when the goal was gained,
like all others, she soon forgot her sufferings, and rejoiced heartily
at getting out of Slavery, even though her condition had not been so bad
as that of many others.



Sophia Gray, with her son and daughter, Henry and Mary, was from
Portsmouth. The mother was a tall, yellow woman, with well cut features,
about thirty-three years of age, with manners indicative of more than
ordinary intelligence. The son and daughter were between twelve and
fourteen years of age; well-developed for their age, modest, and
finely-formed mulattoes. All the material necessary for a story of great
interest, might have readily been found in the story of the mother and
her children. They were sent with others to New Bedford, Massachusetts.
It was not long after being in New Bedford, before the boy was put to a
trade, and the daughter was sent to Boston, where she had an aunt (a
fugitive), living in the family of the Hon. George S. Hilliard. Mr. and
Mrs. Hilliard were so impressed by Mary's intelligent countenance and
her appearance generally, that they decided that she must have a chance
for an education, and opened their hearts and home to her.

On a visit to Boston, in 1859, the writer found Mary at Mr. Hilliard's,
and in an article written for the "Anti-Slavery Standard," upon the
condition of fugitive slaves in Boston and New Bedford, allusion was
made particularly to her and several others, under this hospitable roof,
in the following paragraph:

"On arriving in Boston, the first persons I had the pleasure to converse
with, were four or five uncommonly interesting Underground Rail Road
passengers, who had only been out of bondage between three and five
years. Their intelligent appearance contradicted the idea that they had
ever been an hour in Slavery, or a mile on an Underground Rail Road. Two
of them were filling trustworthy posts, where they were respected and
well paid for their services. Two others were young people (one two, and
the other three years out of Slavery), a girl of fifteen, and a boy of
twelve, whose interesting appearance induced a noble-hearted
Anti-Slavery lady to receive them into her own family, expressly to
educate them; and thus, almost ever since their arrival, they have been
enjoying this lady's kindness, as well as the excellent equal Free
School privileges of Boston. The girl, in the Grammar School (chiefly
composed of whites), has already distinguished herself, having received
a diploma, with an excellent certificate of character; and the boy,
naturally very apt, has made astonishing progress."



The "boy of twelve," alluded to, was not Mary's brother. He was quite a
genius of his age, who had escaped from Norfolk, stowed away in a
schooner and was known by the name of "Dick Page."

On arriving in Philadelphia, Dick was delivered, as usual, into the
hands of the Committee. The extraordinary smartness of the little fellow
(only ten years old), astonished all who saw him. The sympathies of a
kind-hearted gentleman and his wife, living in Philadelphia, had been
deeply awakened in his behalf, through their relative and friend, Mrs.
Hilliard, in whose family, as has been already stated, the boy's aunt
lived. So much were these friends interested to secure Dick's freedom,
that they often contemplated buying him, although they did not like the
idea of buying, as the money would go into the pocket of the master, who
they considered had no just right to deprive any individual of his
freedom. So when Dick arrived the Committee felt that it was as little
as they could do, to give these friends the pleasure of seeing the
little Underground Rail Road passenger. He was therefore conveyed to the
residence of Prof. J.P. Lesley. He could not have been sent to a house
in the great city of Brotherly Love, where he would have found a more
cordial and sincere reception. After passing an hour or so with them,
Dick was brought away, but he had been so touched by their kindness,
that he felt that he must see them again, before leaving the city; so
just before sundown, one evening, he was missed; search was made for
him, but in vain. Great anxiety was felt for him, fearing that he was
lost. During the early part of the evening, the writer, with a bell in
hand, passed up one street and down another, in quest of the stranger,
but no one could give any information of him. Finally about ten o'clock,
the mayor's office was visited with a view of having the police stations
telegraphed. Soon the mystery was solved; one of the policemen stated
that he had noticed a strange colored boy with Professor Lesley's
children. Hastening to the residence of the professor, sure enough, Dick
was there, happy in bed and asleep.

From that time to this, it has been a mystery to know how a boy, a
perfect stranger, could make his way alone, (having passed over the
route but once), without getting lost, so circuitous was the road that
he had to travel, in order to reach Professor Lesley's house. Having
said this much, the way is now open to refer to him again, in Boston at
school. He was generously assisted through his education and trade, and
was prepared to commence life at his majority, an intelligent mechanic,
and a man of promise.



THE CASE OF EUPHEMIA WILLIAMS,


CLAIMED AS A FUGITIVE SLAVE UNDER THE FUGITIVE SLAVE-LAW AFTER HAVING
LIVED IN PENNSYLVANIA FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS.


Scarcely had the infamous statute been in existence six months, ere the
worst predictions of the friends of the slave were fulfilled in
different Northern States. It is hardly too much to say, that
Pennsylvania was considered wholly unsafe to nine-tenths of her colored
population. The kidnapper is fully shown in the case of Rachel and
Elizabeth Parker as he appeared on the soil of Pennsylvania, doing his
vile work in the dead of night, entering the homes of unprotected
females and children, therefore:

The case of Euphemia Williams will serve to represent the milder form of
kidnapping in open day, in the name of the law, by professed Christians
in the city of Brotherly Love, and the home of William Penn.

February 6, 1851, Euphemia Williams, the mother of six children, the
youngest at the breast, was arrested in the upper part of the city
(Philadelphia), and hurried before Edward D. Ingraham, a United States
commissioner, upon the charge of being a fugitive from labor. She was
claimed by William T.J. Purnell, of Worcester county, Maryland, who
admitted that she had been away from him for twenty-two years, or since
1829. Her offspring were born on the soil of Pennsylvania, and the
eldest daughter was seventeen years of age.

Euphemia was living in her own house, and had been a member of church,
in good and regular standing, for about seventeen years, and was about
forty years of age. When the arrest was made, Euphemia had just risen
from her bed, and was only partly dressed, when a little after daylight,
several persons entered her room, and arrested her. Murder! murder! was
cried lustily, and awakened the house. Her children screamed lamentably,
and her eldest daughter cried "They've got my mother! they've got my
mother!" "For God's sake, save me," cried Euphemia, to a woman in the
second story, who was an eye-witness to this monstrous outrage. But
despite the piteous appeals of the mother and children, the poor woman
was hastened into a cab, and borne to the marshall's office.

Through the vigilance of J.M. McKim and Passmore Williamson, a writ of
habeas corpus returnable forthwith was obtained at about one o'clock.
The heart-broken mother was surrounded by five of her children, three of
whom were infants. It was a dark and dreadful hour. When her children
were brought into the room where she was detained, great drops of sweat
standing on her face plainly indicated her agony.

By mutual arrangement between the claimants and the prisoner's counsel
the hearing was fixed for the next day, at the hour of three o'clock.
According to said arrangement, at three o'clock Euphemia was brought
face to face with her claimant, William T.J. Purnell. The news had
already gone out that the trial would come off at the time fixed; hence
a multitude were on hand to witness the proceedings in the case. The
sympathy of anti-slavery ladies was excited, and many were present in
the court-room to manifest their feelings in behalf of the stricken
woman. The eloquent David Paul Brown (the terror of slave-hunters) and
William S. Pierce, Esqrs., appeared for Euphemia, R.C. McMurtrie, Esq.,
for the claimant.

Mr. McMurtrie in the outset, arose and said, that it was with extreme
regret that he saw an attempt to influence the decision of this case by
tumult and agitation. The sympathy shown by so many friendly ladies, was
not a favorable sign for the slave-holder. Notwithstanding, Mr.
McMurtrie said that he would "prove that Mahala, sometimes called Mahala
Purnell, was born and bred a slave of Dr. George W. Purnell, of
Worcester county, Maryland, who was in the habit of hiring her to the
neighbors, and while under a contract of hiring, she escaped with a boy,
with whom she had taken up, belonging to the person who hired her." The
present claimant claimed her as the administrator of Dr. George W.
Purnell.

In order to sustain this claim many witnesses and much positive swearing
were called forth. Robert F. Bowen, the first witness, swore that he
knew both Mahala and her master perfectly well, that he had worked as a
carpenter in helping to build a house for the latter, and also had hired
the former directly from her owner.

Definite time and circumstances were all harmoniously fixed by this
leading witness. One of the important circumstances which afforded him
ground for being positive was, as he testified on cross-examination,
that he was from home at a camp-meeting (when she run away); "our
camp-meetings," said the witness, "are held in the last of August or the
first of September; the year I fix by founding it upon knowledge; the
year before she ran away, I professed religion; I have something at home
to fix the year; she was with me a part of a year. I hired her for the
year 1848 as a house servant; I hired her directly from Dr. George W.
Purnell. When she ran away I proceeded after her. I advertised, in
Delaware in written advertisements, in Georgetown, Milford and
Millsborough, and described her and the boy; her general features. I
have not the advertisement and can't tell how she was described; Dr.
George Purnell united with me in the advertisement. I followed her to
Delaware City; that's all I have done since, about inquiring after them.
I came, after twenty-two years' absence, to seek my own rights, and as
an evidence for my friend. I have not seen her more than once since she
ran away, until she was arrested; I saw her two or three times in court.
I saw her first in a wretched-looking room, at Fifth and Germantown
Road; it was yesterday morning; it was the evening before at Congress
Hall; I arrived here last Tuesday a week; a man told me where she
was"--"I beg the court,"--here Mr. McMurtrie interposed an objection to
his mentioning the person. The court, however, said the question could
be put.

_Witness_.--I was pledged not to tell the name; the person signed her
name Louisa Truit; the information was got by letter; the reason I did
not tell, because I thought she might be murdered; I have not the
letters, and can't tell the contents; the letter that I received
required a pledge that I would not tell: I was directed to send my
letter to the post-office without any definite place; the representative
of Louisa Truit was a man; I saw him in Market street between Third and
Fourth, at Taylor and Paulding's store, in the course of last week; I
was brought into contact with the representative of Louisa by
appointment in the letter, to get the information; I never heard him
tell his name; he was neither colored nor white; we call them with us
mixed blood; (I should take you to be colored, said the witness to Mr.
Brown.) I suppose he lives somewhere up there; I saw him at my room the
next morning; I did not learn from him who wrote the letter; he did not
describe the person of the woman in the letter written to me, only her
general appearance; Purnell said he burnt the letter.

Mr. Brown demanded the letter, or the proof of its destruction.

I never wrote myself, but my friend, Mr. Henry did; he said so; I never
received a letter; it was written to Robert J. Henry; part of the letter
was written to me, but not directed to me; the Louisa Truit, who wrote,
stated, that for the information he wanted $100 for one of the
fugitives; he was referred to the store of Taylor & Paulding, and Mr.
Henry would meet him there; when I got to the store, some of the concern
let Mr. Henry know that a man wanted to see him; I heard this at the
store; the man was there; he was a mulatto man, middle-aged, and
middling tall; he is not here, that I know of; can't tell when I last
saw him. His name I understood to be Gloucester.

Under the severe cross-examination that the witness had been subjected
to under D.P. Brown, he became very faint, and called for water. Large
drops of sweat stood upon his forehead, and he was obliged to sit down,
lest he should fall down. "Take a seat," said Mr. Brown tauntingly, "and
enjoy yourself, while I proceed with my interrogations." But the witness
was completely used up, and was allowed to withdraw to another room,
where fresh air was more plentiful. The cause of the poor slave woman
was greatly strengthened by this failure.

Another witness, named Zachariah Bowen, for the claimants, swore
positively that he knew the prisoner well, that she had been hired to
his brother for three years by Dr. Purnell, whose slave she was; also he
swore that he knew her parents, who were slaves to the said Doctor P.;
that he last saw her in 1827, etc. On cross-examination he swore thus:
"I last saw her in 1827, she was about sixteen or seventeen; she was
about an ordinary size, not the smallest size, nor the largest; she was
neither thick nor thin; there was nothing remarkable in her more than is
common; nothing in her speech; she was about the same color as the woman
here; I never saw a great deal of change in a nigger, from sixteen to
thirty-five or forty, sometimes they grow fatter, and sometimes leaner.
As to recognizing her in Philadelphia, he had not the slightest
difficulty. He went on to swear, that he first saw her in a cab, in the
city; I knew her yesterday; if you could see the rest of the family you
could pick her out yourself in thirty: I knew her by her general favor,
and have no particular mark; I would not attempt to describe features;
her favor is familiar to me; I never saw any marks upon her."

Here Mr. Brown said he would not examine this witness further until he
had concluded the examination of the witness, who had become sick. The
court then adjourned till nine o'clock the next morning.

The avenues to the court were filled with anxious persons, and in the
front and rear of the state house the crowd was very great.

The next morning, at an early hour, the court-room, and all the avenues
to it were densely crowded by people interested in behalf of the woman
whose case was under trial. A large number of respectable ladies formed
a part of the large gathering.

Robert F. Bowen, the witness, who became sick, was recalled.

_Witness_.--"I saw the colored person, who gave the information, the
next evening; after I saw him in Market street, at Congress Hall, in our
room; the gentleman who keeps the hotel we did not wish to place under
any responsibility, as he might be accused of carrying on the business.
(Of kidnapping, suggested Mr. Brown.) No, said witness, that is what you
call it; the woman would have run away if it had gone out; I heard his
name was Gloucester, that gave the information; I saw him three times;
once on the street; I have never been in his house; I have been to a
house where I heard he lived; I gave a pledge not to disclose the
matter; I made a personal pledge to Gloucester in our room last week at
Congress Hall; he said he was afraid of being abused by the population
of his own color for telling that this girl run away from Dr. Purnell; I
understood that Louisa Truit was Gloucester's wife."

Under this searching cross-examination, Mr. Brown constrained him not
only to tell all and more than he knew in favor of his friend, the
claimant, but wrung from him the secrets which he stood pledged never to
disclose.

_Witness_.--"I know no marks; she was in the condition of a married
woman when she left me; it was the particular favor of her father and
mother that made me recognize her; nothing else; she was pretty well
built for her size."

While this witness remembered every thing so accurately occurring in
relation to the life and escape of the girl of sixteen, and was prepared
to swear to her identity simply "by her favor," as he termed it, he was
found sadly deficient in memory touching the owner, whom he had known
much longer, and more intimately than he had the girl, as will be seen
from the following facts in this witness' testimony:

_Witness_.--"I don't know when Dr. P. died; I can't tell the year; I
should suppose about fourteen years ago; I was at the funeral, and
helped to make his coffin; it was in the fall, I think; it was after the
camp-meeting I spoke of; at that time I went regularly, but not of late;
I have no certain recollection of the year he died; I kept a record of
the event of my conversion, and have referred to it often. It has been a
reference every year, and perhaps a thousand times a year; it was in the
Bible, and I was in the habit of looking into it; I was in the habit of
turning over the leaves of this precious book; I think it was eighteen
years ago; can't say I'm certain; can't say it was more than twelve
years; Dr. P. left six children; two remain in our country, and one in
Louisiana, and the one, who is here, making four; I have no interest in
the fugitive; I made no contract in regard to this case; there was an
offer; are you waiting for an answer? the offer was this, that I was to
come on after my fugitive, and if I did not get him they were to pay my
expenses; I hesitated about coming; it was a long time before I made up
my mind; they said they would pay my expenses if I didn't succeed in
getting mine out of prison."

In this way the above witness completely darkened counsel, and added to
the weakness of his cause in a marked degree.



THE OVERSEER IS NOW EXAMINED.


_Zachariah Bowen_ recalled.--"I didn't come here on any terms; I hardly
understand what you mean by terms; I made no contract; I came upon my
own book; there was no contract; I have no expectations; I don't know
that Dr. P. ever manumitted any female slaves; I never knew that she was
in the family way when she ran away; I heard of it about that time; she
ran off in the fall of 1828. Dr. P. told me so; in the fall of 1828; in
1825, '26, '27, she lived with my brother; in 1825 I lived there; in
1827 and '28 I lived with Dr. P. I moved there and was overseer for him;
I was overseer for fifteen years for him; two years at his house; I
ceased to be his overseer in 1841, I think; he was living in 1841; I am
certain of that year, I think; Dr. Purnell died in 1844, I feel certain;
I said to Mr. Purnell that I did not know what ailed the other Mr.
Bowen, for the doctor died in 1844; he died in the latter part of the
Spring of 1844; Mr. Bowen made a mistake in saying it was eighteen years
ago; if you recall him he will rectify the mistake, I think; several
slaves escaped from Dr. Purnell; a boy, that lived with my brother, ran
away in 1827; the others were not hired to my brother; I don't know that
I could tell the exact time, nor the year; the doctor used to say to us,
there is another of my niggers ran away; the reason that I can tell when
Mahala ran away, is because she took a husband and ran away; I was
married that year; the reason I cannot tell about the others is, because
they went at different times in five years; the first who ran away
before Mahala, was named Grace; she went in 1827; I don't know when the
last went, or who it was."


       *       *       *       *       *


Gloucester said they had raised a mob on him, on account of this case,
and he would have to leave the city; the case of this woman or these
proceedings was not spoken of there; he staid but a short time; he said
one of the witnesses had betrayed him in court, yesterday, and they
attacked him last night; I asked him how he escaped from so many; he
said very few were in the city who could outrun him; I asked him where
he was going, he replied he had a notion to put for Canada; some of the
gentlemen proposed his going to Baltimore; he said that would not do, as
the laws of Maryland would catch him; he was going to get a boat and go
to New Jersey, and then to New York; Mr. Purnell gave him just
thirty-five dollars last night; he paused a while, and Mr. P. told him
to hand it back; he then took out his money and put some more to it, and
said: "Here is fifty dollars." Mr. P. said that if he got the slave he
would leave fifty dollars more with a person in the city.


       *       *       *       *       *


Question by the judge.--"You have spoken of a conversation in which Mr.
P. told you of certain letters or correspondence, and that they had
reference to this alleged fugitive. I want you to give me, to the best
of your recollection, everything he said the letters contained."

_Witness_.--Mr. P. told me when he first mentioned it to me, he said
that he was going to mention something to me, that he did not want
anything said, in regard to some negroes that had run away from his
father; he said he wanted me to come on here, and he did not want me to
tell any person before we left our county; that if the negroes heard of
it, they could get information to the parties before he could get here;
I told him I would not tell any person except my wife; he then said he
had correspondence with a person here, for a month or two, and he had no
doubt but that several of his negroes were here, from what he had heard
from his correspondent; he asked me if I could recognize the favor of
this Mahala? I told him I didn't know; he then said if anybody would
know her, I would, as she had lived with my brother three years; he then
said that he would want to start the next week, but he would see me
again at that time; that was all he said at that time, only we turned
into a hotel, and he said don't breathe this to anybody; on Saturday
before we left home, he came to my house, and said: well, I shall want
you to start for Philadelphia, on Monday morning; I suppose you will go?
I told him I would rather not, if he could do without out me; but as I
told him before, I would go, if he still requested it. I would go;
that's all, sir, except that I said I would be along in the stage.

J.T. Hammond was then called, a young man who admitted he had never seen
the respondent till he came to the court-house, but was ready to swear
that he would have known her by her resemblance to Dr. Purnell's set of
negroes. "His whole set?" said Mr. Brown. "Yes, sir." (Derisive
laughter).


       *       *       *       *       *


Mr. McMurtrie offered to prove, by persons who had known the two
witnesses who had testified in this case, from their youth, that they
were respectable and worthy men. D.P. Brown, said that if the gentleman
found it necessary to sustain his witnesses' reputation, in consequence
of the peculiar dilemma they had got into, he would object, and if he
supposed that he was about to contradict them in some point in the
defence, he certainly was right, but as the case could not be concluded
to-day, he would like to have the matter adjourned over until Tuesday
next.

Mr. McMurtrie objected, by saying, that his client was anxious to have
the matter disposed of as soon as possible, as he had been subjected to
numerous insults since the matter had been before the court.

Judge Kane intimated that no weight was to be attached to this
consideration, as the full power of the court was at his disposal for
the purpose of protecting his client from insult.

Mr. McMurtrie replied that he did not know whether words spoken came
within the meaning of the act of Congress, in such matters.

The court took a recess until a quarter to three o'clock.

The court met again at a quarter to three o'clock.

Mr. McMurtrie asked that the witnesses for the defence be excluded from
the court room, except the one upon the stand.

This was objected to by Mr. Brown, as the witnesses for the prosecution
had not been required so to do; but he afterwards withdrew his
objections, and notified Mr. McMurtrie that he would require any
witnesses he might have in addition, should retire also; as he would
object to any of them being heard if they remained.

_The Defence_.--Mr. Pierce opened the case by saying that the testimony
for the defence would be clear and conclusive; that the witnesses for
the prosecution are mistaken in the identity of the alleged fugitive.
That at the time they allege her to have been in Maryland, on the
plantation of Dr. Purnell, she was in Chester county, and in the year
Lafayette visited this country, she was in this city. He would confine
the testimony exclusively to these two counties, and show that she is
not the alleged slave.

Henry C. Cornish, sworn. I live in this city, and am a shoemaker; I came
here in the year 1830; before that I lived in Chester county, East
Whiteland township, with Wm. Latta; my father lived with Mr. Latta six
or eight years; I lived there three years before that time, and was
familiar with the place for more than six years before 1830; I saw the
alleged fugitive some five years before 1830, at George Amos', in
Uwchland township, some eight or ten miles from our house; I fix the
time from a meeting being held on the Valley Hill by a minister, named
Nathan D. Tierney; that must have been in 1825; I am positive it was
before the beginning of the year 1828; I have not the least doubt; I
joined church about that time; it was the first of my uniting with the
church; it was in 1825; I joined the Methodist Episcopal Church; before
they built a church they held meetings alternately at people's houses; I
met her at Amos' house, I recollect my father going to dig the
foundation of the church: I saw her there before the church was built; I
knew her before she was married; and since I left there I have met her
at the annual meetings of the church; I have kept up the acquaintance
ever since; I knew that she had two children, that were buried as long
as twenty-one or twenty-two years ago; if the boy had lived he would
have been twenty-three or twenty-four years old; he was the oldest; she
was not married when I first saw her in 1827; she did not appear to be
anything but a girl, and was not married, and she of course could not be
in the condition of a married woman; I was not at her wedding; if I had
not continued to know her, I would not now know her; she was then a
small person; age and flesh would change her a little; her complexion
has not changed; I think she worked for Mrs. Amos; a church record is
now kept very correct; but when I first went into the church, colored
men could not read and write; I acted as the clerk of the church; I
united with the church after I first saw her; I have seen her very often
since I left Chester; five hundred times to speak safely; I worship down
town and she up in Brown street; to the best of my recollection they
moved over Schuylkill about twelve years ago; she has lived here about
nine years; she has six children, I have heard; I have seen five; the
oldest is eighteen or nineteen; the youngest a sucking babe; I have
visited her house since I have been here; I was not sent for by my
uncle, who was employed by Joseph Smith & Co., next to the Girard Bank;
I was with Edward Biddle for four years, until he was elected President
of the Morris Canal and Banking Company, and then I went to learn
shoemaking under instructions, since which time I have been in business
for myself; my father burnt limestone for Mr. Latta; he and his wife are
dead; I was there a day or two ago for witnesses to testify in this
case.

_Cross-examined._--I was born in 1814, and am thirty-seven years of age;
when I first knew her I suppose she was fifteen years old; she was
married about three years afterwards; her husband's name is Micajah
Williams; I heard he was in prison for stealing; her name before
marriage was Phamie Coates; I didn't know her husband before they were
married; don't know whether they came from Maryland; I never knew of
Mahala Richardson before last evening in court; the difference in her
appearance is a natural one, that every body is acquainted with; I mean
that a little boy is not a man, and a growing girl is not a woman; age
and flesh and size make a difference; if I had not conversed with her
during the twenty-one years, I would not have known her; I never changed
a word with her about the case, except to say I was sorry to see her
here; I knew her the moment I saw her; her arrest could not have been in
the newspapers of the morning as she was not arrested until seven
o'clock that day; I went to Chester to look for witnesses; I came to the
court because I am a vigilant man, and my principle is to save any
person whose liberty is in danger; I had heard that a woman was
arrested; her business is to get work wherever she can.

Deborah Ann Boyer, sworn. I was thirty-three last January; I live within
one mile of West Chester; I am a married woman; I have lived there since
1835. I went there with my mother; I can read; I have seen the alleged
fugitive before this; I first knew her at Downingtown, when she came to
my mother's house; that was before I had gone to West Chester with my
mother; you can tell how long it was, for it was in 1826; my brother was
born in that year; I was quite small then; don't know how she came
there; she was with my mother during her confinement; my brother is
dead; it is written down in our Testament; and I took an epitaph from it
to put on the tombstone; the last time I saw it was when the fellow
killed the school-mistress. I looked because about 1830, a man killed a
woman, and was hung, and I wanted to see how long ago it was. I have
seen her more or less ever since, until within two years. I don't
remember when she went from mother, but I saw her at Mr. Latta's
afterwards. I have no doubt she is the woman; she was then a slim, tall
girl, larger than myself; she is not darker now, but heavier set every
way.


       *       *       *       *       *


Sarah Gayly affirmed.--I am between forty-seven and forty-eight years of
age. I live in the city at this time. I was raised in Chester county, in
1824, and have been here about five years. I lived in Downingtown nine
or ten years. I lived awhile in West Chester, and lived in Chester
county until about five years ago. I know the alleged fugitive. I first
saw her in the neighborhood of Downingtown, at a place they call
Downing's old stage office; she worked in the house with me; it was
somewhere near 1824, just before Lafayette came about; she worked off
and on days' work, to wash dishes; she was a small girl then, very thin,
and younger than me. I met with her, as near as I can tell you, down in
the valley, at a place called the Valley Inn. I used to see her off and
on at church, in 1826. I visited her at Mr. Latta's, after she lived at
the Valley Inn. I don't know when she left that county. I know the
alleged fugitive is the same person; she belonged to the same church,
Ebenezer. I know the brothers Cornish, and have whipped them many a
time. I lived with Latta myself, and the Cornish, who is now a minister,
lived there; he lived there before I did, and so did the alleged
fugitive. I was then between twenty-three and twenty-five years old; she
was a strip of a girl; she was not in the family way when she came
there.

Cross-examined.--I have not seen her since 1826, until I saw her here in
the court-room; I recognized her when I first saw her here without
anybody pointing her out, and she recognized me; I have reason to know
her, because she has the same sort of a scar on her forehead that I
have; we used to make fun of each other about the marks; she went by the
name of Fanny Coates. I know nothing about her husband; she did not do
the work of a woman in 1826; she washed dishes, scrubbed, etc. I heard
her say her father and mother were dead, and that they lived somewhere
in that neighborhood; she at that time made her home with a family named
Amos.

The Judge asked to see the scar on the witness' forehead and that on the
forehead of the respondent. They were brought near the bench, and the
marks inspected, which were plainly seen on both. During this time the
infant of the respondent was entrusted to another colored woman. The
child, who, up to this time, had been quiet, raised a piteous cry and
would not be pacified. The whole scene excited a great sensation.


       *       *       *       *       *


Mr. Brown then rose in reply to the plaintiff's counsel, and said: If I
consulted my own views, I should not say one syllable, in answer to the
arguments of the learned counsel upon the other side, and relying as I
do upon the evidence, and out of respect to the convenience of your
honor, I shall say very little as it is. The views of the counsel it
appears to me, are most extraordinary indeed. He seems to take it for
granted that everything that is said on the part of the witnesses for
the claimant is gospel, and that what is said on the part of the
witnesses for the respondent, is to be considered matter of suspicion.
Now I rate no man by his size, color, or position, but I appeal to you
in looking at the testimony that has been produced here, on the
different sides of the question, and judging it by its intrinsic worth,
whether there is the slightest possible comparison between the witnesses
on the part of the plaintiff, and those of the defendant, either in
intelligence, memory, language, thought, or anything else. This is a
fine commentary upon the disparagement of color! Looking at the men as
they are, as you will, I say that the testimony exhibited on the part of
the respondent would outweigh a whole theatre of such men as are
exhibited on the part of the complainant. I say nothing here about their
respectability. It would have been proper for the learned counsel on the
part of the plaintiff, if he thought the witnesses on the part of the
respondent unworthy of belief, to have proved them so; but instead of
that, he attempts to bolster up men, who, whether respectable or
otherwise, from their inconsistency, involutions and tergiversations in
regard to this case, produce no possible effect upon the judicial mind,
but that which is unfavorable to themselves. Impartial men, are they?
How do they appear before you? They appear under cover from first to
last; standing upon their right to resist inquiries legitimately
propounded to them; burning up letters since they have arrived,
calculated to shed light upon this subject; and before they come here,
corresponding with and deriving information from a man, an evident
kidnapper, who dare not sign his name and gets his wife to sign hers.
This is the character these men exhibit here before you; clandestinely
meeting together at the tavern, and that to consult in regard to the
identity of a person about whom they know nothing. Can they refer to any
marks by which to identify this person? Nothing at all of the kind. Do
they, with the exception of the first witness examined, state even the
time when she left? Have they produced the letter written by this
kidnapper, showing how he described her? Why, let me ask, is not the
full light allowed to shine on this case? But even with the light they
have shed upon it, I would have been perfectly content to have rested
it, relying upon their testimony alone, for a just decision.


       *       *       *       *       *


Now, what man among them, professes to have seen this woman for
twenty-one years? Not one. The learned gentleman attempts to sustain his
case, because one of our witnesses, certainly not more than one, has not
seen this woman for about the same length of time: but don't you
perceive, that in this case they all lived in the same State, if not in
the same county--they had intercourse with persons mutually acquainted
with her, and three out of four of them, met her for several months at
the same church; and one witness, who had long been in her society, and
in close association with her, knew she had a mark upon her forehead
corresponding to the one she bore on her own. And by dint of all these
matters, this long continued acquaintance only reviving the impressions
received in early life, they had no doubt of the identity of the person.
Was there ever a more perfect train of evidence exhibited to prove the
identity of a person, than on the present occasion?


       *       *       *       *       *


We have called witnesses on this point alone, and have more than
counterpoised the evidence produced upon the opposite side. And we have
not only made it manifest that she was a free woman, but we have
confirmed her charter by separate proof. What does the gentleman say
further? Do I understand him to say we have no right to determine this
matter judicially? Now what is all this about? Why is it before you,
taking your time day after day? According to this argument, you have
nothing to do but to give the master the flesh he claims. But you are to
be satisfied that you have sufficient reason to believe that these
claims are well founded. And if you leave that matter in a state of
doubt, it does not require a single witness to be called on the part of
the respondent, to prove on the opposite side of the question. But we
have come in with a weight of evidence demolishing the structure he has
raised, restoring the woman to her original position in the estimation
of the law. "Well," says the gentleman, "it is like the case of a
fugitive from justice." But it is not, and if it were, it would not
benefit his case. The case of a fugitive from justice is one in which
the prisoner is remanded to the custody of the law, handed over for
legal purposes. The case of a fugitive from labor is a case in which the
individual is handed over sometimes to a merciless master, and very
rarely to a charitable one. Does the counsel mean to say that in the
case of a fugitive from justice he is not bound to satisfy the judge
before whom, the question is heard? He should prove our witnesses
unworthy of belief. As Judge Grier said, upon a former occasion, "You
can choose your own time; you have full and abundant opportunities on
every side to prepare against any contingency." Why don't they do so? He
is not to come here and force on a case, and say, I suppose you take
every thing for granted. He is to come prepared to prove the justice of
his claim before the tribunal who is to decide upon it. That he has not
done successfully, and I would, therefore, ask your Honor, after the
elaborate argument on the part of the plaintiff, to discharge this
woman: for after such an abundance of testimony unbroken and
incontestable as that we have exhibited here, it would be a monstrous
perversion of reason to suppose that anything more could be required.

Mr. McMurtrie replied by reasserting his positions. It was a grave
question for the court to consider what evidence was required. He
thought that this decision might be the turning case to show whether the
act of Congress would be carried out or whether we were to return in
fact to the state of affairs under the old laws.

Judge Kane said, in reference to the remarks at the close of Mr.
McMurtrie's speech: So long as I retain my seat on this bench, I shall
endeavor to enforce this law without reference to my own sympathies, or
the sympathies and opinions of others. I do not think, in the cases
under this act of Congress, or a treaty, or constitutional, or legal
provision for the extradition of fugitives from justice, that it is
possible to imagine that conclusive proof of identity could be
established by depositions. From the nature of the case and the facts to
be proved, proof cannot be made in anticipation of the identity of the
party. That being established, it is the office of the judge, to
determine whether a _prima facie_ case indicates the identity of the
party charged, with the party before him.


       *       *       *       *       *


On the other hand, the evidence of the claimant has been met, and
regarding the bearing of the witnesses for the respondent, met by
witnesses who testified, with apparent candor and great intelligence. If
they are believed, then the witnesses for the claimant are mistaken. The
question is, whether two witnesses for the claimant, who have not seen
the respondent for twenty-three, one for twenty-four years, are to be
believed in preference to four witnesses on the other side, three of
whom have seen her frequently since 1826, and known her as Euphemia
Williams, and the fourth, who has not seen her for a quarter of a
century, but testifies that when they were children, they used to jest
each other about scars, which they still bear upon their persons; I am
bound to say that the proof by the four witnesses has not been
overthrown by the contrary evidence of the two who only recognized her
when they called on her with the marshall. One says he called her Mahala
Purnell as soon as he saw her. He might be mistaken. He inferred he
would find her at the place to which he went. There were three persons
in the room, one was Mahala Richardson, whom he knew, a young girl, and
the prisoner. If she had been alone, his recognition would have been of
no avail. The fact is obvious to this court, that the respondent has no
peculiar physiognomy or gait. It has been shown she has no peculiarity
of voice; I cannot but feel that the fact alleged by the claimant is
very doubtful, when the witnesses, without mark or peculiarity, testify
that they can readily recognize the girl of fifteen in the woman of
forty. The prisoner is therefore discharged.

A slight attempt at applause in the court room was promptly suppressed.
The intelligence of the discharge of the woman, was quickly spread to
those without, who raised shouts of joy. The woman, with her children,
were hurried into a carriage, which was driven first to the Anti-slavery
office and then to the Philadelphia Institute, in Lombard Street above
Seventh. Here she was introduced to a large audience of colored people,
who hailed her appearance with lively joy; several excited speeches were
made, and great enthusiasm was manifested in and outside of the building
and the adjacent streets. When Euphemia came out, the horses were taken
out of the carriage, and a long rope was attached, which was taken by as
many colored people as could get hold of it, and the woman and her
children thus conveyed to her home.

The procession was accompanied by several hundreds of men, women and
boys. They dragged the carriage past the residence of the counsel for
the respondent, cheering them by huzzas of the wildest kind, and then
took the vehicle and its contents to the residence of the woman,
Germantown Road near Fifth street, beguiling the way with songs and
shouts. The whole scene was one of wild, ungovernable excitement,
produced by exuberance of joy.

The masterly management of abolitionists in connection with the counsel,
saved poor Euphemia from being dragged from her children into hopeless
bondage. While the victory was a source of great momentary rejoicing on
the part of the friends of the slave it was nevertheless quite manifest
that she was only released by the "skin of her teeth." "A scar on her
forehead" saved her. Relative to this important mark, a few of
Euphemia's friends enjoyed a very pleasing anecdote, which, at the time,
they were obliged to withhold from the public; it is too good to be kept
any longer. For a time, Euphemia was kept in durance vile, up in the
dome of Independence Hall, partly in the custody of Lieutenant Gouldy of
the Mayor's police, (who was the right man in the right place), whose
sympathies were secretly on the side of the slave. While his pitying
eyes gazed on Euphemia's sad face, he observed a very large scar on her
forehead, and was immediately struck with the idea that that old scar
might be used with damaging effect by the witnesses and counsel against
her. At once he decided that the scar must be concealed, at least, until
after the examination of the claimant's witnesses. Accordingly a large
turban was procured and placed on Euphemia's head in such a manner as to
hide the scar completely, without exciting the least suspicion in the
minds of any. So when the witnesses against her swore that she had no
particular mark, David Paul Brown made them clinch this part of their
testimony irrevocably. Now, when Sarah Gayly affirmed (on the part of
the prisoner) that "I have reason to know her because she has the same
sort of a scar on her forehead that I have, we used to make fun of each
other about the marks," etc., if it was not evident to all, it was to
some, that she had "stolen their thunder," as the "chop-fallen"
countenances of the slave-holder's witnesses indicated in a moment.
Despair was depicted on all faces sympathizing with the pursuers.

With heavy pecuniary losses, sad damage of character, and comfortless,
the unhappy claimant and his witnesses were compelled to return to
Maryland, wiser if not better men. The account of this interesting
trial, we have condensed from a very careful and elaborate report of it
published in the "Pennsylvania Freeman," January 13th, 1857.

Apparently, the vigilance of slave-hunters was not slackened by this
defeat, as the records show that many exciting cases took place in
Philadelphia and Pennsylvania, and if the records of the old
Abolitionist Society could be published, as they should be, it would
appear that many hard-fought battles have taken place between Freedom
and Slavery on this soil.

Here in conclusion touching the Fugitive Slave Law, arrests under it,
etc., as a fitting sequel we copy two extracts from high authority. The
first is from the able and graphic pen of James Miller McKim, who was
well known to stand in the front ranks of both the Anti-slavery Society
and the Underground Rail Road cause through all the long and trying
contest, during which the country was agitated by the question of
immediate emancipation, and shared the full confidence and respect of
Abolitionists of all classes throughout the United States and Great
Britain.

The letter from which we have made this extract was written to Hon.
George Thompson, the distinguished abolitionist of England, and speaks
for itself. The other quotation is from the pen of a highly respectable
and intelligent lady, belonging to the Society of Friends, or Quakers,
and a most devoted friend of the slave, whose statement obviously is
literally true.

From Mr. McKiM to GEORGE THOMPSON, 1851.


    The accompanying parcel of extracts will give you a full account
    of the different slave cases tried in this city, under the new
    Fugitive Slave Law up to this time. Full and accurate as these
    reports are, they will afford you but a faint idea of the
    anguish and confusion that have been produced in this part of
    the country by this infamous statute. It has turned Southeastern
    Pennsylvania into another Guinea Coast, and caused a large
    portion of the inhabitants to feel as insecure from the brutal
    violence and diabolical acts of the kidnapper, as are the
    unhappy creatures who people the shores of Africa. Ruffians from
    the other side of the Slave-line, aided by professional
    kidnappers on our own soil, a class of men whose 'occupation'
    until lately, had been 'gone,' are continually prowling through
    the community, and every now and then seizing and carrying away
    their prey. As a specimen of the boldness, though fortunately,
    not of the success always with which these wretches prosecute
    their nefarious trade, read the enclosed article, which I cut
    from the _Freeman_, of January 2d, and bear in mind that in no
    respect are the facts here mentioned over-stated.

    This affair occurred in Chester county, one of the most orderly
    and intelligent counties in the State, a county settled
    principally by Quakers. A week or two after this occurrence, and
    not far from the same place, a farmhouse was entered by a band
    of armed ruffians, in the evening, and at a time when all the
    able-bodied occupants, save one, were known to be absent. This
    was a colored man, who was seated by the kitchen fire, and in
    the act of taking off his shoes. He was instantly knocked down
    and gagged; but, still resisting, he was beaten most
    unmercifully. There was a woman, and also a feeble old man, in
    the house, who were attracted to the spot by the scuffle; but
    they could neither render any assistance, nor (the light being
    put out), could they recognize the parties engaged in it. The
    unhappy victim being fairly overcome, was dragged like a slain
    beast to a wagon, which was about a hundred yards distant,
    waiting to receive him. In this he was placed, and conveyed
    across the line, which was about twenty miles further south; and
    that was the last, so far as I know, that has ever been heard of
    him. The alarm was given, of course, as soon as possible, and
    the neighbors were quickly in pursuit; but the kidnappers had
    got the start of them. The next morning the trail between the
    house, and the place where the wagon stood, was distinctly
    visible, and deeply marked with blood.

    About a fortnight since, a letter was brought to our office,
    from a well-known friend, the contents of which were in
    substance as follows: A case of kidnapping had occurred in the
    vicinity of West Cain Township, Chester county, at about half
    past one on Sunday morning, the 16th March. A black man, by the
    name of Thomas Hall, an honest, sober, and industrious
    individual, living in the midst of a settlement of farmers, had
    been stolen by persons who knocked at his door, and told him
    that his nearest neighbor wanted him to come to his house, one
    of his children being sick. Hall, not immediately opening his
    door, it was burst in, and three men rushed into his house; Hall
    was felled by the bludgeons of the men. His wife received
    several severe blows, and on making for the door was told, that
    if she attempted to go out or halloo, she would have her brains
    blown out. She, however, escaped through a back window, and gave
    the alarm; but before any person arrived upon the ground, they
    had fled with their victim. He was taken without any clothing,
    except his night clothes. A six-barrelled revolver, heavily
    loaded, was dropped in the scuffle, and left; also a silk
    handkerchief, and some old advertisement of a bear bait, that
    was to take place in Emmittsburg, Maryland. In how many cases
    the persons stolen are legally liable to capture, it is
    impossible to state. The law, you know, authorizes arrests to be
    made, with or without process, and nothing is easier under such
    circumstances than to kidnap persons who are free born.

    The very same day that I received the above mentioned letter,
    and while our hearts were still aching over its contents,
    another was brought us from Thomas Garrett, of Wilmington,
    Delaware, announcing the abduction, a night or two before, of a
    free colored man of that city. The outrage was committed by an
    ex-policeman, who, pretending to be acting under the commission
    which he had been known to hold, entered, near the hour of
    midnight, the house of the victim, and alleging against him some
    petty act of disorder, seized him, handcuffed him in the
    presence of his dismayed family, and carried him off to
    Maryland. The cheat that had been practised was not discovered
    by the family until next evening; but it was too late, the man
    was gone.

    At the time Mr. Garrett's letter was handed to me, narrating the
    foregoing case of man stealing, I was listening to the sad tales
    of two colored women, who had come to the office for advice and
    assistance. One of them was an elderly person, whose son had
    been pursued by the marshal's deputies, and who had just escaped
    with 'the skin of his teeth.' She did not come on her own
    account, however; her heart was too full of joy for that. She
    came to accompany the young woman who was with her. This young
    woman was a remarkably intelligent, lady-like person, and her
    story made a strong appeal to my feelings. She is a resident of
    Washington, and her errand here was, to procure the liberation
    of a sister-in-law, who is confined in that city, under very
    peculiar circumstances. The sister-in-law had absconded from her
    mistress about nine months since, and was secreted in the room
    of an acquaintance, who was cook in a distinguished
    slave-holding family in Washington; her intention being, there
    to wait until all search should be over, and an opportunity
    offer of escape to the North. But, as yet, no such opportunity
    had presented itself; at least none that was available, and for
    nine long months had that poor girl been confined in the narrow
    limits of the cook's chamber, watched over day and night by that
    faithful friend with a vigilance as sleepless as it was
    disinterested. The time had now come, however, when something
    must be done. The family in whose house she is hid is about to
    be broken up, and the house to be vacated, and the girl must
    either be rescued from her peril, or she, and all her
    accomplices must be exposed. What to do under these
    circumstances was the question which brought this woman to
    Philadelphia. I advised her to the best of my ability, and sent
    her away hopeful, if not rejoicing.

    But in many of these cases we can render no aid whatever. All we
    can do is to commend them to the God of the oppressed, and labor
    on for the day of general deliverance. But, oh! the horrors of
    this hell-born system, and the havoc made by this; its last foul
    offspring, the Fugitive Slave law. The anguish, the terror, the
    agony inflicted by this infamous statute, must be witnessed to
    be fully appreciated. You must hear the tale of the
    broken-hearted mother, who has just received tidings that her
    son is in the hands of man-thieves. You must listen to the
    impassioned appeal of the wife, whose husband's retreat has been
    discovered, and whose footsteps are dogged by the blood-hounds
    of Slavery. You must hear the husband, as I did, a few weeks
    ago, himself bound and helpless, beg you for God's sake to save
    his wife. You must see such a woman as Hannah Dellam, with her
    noble-looking boy at her side, pleading in vain before a
    pro-slavery judge, that she is of right free; that her son is
    entitled to his freedom; and above all, that her babe, about to
    be born, should be permitted to open its eyes upon the light of
    liberty. You must hear the judge's decision, remorselessly
    giving up the woman with her children born and unborn, into the
    hands of their claimants--by them to be carried to the slave
    prison, and thence to be sold to a returnless distance from the
    remaining but scattered fragments of her once happy family.
    These things you must see and hear for yourself before you can
    form any adequate idea of the bitterness of this cup which the
    unhappy children of oppression along this southern border are
    called upon to drink. Manifestations like these have we been
    obliged either to witness ourselves, or hear the recital of from
    others, almost daily, for weeks together. Our aching hearts of
    late, have known but little respite. A shadow has been cast over
    our home circles, and a check been given to the wonted
    cheerfulness of our families. One night, the night that the
    woman and the boy and the unborn babe received their doom, my
    wife, long after midnight, literally wept herself to sleep. For
    the last fortnight we have had no new cases; but even now, when
    I go home in the evening, if I happen to look more serious than
    usual, my wife notices it, and asks: "Is there another slave
    case?" and my little girls look up anxiously for my reply.

From Miss MARY B. THOMAS.


Daring outrage! burglary and kidnapping! The following letter tells its
own startling and most painful story. Every manly and generous heart
must burn with indignation at the villainy it describes, and bleed with
sympathy for the almost broken-hearted sufferers.


    DOWNINGTOWN, 19th, 4th mo., 1848.

    "My Dear Friend:--This morning our family was aroused by the
    screams of a young colored girl, who has been living with us
    nearly a year past; but we were awakened only in time to see her
    borne off by three white men, ruffians indeed, to a carriage at
    our door, and in an instant she was on her way to the South. I
    feel so much excited by the attendant circumstances of this
    daring and atrocious deed, as scarcely to be able to give you a
    coherent account of it, but I know that it is a duty to make it
    known, and, I therefore write this immediately.

    "As soon as the house was opened in the morning, these men who
    were lurking without, having a carriage in waiting in the
    street, entered on their horrid errand. They encountered no one
    in their entrance, except a colored boy, who was making the
    fire; and who, being frightened at their approach, ran and hid
    himself; taking a lighted candle from the kitchen, and carrying
    it up stairs, they went directly to the chamber in which the
    poor girl lay in a sound sleep. They lifted her from her bed and
    carried her down stairs. In the entry of the second floor they
    met one of my sisters, who, hearing an unusual noise, had sprung
    from her bed. Her screams, and those of the poor girl, who was
    now thoroughly awakened to the dreadful truth, aroused my
    father, who hurried undressed from his chamber, on the ground
    floor. My father's efforts were powerless against the three;
    they threw him off, and with frightful imprecations hurried the
    girl to the carriage. Quickly as possible my father started in
    pursuit, and reached West Chester only to learn that the
    carriage had driven through the borough at full speed, about
    half an hour before. They had two horses to their vehicle, and
    there were three men besides those in the house. These
    particulars we gather from the colored boy Ned, who, from his
    hiding-place, was watching them in the road.

    "Can anything be done for the rescue of this girl from the
    kidnappers? We are surprised and alarmed! This deliberate
    invasion of our house, is a thing unimagined. There must be some
    informer, who is acquainted with our house and its arrangements,
    or they never would have come so boldly through. Truly, there is
    no need to preach about Slavery in the abstract, this individual
    case combines every wickedness by which human nature can be
    degraded.

    Truly, thy friend,

    MARY B. THOMAS."


In a subsequent letter, our friend says: "As to detail, the whole
transaction was like a flash to those who saw the miserable ending. I
was impelled to write without delay, by the thought that it would be in
time for the 'Freeman,' and that any procrastination on my part, might
jeopard others of these suffering people, who are living, as was this
poor girl, in fancied security. Our consternation was inexpressible; our
sorrow and indignation deepen daily, as the thought returns of the awful
announcement with which we were awakened: they have carried Martha to
the South. To do what will be of most service to the cause--not their
cause--ours--that of our race, is our burning desire."

HELPERS AND SYMPATHIZERS AT HOME AND ABROAD--INTERESTING LETTERS.


The necessities of the Committee for the relief of the destitute and
way-worn travelers bound freedom-ward, were met mainly by friends of the
cause in Philadelphia. Generous-hearted abolitionists nobly gave their
gold in this work. They gave not only material, but likewise
whole-souled aid and sympathy in times of need, to a degree well worthy
of commemoration while the name of slave is remembered. The Shipleys,
Hoppers, Parrishes, Motts, Whites, Copes, Wistars, Pennocks, Sellers,
Davis, Prices, Hallowells, Sharpless, Williams, Coates, Morris, Browns,
Townsends, Taylors, Jones, Grews, Wises, Lindseys, Barkers, Earles,
Pughs, Rogers, Whartons, Barnes, Willsons, Wrights, Peirces, Justices,
Smiths, Cavenders, Stackhouses, Nealls, Dawsons, Evans, Lees, Childs,
Clothiers, Harveys, Laings, Middletons, etc., are among the names
well-known in the days which tried men's souls, as being most true to
the bondman, whether on the Underground Rail Road, before a Fugitive
Slave-Law Court, or on a rice or cotton plantation in the South. Nor
would we pass over the indefatigable labors of the Ladies' Anti-slavery
Societies and Sewing Circles of Philadelphia, whose surpassing fidelity
to the slave in the face of prejudice, calumny and reproach, year in and
year out, should be held in lasting remembrance. In the hours of
darkness they cheered the cause. While we thus honor the home-guards and
coadjutors in our immediate neighborhood, we cannot forget other earnest
and faithful friends of the slave, in distant parts of the country and
the world, who volunteered timely aid and sympathy to the Vigilance
Committee of Philadelphia. Not to mention any of this class would be to
fail to bestow honor where honor is due. We have only to allow the
friends to whom we allude, to speak for themselves through their
correspondence when their hearts were stirred in the interest of the
escaping slave, and they were practically doing unto others as they
would have others do unto them.

Here, truly, is pure philanthropy, that vital Christianity, that True
and Undefiled Religion before God and the Father, which is to visit the
fatherless and widow in their affliction, and to undo the heavy burden,
and let the oppressed go free. The posterity of the oppressed at least,
will need such evidences of tender regard and love as here evinced. In
those days, such expressions of Christian benevolence were cheering in
the extreme. From his able contribution to Anti-slavery papers, and his
fearless and eloquent advocacy of the cause of the down-trodden slave in
the pulpit, on the platform, and in the social circle, the name of Rev.
N.R. Johnston, Reformed Presbyterian (of the old Covenanter faith), will
be familiar to many. But we think it safe to say that his fidelity and
devotion to the slave are nowhere more fully portrayed than in the
appended Underground Rail Road letters.


    TOPSHAM, VT., September 1st, 1855.

    WM. STILL, MY DEAR FRIEND:--I have the heart, but not the time,
    to write you a long letter. It is Saturday evening, and I am
    preparing to preach to-morrow afternoon from Heb. xiii. 3,
    "Remember them that are in bonds as bound with them." This will
    be my second sermon from this text. Sabbath before last I
    preached from it, arguing and illustrating the proposition,
    deduced from it, that "the great work to which we are now called
    is the abolition of Slavery, or the emancipation of the slave,"
    showing our duty as _philanthropists_. To-morrow I intend to
    point out our duty as _citizens_. Some to whom I minister, I
    know, will call it a political speech; but I have long since
    determined to speak for the dumb what is in my heart and in my
    Bible, let men hear or forbear. I am accountable to the God of
    the oppressed, not to man. If I have his favor, why need I
    regard man's disfavor. Many besides the members of my own church
    come out regularly to hear me. Some of them are pro-slavery
    politicians. The consequence is, I preach much on the subject of
    Slavery. And while I have a tongue to speak, and lips to pray,
    they shall never be sealed or silent so long as millions of dumb
    have so few to speak for them.

    But poor Passmore Williamson is in bonds. Let us also remember
    him, as bound with him. He has many sympathizers. I am glad you
    did not share the same fate. For some reasons I am sorry you
    have fallen into the hands of thieves. For some others I am
    glad. It will make you more devoted to your good work.
    Persecution always brightens the Christian, and gives more zeal
    to the true philanthropist. I hope you will come off victorious.
    I pray for you and your co-laborers and co-sufferers.

    My good brother, I am greatly indebted to you for your continued
    kindness. The Lord reward you.

    I have a scholarship in an Ohio College, Geneva Hall, which will
    entitle me--any one I may send--to six years tuition. It is an
    Anti-slavery institution, and wholly under Anti-slavery control
    and influence. They want colored students to prepare them for
    the great field of labor open to men of talent and piety of that
    class. When I last saw you I purposed talking to you about this
    matter, but was disappointed very much in not getting to take
    tea with you, as I partly promised. Have you a son ready for
    college? or for the grammar school? Do you know any promising
    young man who would accept my scholarship? Or would your
    brother's son, Peter or Levin, like to have the benefit of it?
    If so, you are at liberty to promise it to any one whom you
    think I would be willing to educate. Write me at your earliest
    convenience, about this matter.


           *       *       *       *       *


    I presume the Standard will contain full accounts of the
    Norristown meeting, the Williamson case, and your own and those
    connected. If it does not, I will thank you to write me fully.


           *       *       *       *       *


    What causes the delay of that book, the History of Peter Still's
    Family, etc.? I long to see it.

    The Lord bless you in your labors for the slave.

    Yours, etc.,

    N.R. JOHNSTON.





    TOPSHAM, VT., December 26th, 1855.

    WM. STILL, MY DEAR FRIEND:--I wrote to you some two or three
    weeks ago, enclosing the letter to the care of a friend in
    Philadelphia, whom I wished to introduce to you. I have had no
    answer to that letter, and I am afraid you have not received it,
    or that you have written me, and I have not received yours. In
    that letter I wished to receive information respecting the best
    way to expend money for the aid of fugitives. Lest you may not
    have received it, I write you again, though briefly.

    A few of the Anti-slavery friends, mostly ladies, in our village
    have formed an Anti-slavery Society and sewing circle, the
    proceeds of which are to go to aid needy or destitute fugitive
    slaves. They have appointed me corresponding secretary. In
    obedience to my instructions, and that I may fulfill my
    promises, I want to find out from you the desired information.
    We want to give the little money raised, in such a way that
    fugitives who are really needy will be benefited by it. Write me
    as soon as possible, where and to whom we should send the funds
    when raised. I have thought that you of the Vigilance Committee,
    in Philadelphia had need of it. Or, if not, you can tell us
    where money is needed. Probably you know of some one in Canada
    who acts for the needy there. So many impositions have been
    palmed off upon charitable abolitionists, I am afraid to act in
    such a case without the directions of one who knows all about
    these things. Is money needed to help those escaping? If so,
    should we send to New York, Philadelphia, or where else? When I
    was in New York last, a young man from Richmond, Va., assuming
    the name of Robert Johnston, who had come by steamboat to
    Philadelphia, and whom you had directed to the Anti-slavery
    office in New York, had only one dollar in money. His fare had
    to be paid by a friend there, the treasurer of the fund being
    absent. I know that they nearly all need money, or clothing. We
    want to send our money wherever it is most needed, to help the
    destitute, or those in danger, and where it will be faithfully
    applied. Write me fully, giving specific directions; and I will
    read your letter to the society. And as I have been waiting
    anxiously, for some two weeks or more, for an answer to my
    previous letter, but am disappointed unless you have written
    very recently, I will be much obliged if you will write on the
    reception of this. Any information you may communicate,
    respecting the doing of your section of the Underground Railway
    will be read before the society with much interest.

    If you know the address of any one in Canada, who would be a
    good correspondent respecting this matter, please give me his
    name.


           *       *       *       *       *


    My dear brother, go on in your good work; and the God of the
    oppressed sustain and reward you, is my earnest prayer.

    Yours, fraternally, in our common cause,

    N.R. JOHNSTON.





    TOPSHAM, VT., December 18th, 1856.

    WM. STILL, VERY DEAR FRIEND:--I will be much pleased to hear
    from you and our common cause in Pennsylvania. I am so far
    removed, away here in Yankeedom, that I hear nothing from that
    quarter but by the public prints. And as for the Underground
    Railway, of course, I hear nothing, except now and then, I would
    be greatly pleased if you would write me the state of its funds
    and progress. Whatever you write will be interesting.

    The Topsham Sewing Circle has begun its feeble operations again.
    Owing to much opposition, a very few attend, consequently little
    is made. The ladies, however, have some articles on hand unsold,
    which will bring some money ere long. I wish you would write me
    another long letter in detail of interesting fugitives, etc.,
    such as you wrote last winter, and I will have it read before
    the circle. Your letter last winter was heard by the ladies with
    great interest. You are probably not aware that fugitives are
    never seen here. Indeed the one half of the people have never
    seen more than a half-dozen of colored people. There are none in
    all this region.

    I am lending Peter Still--the book--to my neighbors. It is
    devoured with great interest. It does good. I think, however, if
    I had been writing such a book, I would have wedged in much more
    testimony against slavery and its horrid accompaniments and
    consequences.

    I would be glad to hear how Peter and his family are prospering.

    Do you see my friends, Mr. Orr and Rev. Willson, now-a-days? Do
    they help in the good cause?

    If the ladies here should make up fine shirts for men, or
    children's clothes of various kinds, would they be of use at
    Philadelphia, or New York, to fugitives? Or would it not be
    advisable to send them there? The ladies here complain that they
    cannot sell what they make.

    My dear brother, be not discouraged in your work, your labor of
    love. The prospect before the poor slave is indeed dark, dark!
    But the power shall not always be on the side of the oppressor.
    God reigns. A day of vengeance will come, and that soon.

    Mrs. Stowe makes Dred utter many a truth. Would that God would
    write it indelibly on the heart of the nation. But the people
    will not hear, and the cup of iniquity will soon fill to
    overflowing; and whose ears will not be made to tingle when the
    God of Sabaoth awakes to plead the cause of the dumb?

    Yours, very sincerely,

    N.R. JOHNSTON.

    P.S. When I was in New York last Fall, October, I was in the
    Anti-Slavery office one day, when a friend in the office showed
    me a dispatch just received from Philadelphia, signed W.S.,
    which gave notice of "six parcels" coming by the train, etc. And
    before I left the office the "parcels" came in, each on two
    legs. Strange parcels, that would run away on legs.

    My heart leaped for joy at seeing these rescued ones. O that God
    would arise and break the yoke of oppression! Let us labor on
    and ever, until our work is done, until all are free.

    Since the late Republican farce has closed I hope to get some
    more subscribers for the Standard. Honest men's eyes will be
    opened after a while, and the standard of right and expediency
    be elevated. Let us "hope on and ever."

    Yours, for the right,

    N.R.J.





    TOPSHAM, VT., April 3d, 1858.

    DEAR FRIEND STILL:--I entreat you not to infer from my tardiness
    or neglect, that I am forgetful of my dear friend in
    Philadelphia. For some time past I have done injustice to many
    of my friends, in not paying my debts in epistolary
    correspondence. Some of my dearest friends have cause to censure
    me. But you must pardon me. I have two letters of yours on hand,
    unanswered. One of them I read to the Sewing Circle; and part of
    the other. For them I most heartily thank you. You are far
    kinder to me than I deserve. May God reward you.

    I long to see you. My head and heart is full of the cause of the
    slave. I fear I give the subject too much relative importance.
    Is this possible? I preach, lecture, and write for the slave
    continually. And yet I don't do enough. Still I fear I neglect
    the great concerns of religion at home, in my own heart, in my
    congregation, and in the community.

    I wish we were located near to each other. We are far separated.
    I am almost isolated. You are surrounded by many friends of the
    cause. Still we are laboring on the same wall, though far apart.
    Are we not near in spirit?

    You see by the papers that we have been trying to do something
    in our Green Mountain State. The campaign has fairly begun. We
    will carry the battle to the gate.

    I see our friend, Miss Watkins, is still pleading for the dumb.
    Noble girl! I love her for her devotedness to a good cause. Oh,
    that her voice could be heard by the millions! I hope that we
    can have her again in Vermont.

    Give my kind regards to our mutual friend, Miller McKim. Will I
    not see him and you at the anniversary in New York?

    Do you ever see Rev. Willson? Is he doing anything for the
    cause? I wish I could peep into your house to-night, and see if
    there are any "packages" on hand. God bless you in your labors
    of love.

    Yours, truly, for the slave,

    N.R. JOHNSTON.


While it was not in the power of Mr. Johnston and his coadjutors, to
render any great amount of material aid to the Committee, as they had
not been largely blessed with this world's goods, nevertheless, the
sympathy shown was as highly valued, as if they had given thousands of
dollars. Not unfrequently has the image of this singularly faithful
minister entered the writer's mind as he once appeared when visiting the
Synod of his church in Philadelphia. Having the Underground Rail Road
cause at heart, he brought with him--all the way from Vermont--his trunk
well filled with new shirts and under-clothing for the passengers on
that Road. It was characteristic of the man, and has ever since been
remembered with pleasure.

From another quarter, hundreds of miles from Philadelphia, similar
tokens of interest in the cause of the fleeing bondmen were manifested
by a Ladies' Anti-slavery Society, in Western New York, which we must
here record. As the proffered aid was wholly unsolicited, and as the
Committee had no previous knowledge whatever of the existence of the
society, or any of its members, and withal, as the favors conferred,
came at times when the cause was peculiarly in need (the Committee
oft-times being destitute of clothing or money), the idea that the
Underground Rail Road was providentially favored, in this respect, was
irresistible.

We therefore take great pleasure in commemorating the good deeds of the
society, by copying the following letters from its president, Mrs. Dr.
Brooks:


    ELLINGTON, Nov. 21st, 1859.

    MR. WILLIAM STILL:--Dear Sir:--In the above-named place, some
    five years since there was formed a Ladies' Anti-slavery
    Society, which has put forth its feeble endeavors to aid the
    cause of "breaking every yoke and letting the oppressed go
    free," and we trust, through our means, others have been made
    glad of heart. Every year we have sent a box of clothing,
    bedding, etc., to the aid of the fugitive, and wishing to send
    it where it would be of the most service, we have it suggested
    to us, to send to you the box we have at present. You would
    confer a favor upon the members of our society, by writing us,
    giving a detail of that which would be the most service to you,
    and whether or no it would be more advantageous to you than some
    nearer station, and we will send or endeavor to, that which
    would benefit you most.

    William Wells Brown visited our place a short time since,
    recommending us to send to you in preference to Syracuse, where
    we sent our last box.

    Please write, letting me know what most is needed to aid you in
    your glorious work, a work which will surely meet its reward.

    ELLINGTON, Chautauqua Co., N.Y., Dec. 7th, 1859.

    MR. STILL:--Dear Sir:--Yours of the 29th, was duly and
    gratefully received, although the greater portion of your
    epistle, of a necessity, portrayed the darker side of the
    picture, yet we have great reason to be thankful for the growing
    interest there is for the cause throughout the free States, for
    it certainly is on the increase, even in our own locality. There
    are those who, five years since, were (ashamed, must I say it!)
    to bear the appellation of "_Anti-slavery_," who can now
    manfully bear the one then still more repellant of
    _Abolitionist_. All this we wish to feel thankful for, and wish
    their number may never grow less.

    The excitement relative to the heroic John Brown, now in his
    grave, has affected the whole North, or at least every one who
    has a heart in his breast, particularly this portion of the
    State, which is so decidedly Anti-slavery.

    At a meeting of our Society, to-day, at which your letter was
    read, it was thought best that I should reply to it, a request
    with which I cheerfully comply. We would like to hear from you,
    and learn the directions to be given to our box, which will be
    ready to send as soon as we can hear from you. Please give us
    all necessary information, and oblige our Society.

    You have the kind wishes and prayers of all the members, that
    you may be the instrument of doing much good to those in bonds,
    and may God speed the time when every yoke shall be broken, and
    let the oppressed go free.

    Yours, truly,

    Mrs. DR. BROOKS.

    P.S. I have just learned that John Brown's body passed through
    Dunkirk, a few miles from this place, yesterday. A funeral
    sermon is to be preached in this place one week from next
    Sabbath, for the good old man.

    Mrs. DR. B.

    WILLIAM STILL:--Dear Sir:--Enclosed are $2,00, to pay freightage
    on the box of bedding, wearing apparel, etc., that has been sent
    to your address. It has been thought best to send you a schedule
    of the contents of said box. Trusting it will be acceptable, and
    be the means of assisting the poor fugitive on his perilous way,
    you have the prayers of our Society, that you may be prospered
    in your work of mercy, and you surely will meet with your reward
    according to your merciful acts.

The road was doing a flourishing business during the short time that
this station received aid and sympathy from the Ladies' Anti-slavery
Society of Ellington, and little did we dream that its existence would
so soon be rendered null and void by the utter overthrow of Slavery.

We have great pleasure in stating that beyond our borders also, across
the ocean, there came help to a laudable degree in the hour of need. The
numbers of those who aided in this special work, however, were very few
and far between, a hundred per cent. less (so far as the receipts of the
Philadelphia Committee were concerned), than was supposed by
slave-holders and their sympathizers, judging from their oft repeated
allegations on this subject.

It is true, that the American Anti-slavery Society and kindred
associations, received liberal contributions from a few warm-hearted and
staunch abolitionists abroad, to aid the great work of abolishing
Slavery. In reference to the Philadelphia Vigilance Committee, we are
safe in saying, that, except from a few sources, no direct aid came. How
true this was of other stations, we do not pretend to know or speak, but
in the directions above alluded to, we feel that the cause was placed
under lasting obligations. The Webbs of Dublin, and the Misses Wighams,
of Scotland, representatives of the Edinburgh Ladies' Emancipation
Society, were constantly in correspondence with leading abolitionists in
different parts of the country, manifesting a deep interest in the
general cause, and were likewise special stockholders of the Underground
Rail Road of Philadelphia. In common with stockholders at home, these
trans-atlantic investors were willing to receive their shares of
dividends in the answer of a good conscience, or, in other words, from
the satisfaction and pleasure derivable from a consciousness of having
done what they could to alleviate the sufferings of the oppressed
struggling to be free. Having thus shown their faith by their works it
would be unjust not to make honorable mention of them.

Last, though not least, at the risk of wounding the feelings of one who
preferred not to let the left hand know what the right hand doeth, we
may contemplate the philanthropic labors of one, whose generosity and
benevolence knew no bounds; whose friendship devotion and liberality,
were felt in all the principal stations of the Underground Rail Road;
whose heart went out after the millions in fetters, the fleeing
fugitive, the free, proscribed, the ignorant deprived of education;
whose house was the home of the advocate of the slave from the United
States, especially if he wore a colored skin or had been a slave. We
would not venture to say how many of the enslaved this kind hand helped
to purchase (Frederick Douglass and many others, being of the number.)

How many were assisted in procuring an education, how many who pined in
slave prisons were aided, how many fleeing over the perilous Underground
Rail Road were benefited, the All-seeing Eye alone knoweth;
nevertheless, we are happy to be able to give our readers some idea of
the unwearied labors of the friend to whom we allude. Here again we are
compelled to resort to private correspondence which took place when
Cotton was King, and the Slave-power of the South could boastingly say,
in the language of the apocalyptic woman, "I sit as a queen, and shall
see no sorrow," when that power was maddened to desperation, by the
heroism of the martyr, John Brown, and the fettered bondmen were ever
and anon traveling over the Underground Rail Road. In this "darkest
hour, just before the break of day," the heart of the friend of whom we
speak, was greatly moved to consider the wants of the oppressed in
various directions.

How worthily and successfully her labors gave evidence of an earnest
devotion to freedom, the mode and measures adopted by her, to awaken
sympathy in the breast of the benevolent of her own countrymen, and how
noble her example, may be learned from a small pamphlet and explanatory
letters which, when written, were intended especially for private use,
but which we now feel constrained to copy from a sense of justice to
disinterested philanthropy.



PAMPHLET, AND LETTERS


FROM MRS. ANNA H. RICHARDSON, OF NEWCASTLE, ENGLAND.


TO THE FRIENDS OF THE SLAVE.



    DEAR FRIENDS--For some months past my dear husband and I have
    wished very gratefully to thank you for having so kindly
    assisted us in various Anti-Slavery efforts, and we now think it
    quite time to give an account of our stewardship, and also to
    lay before you several items of interesting intelligence
    received from different parts of the United States. We will
    thank you to look upon this intelligence as private, and must
    request you to guard against any portion of it being reprinted.

    WILLIAM S. BAILEY.--We have had great pleasure in forwarding
    £222 to our valued correspondent, William S. Bailey, of Newport,
    Kentucky; £160 of this sum in response to a circular issued at
    Newcastle in the summer of last year, and received by our
    friend, David Oliver, who acted as treasurer, and the remainder
    chiefly collected by our dear young friends in England and
    Ireland, after reading the account of his little daughter,
    "Laura." This money has been very thankfully acknowledged, with
    the exception of the last remittance just now on the road.

    Most of our readers will be aware that W.S. Bailey's
    printing-office and premises were again ruthlessly attacked
    after the Harper's Ferry outbreak, on the unfounded assumption
    that he was meditating a similar proceeding, and that it was
    unsafe for a free press to be any longer tolerated in Kentucky.
    His forms and type were accordingly dragged through the streets
    of Newport, and a considerable portion of them flung by a mob
    (of "gentlemen") into the Ohio River. A few extracts from his
    own letters will pretty fully explain both his past and present
    position. The subscription list on his behalf is still open, and
    any further assistance for this heroic man and his noble-hearted
    family will be very gratefully received and forwarded.


        "NEWPORT, KENTUCKY, Nov. 19th, 1859.

        "From my letter of the 7th inst. you will have learned
        the sad intelligence that my printing-office has been
        destroyed by a brutal mob of Pro-Slavery men. Through
        the money I received from you and other friends in this
        country I was moving the cause of freedom in all parts
        of Kentucky. The people seemed to grasp our platform
        with eagerness, and the slaveholders became alarmed to
        see their wish to read and discuss its simple truths.
        Hence they plotted together to devise a stratagem by
        which they could destroy _The Free South_, and in the
        meantime the Harper's Ferry difficulty, by Mr. Brown,
        was seized upon to excite the people against me, and the
        most extravagant lies were told about me, as trying to
        excite slaves to rebellion; intending to seize the
        United States barracks at this place, arm the negroes,
        and commence war upon slave-holders. All these lies were
        told as profound secrets to the people by the tools of
        the slave-power. But these lies have already exploded,
        and the people are resuming their common sense again.

        "I tried your plan of non-resistance with all my power.
        I pleaded with all the earnestness of my soul, and so
        did my wife and daughters, but though I am certain many
        were moved in conscience against the savage outrage, and
        did their work with a stinging heart, yet they felt that
        they must stick to their party, and complete the
        destruction. Slavery, indeed, makes the most hardened
        savages the world ever knew. The savage war-whoop of the
        Indian never equalled their dastardly cry of 'shoot
        him,' 'cut his throat,' 'stab him,' and such like words
        most maliciously spoken."  *  *  "Slavery is the cause
        of this devilish spirit in men; but this outrage has
        gained me many friends, and will do much towards putting
        down Slavery in the state. It will also add many
        thousand votes to the republican presidential candidate
        in 1860. God grant it may work out a great good!"  *  *
        *  *  "I Want to get started again as soon as I possibly
        can. As soon as I can raise 1,000 dollars, I can make a
        beginning, and soon after you will see _The Free South_
        again, and I trust a much handsomer sheet than it was
        before."





        NEWPORT, January 6th, 1860.

        "Yours of 12mo. 17th, 1860, is received, containing a
        draft for £50, and another of the 'Little Laura' books,
        which, thank God, is doing some good in Newport and
        Covington, in the hands of two Christian friends. The
        renewed obligations under which the good people of
        England, through your instrumentality, place me and my
        abused people, call for expressions of gratitude from
        both me and them beyond my ability to pen. But you can
        imagine how we ought to feel in our trials and wants to
        such kind friends as you. Neither I nor my Anti-Slavery
        friends here can express our thankfulness in the elegant
        language your better educated countrymen may feel we
        should use, but, by the Omnipotent Judge of all hearts,
        I trust our feeble effort will be accepted, and you and
        yours be blessed and protected now and for ever. Such
        encouragement strengthens me in the belief that the
        Spirit of God is abroad in the hearts of the people,
        moving them to sympathize with the poor, subjected
        slave."  *  *  *  *  "I have the promise of abler pens
        to aid me when I get started again; and I am glad to see
        that a poor working-man and his family have been the
        means of calling the attention of men of letters to
        assist in raising from the dust a crushed race of men;
        and although the red clouds of war hover thick around
        us, and vengeance lurks in secret places, I trust,
        through the guidance of an All-wise Director, to steer
        safely through the angry tide that now so often ebbs and
        flows around me; but should I fall, I trust, dear lady,
        that my dear wife and family may be remembered by the
        good and true."





        "NEWPORT, May 25th, 1860.

        "I am glad to tell you that we feel it a great victory
        over the slave power to be able to rise again from our
        ruins, and in the face of slave-owning despots denounce
        their inhumanity and their sins. I trust that Almighty
        God will continue to be with me and my dear family in
        this good work."   *  *  *  "You cannot but see, I
        think, by the southern press, that slave-holders begin
        to fear and tremble for the safety of their 'peculiar
        institution.' The death of John Brown is yet to be
        atoned for, by the slave-holding oligarchy. His undying
        spirit haunts them by day and by night, and in the midst
        of their voluptuous enjoyments, the very thought of John
        Brown chills their souls and poisons their pleasures.
        Their tarring and feathering of good citizens; their
        riding them upon rails, and ducking them, in dirty
        ponds; their destruction of liberty presses, and the
        hanging of John Brown and his friends, to intimidate men
        from the advocacy of freedom, will all come tumbling
        upon their own heads as a just retribution for their
        outrageous brutality. Only let us persevere, and
        oppressed humanity, bent in timid silence throughout the
        south, will rise and throw off the yoke of Slavery and
        rejoice in beholding itself _free_!"





        "NEWPORT, August 18.

        "I send you three copies of my paper. Since receiving
        your letter, I and my family have done all in our power
        to get it out, but we had to get old type from the
        foundry and sort it, to make the sheet the size you now
        see it. We hate to be put down by the influence of
        tyranny, and you cannot imagine our sorrow, anxiety,
        necessity and determination."  *  *  * "I have received,
        since the press was destroyed, 700 dollars in all, which
        has been spent in repairing and roofing our
        dwelling-house, and repairing the breaches made upon the
        office, together with mending the presses and procuring
        job type and some little for the paper, but nearly all
        the latter is old type. Our kindest thanks to the
        liberty-loving people of your country, Scotland, and
        Ireland, and tell them I shall never surrender the cause
        of freedom. A little money from all my friends, would
        soon reinstate me, and when they see my paper I trust it
        will cheer their hopes, and cause a new fire for liberty
        in Kentucky.

        "I cannot but sometimes ask in my closet meditations: O
        God of mercy and love, why permittest Thou these things?
        But still I hope for a change of mind in my enemies, and
        shall press onward to accomplish the great task
        seemingly allotted to me upon Kentucky soil."


    THE PERSECUTED BEREANS.--There is another call connected with
    Kentucky, which we wish to bring before our friends. At a
    village in that State, called Berea, (situated in Madison
    county), a little band of Christian men and women, had been
    pursuing their useful labors for some years past. They avowedly
    held Anti-slavery sentiments, but this was the beginning and end
    of their offending. They possessed a farm and saw-mill, etc.,
    and had established a flourishing school. These good people were
    quietly following their usual employments, when, in the early
    part of last winter, sixty-two armed Kentuckians rode upon
    horseback to their cottage doors, and summarily informed them
    that they must leave the State in ten days' time, or would be
    expelled from it forcibly. All pleading was hopeless, and any
    attempt at self-defence out of the question. They bowed before
    the storm, and hastily gathering up their garments, in three
    days' time were on their road to Ohio. Their three Christian
    pastors took the same course. One of the latter has since
    returned to Kentucky, to bury his youngest little boy, in a
    grave-yard attached to one of the churches there. He was enabled
    to preach to the people who assembled on the occasion, but was
    not allowed to remain in his native State.

    Another of the exiles ventured to go back to Berea, but this
    immediately led to an outbreak of popular feeling, for his
    saw-mill was set on fire by the mob, and presently destroyed.
    The exiles are consequently still in Ohio, or wandering about in
    search of employment. We have been privileged in receiving two
    letters respecting them, from one of their excellent pastors,
    John G. Fee. This gentleman is himself, the son of a
    slave-holder, but gave up his earthly patrimony many years since
    for conscience' sake, and has since made it the business of his
    life to proclaim the gospel in its purity, and to use every
    available means for directing all to Christ.

    When speaking of Berea, Mr. Fee remarks: "The land was poor, but
    the situation beautiful, with good water, and a favorable
    location, in some respects. We could have had locations more
    fertile and more easy of access, but more exposed to the
    slave-power. It was five miles from a turnpike road, with quite
    a population around it for a slave State."

    In one of Mr. Fee's letters he introduces a subject which we
    wish especially to bring before our friends, feeling almost sure
    that many of them will respond to its importance:

    "You ask, he says, if there are not noble-hearted young people
    in slave-holding families? There is one whom I desire to commend
    to your special prayer and regard, Elizabeth Rawlings, daughter
    of John H. Rawlings, of Madison county, Kentucky. He was once a
    slave-holder, but has twice been a delegate to our Free-soil
    National Conventions, and is a strong friend of freedom. His
    daughter has had small opportunities for acquiring knowledge,
    but was in our school at Berea, and making rapid progress. Our
    school was not only Anti-slavery, but avowedly Anti-caste. This
    made it the more odious. When Mr. Rogers and others were about
    to be driven away, she announced that she would continue the
    school on the same principles. Accordingly she went into the
    school-room after a few days, with a little band of small
    scholars, and has perseveringly kept it up. This noble and
    brave-hearted young woman is about twenty-two years of age; has
    a very vigorous mind; acquires knowledge very rapidly; is very
    modest; and is, I trust, a true believer in Christ. I desire to
    see her fitted for the post of teacher. One year's study would
    greatly benefit her. She has not gone beyond grammar and
    arithmetic. I have not means or would at once give her those
    advantages she needs. I once had a small patrimony, but expended
    it in freedom's cause, and now live on the small salary of a
    [Home] Missionary. I have a daughter of fifteen, as far advanced
    as Miss Rawlings. I want to train and educate them both for
    teaching, and had thought to educate the latter, and suggest to
    some one to educate the other. I do not urge, but simply
    suggest. This might be another cord binding the two continents.
    Lewis Tappan, of New York, would receive to transmit, and I
    would report."

    Now if we may lay before you, dear friends, our hearts' inquiry,
    it is this: "Cannot we in England, raise £50 or £60 for one
    year's schooling for these two dear girls, Elizabeth Rawlings
    and J.G. Fee's daughter?" It seems to us, that the one deserves
    it from her noble daring, the other as a little tribute to her
    father's virtues. How delightful it would be if these two young
    people could become able teachers of our own rearing, and in
    days to come, be looked to as maintaining schools of an elevated
    character upon their native soil! We have laid the case before a
    few kind friends, and already had the pleasure of forwarding £8
    to Mr. Fee's care, on behalf of his valued young friend,
    Elizabeth Rawlings.

    CORNELIA WILLIAMS.--The next person to be referred to is
    Cornelia Williams, a bright young niece of our friend, Henry H.
    Garnet's, whom many of our friends kindly assisted to redeem
    from Slavery, in North Carolina, about three years since. We
    rejoice to say this dear girl is going on very satisfactorily.
    She has been diligently pursuing her studies in a school at
    Nantucket, and appears to be much esteemed by all who know her.
    She kindly sends us a little letter now and then, again
    returning her glowing thanks to all who assisted in procuring
    her freedom. Her mother, Dinah Williams (also a slave a few
    years since, and redeemed in part by the surplus of 'the Weims
    Ransom Fund'), has married an estimable Baptist minister within
    the last year, and Cornelia resides under their roof.

    FREDERICK DOUGLASS.--It is known that our much-valued friend,
    Frederick Douglass, left this country suddenly for America last
    spring, chiefly on account of the decease of a most beloved
    little girl. Till quite recently he was intending to return to
    England very soon, but this is for the present delayed, on
    account of increasing and pressing engagements in the United
    States. We take the liberty of quoting an extract from one of
    his letters:


        "ROCHESTER, July 2d, 1860.

        "You hold up before me the glorious promises contained
        in the sacred Scriptures. These are needed by none more
        than by those who have presumed to put themselves to the
        work of accomplishing the abolition of Slavery in this
        country. There is scarcely one single interest, social,
        moral, religious, or physical, which is not in some way
        connected with this stupendous evil. On the side of the
        oppressor there is power, now as in the earlier days of
        the world. I find much comfort in the thought that I am
        but a passenger on board of this ship of life. I have
        not the management committed to me. I am to obey orders,
        and leave the rest to the great Captain whose wisdom is
        able to direct. I have only to go on in His fear and in
        His spirit, uttering with pen and tongue the whole truth
        against Slavery, leaving to Him the honor and the glory
        of destroying this mighty work of the devil. I long for
        the end of my people's bondage, and would give all I
        possess to witness the great jubilee; but God can wait,
        and surely I may. If He, whose pure eyes cannot look
        upon sin with allowance, can permit the day of freedom
        to be deferred, I certainly can work and wait. The times
        are just now a little brighter; but I will walk by
        faith, not by sight, for all grounds of hope founded on
        external appearance, have thus far signally failed and
        broken down under me. Twenty years ago, Slavery did
        really _seem_ to be rapidly hastening to its fall, but
        ten years ago, the Fugitive Slave Bill, and the efforts
        to enforce it, changed the whole appearance of the
        struggle. Anti-slavery in an abolition sense, has been
        ever since battling against heavy odds, both in Church
        and State. Nevertheless, God reigns, and we need not
        despair, and I for one do not. I know, at any rate, no
        better work for me during the brief period I am to stay
        on the earth, than is found in pleading the cause of the
        down-trodden and the dumb.

        "Since I reached home I have had the satisfaction of
        passing nearly a score on to Canada, only two women
        among them all. The constant meeting with these
        whip-scarred brothers will not allow me to become
        forgetful of the four millions still in bonds."


    Our friends may, perhaps, remember that the cost of _Frederick
    Douglass' paper_ is but five shillings per annum (with the
    exception of a penny per month at the door for postage.) It is a
    very interesting publication, and amply repays the trifling
    outlay. F.D. would be glad to increase the number of his British
    readers. He also continues gratefully to receive any aid from
    this country for the assistance of the fugitives who are so
    often taking refuge under his roof. Another letter of his
    remarks, when speaking of them: "They usually tarry with us only
    during the night, and are forwarded to Canada by the morning
    train. We give them supper, lodging, and breakfast; pay their
    expenses, and give them a half dollar over."

    FUGITIVE SLAVES.--We next turn to the communication of another
    warm friend to the fugitives in the State of ----. The following
    is an extract from a recent letter of his:


        "We have had within the last week just nineteen
        Underground passengers. Fifteen came last Saturday,
        between the hours of six in the morning and eleven at
        night. Three only were females, wives of men in the
        parties, the rest were all able-bodied young men. That
        they were all likely-looking it needed no southern eye
        to decide, and that their hearts burned within them for
        freedom was apparent in every look of their
        countenances. But it is only of one arrival that my time
        will allow me to speak on the present occasion.

        This consisted of two married couples, and two single
        young men. They had been a week on the way. To
        accomplish the desired object they could see no way so
        feasible as to cross the ---- Bay. By inquiry they
        gained instructions as to the direction they should
        steer to strike for the lighthouse on the opposite
        shore. Consequently they invested six dollars in a
        little boat, and at once prepared themselves for this
        most fearful adventure. To the water and their little
        bark they stealthily repaired, and off they started. For
        some distance they rowed not far from the shore. Being
        in sight of land, they were spied by the ever-watchful
        slave-holder or some one not favorable to their escape.
        Hence a small boat, containing four white men, soon put
        out after the fugitives. On overhauling them, stern
        orders were given to surrender. The boat the runaways
        were in was claimed, if not the party themselves. With
        determined words the fugitives declared that the boat
        was their own property, and that they would not give it
        up; they said they would die before they would do so. At
        this sign of resistance one of the white men, with an
        oar, struck the head of one of the fugitives, which
        knocked him down. At the same moment another white man
        seized the chain of their boat, and the struggle became
        fearful in the extreme for a few moments. However, the
        same spirit that prompted the effort to be free, moved
        one of the heroic black bondmen to apply the oar to the
        head of one of their pursuers, which straightway laid
        him prostrate. The whites, like old Apollyon in the
        Pilgrim's Progress, at this decided indication that
        their precious lives might not be spared if they did not
        avail themselves of an immediate retreat, suddenly
        parted from their antagonists. Not being contented,
        however, thus to give up the struggle, after getting
        some yards off, they fired a loaded gun in the midst of
        the fugitives, peppering two of them considerably about
        the head and face, and one about the arms. As the shot
        was light they were not much damaged, however, at any
        rate not discouraged. Not forgetting which way to steer
        across the bay, in the direction of the lighthouse, they
        rowed for that point with all possible speed, but their
        bark being light, and the wind and rough water by no
        means manageable, ere they reached the desired shore
        they were carried a considerable distance off their
        course, in the immediate vicinity of a small island.
        Leaving their boat they went upon the island, the women
        sick, and there reposed without food, utterly ignorant
        of where they were for one whole day and night, without
        being able to conjecture when or where they should find
        free land for which they had so long and fervently
        prayed. However, after thus resting, feeling compelled
        to start on again, they set off on foot. They had not
        walked a mile ere, providentially, they fell in with an
        oyster man and a little boy waiting for the tide. With
        him they ventured to converse, and soon felt that he
        might be trusted with, at least, a hint of their
        condition. Accordingly they made him acquainted in part
        with their piteous story, and he agreed to bring them
        within fifteen miles of ---- for twenty-five dollars,
        all the capital they had. Being as good as his word, he
        did not leave them fifteen miles off the city, but
        brought them directly to it."  *  *  *  * "How happy
        they were at finding themselves in the hands of friends,
        and surrounded with flattering prospects of soon
        reaching Canada you may imagine, but I could not
        describe."[A]

        [Footnote A: In those days the writer in giving
        information enjoined the utmost secresy, considering
        that the cause might be sadly damaged simply by being
        inadvertently exposed even by friends, thousands of
        miles away. The Pro-slavery-mob spirit at that time was
        also very rampant in Philadelphia and other northern
        cities, threatening abolitionists and all concerned in
        the work of aiding the slave.]


    Thanks to the benevolent bounty of several kind donors, we had
    lately the pleasure of sending a few pounds to the writer of the
    foregoing letter. We omit his name and residence. He belongs,
    like Douglass, to the proscribed race. Who would not help these
    generous-hearted men, who are devoting their whole energies to
    the well-being of the crushed and downtrodden? We are the more
    encouraged to send out this little sheet, made up of thanks and
    requisitions, because occasional inquiries are reaching us of
    "What can we do for the slave? We are hearing but little about
    him, and do not know how to work on his behalf." Allow us to say
    to one and all, who may be thus circumstanced, that we do not
    look for great things, but that if they can levy a shilling a
    year from all who feel for the injured bondman, these little
    sums would soon mount up and prove of incalculable service to
    those who are struggling for freedom. As to the special destiny
    of these shillings or half-crowns, let the subscribers choose
    for themselves, and their kind aid will be sure to be truly
    welcome to the party receiving it. We do not ask for such
    contributions to be forwarded through Newcastle unless this be a
    matter of convenience to those concerned. If there be other
    modes of sending to the United States within the reach of the
    friends, who receive this paper, let them by all means be used.
    We are always happy to receive aid for the fugitives or for any
    other Anti-slavery cause, and consider it no trouble at all to
    send it on, but do not wish to be monopolizing. As far as
    Kentucky is concerned, that State being distant, and mob-law
    rampant there, we shall continue gratefully to receive
    assistance on its behalf, and to avail ourselves of the
    accustomed mode of reaching it, this having been proved to be
    both safe and easy.

    FREE LABOR PRODUCE.--And lastly, as to the long-prized
    principle, to our minds the very alphabet of Anti-Slavery
    action, the importance of encouraging the growth and consumption
    of Free produce rather than that raised by the sweat and blood
    of the bondman. Our convictions of the righteousness of this
    course are as strong as they ever were; but perhaps we hoped too
    much, relied too fondly on the conscientiousness of the British
    Anti-Slavery public, in supposing that a sufficient number of
    individuals could be found prepared to make a slight sacrifice
    for humanity's sake, and to keep the oppressed continually in
    mind by a little untiring pains-taking. We hardly supposed that
    the most strenuous efforts in this direction would be enough to
    affect the British market; but we did believe, and believe
    still, that not only is there a consistency in a preference for
    free produce, but that this preference is encouraging to the
    free laborer, and that humanly speaking nothing is more
    calculated to nerve his hand and heart for vigorous effort. The
    principle of abstinence from slave produce may be smiled at, but
    we are quite sure it is an honest one, and, as a good old
    proverb observes, "It takes a great many bushels full of earth
    to bury a truth."

    But while this self-denying protest has been going on in a few
    limited circles, how great is the advance that free labor has
    been making within the last two years! Who is to say whether
    some of those quiet testimonies may not have contributed to
    erect that mighty machinery that is now adding to its wheels and
    springs from day to day, and which bids fair at no distant
    period to supersede slave labor and its long train of sorrow and
    oppression?

    Earnest lectures have just been delivered in Newcastle by our
    colored friend, Dr. M.R. Delany, lately engaged in a tour of
    observation in West Africa, where he longs to establish a
    nourishing colony of his people, whose express object shall be
    to put down the abominable Slave-trade and to cultivate free
    cotton and other tropical produce. We wish this brave man every
    encouragement in his noble enterprise. He has secured the
    confidence of "The African Aid Society," in London, one of whose
    earliest measures has been to assist him with funds. The present
    Secretary of the society is Frederick W. Fitzgerald, 7 Adam
    Street, Strand, London.

    And who need speak of the Zambesi and Dr. Livingston, or of
    Central or Eastern Africa; of India, or Australia, or of the
    prolific West India Islands?

    As we prepare this little sheet, a kind letter has come in from
    Stephen Bourne, for many years a stipendiary magistrate in
    Jamaica, and now the ardent promoter of a cotton-growing company
    of that island. He says to us, when writing from London, on the
    19th inst., "Our scheme embraces more than meets the eye, and to
    illustrate this, I send a map (with prospectus) of the proposed
    estate, by which you will see that we reckon on obtaining cotton
    by free labor and by mechanical agency from Jamaica, at a price
    so far below that at which it can be produced by slave labor,
    that if we succeed, we shall put an end to the whole system, as
    no one will be able to afford to carry it on in competition with
    free labor."  *  *  * "Jamaica is much nearer and easier of
    access for fugitives from Cuba and Porto Rico, than Canada is to
    Georgia, Virginia, or Louisiana. If, therefore, we can offer
    them an asylum and profitable employment on the estate, we shall
    open up a new Underground Rail Road, or rather enable the slaves
    to escape from Cuba by getting into a boat, and in one night
    finding their way to freedom."  *  *  *  "There is no doubt they
    could do this at much less risk than slaves now incur, in order
    to obtain liberty in America."

    The proposed estate in Jamaica consists of about one thousand
    acres, and the shares in this company are £10 each, £1 only to
    be called up immediately, the rest by instalments. The liability
    is limited. Full information may be obtained by addressing
    Stephen Bourne, Esq., 55 Charing Cross, London, or the Secretary
    of the "Jamaica Cotton-growing Company," C. W. Streatfield, Esq.
    We rejoice to see that this new company is being supported not
    only by benevolent philanthropists and capitalists in London,
    but by experienced Manchester manufacturers; among the rest by
    the excellent Thomas Clegg, so well known for his persevering
    efforts in West Africa, and by Thomas Bazley, M.P. for
    Manchester, and a most extensive cotton spinner. Their mills
    would alone, consume the cotton grown on three such estates as
    that which it is proposed to cultivate. There is abundant room,
    therefore, for cultivation of cotton by the emancipated
    freeholders.

    Communications have also reached us from Demerara. Charles
    Rattray, a valuable Scotch missionary in that colony, was in
    England last spring, and went back to his adopted country with
    his mind full fraught with the importance of cotton growing
    within its borders. He happened to have small samples of
    Demerara cotton with him. These were shown to cotton-brokers and
    manufacturers in Liverpool and Manchester, and were pronounced
    to be most excellent--so much so, that specimen gins and a
    supply of cotton-seed were kindly presented to him at the latter
    place, before he left England. Mr. Rattray is now bringing the
    subject before his people, and is also intending to plant with
    cotton some ground belonging to the Mission station.

    But we will not further enlarge. Commending our cause to Him,
    who has promised never to forget the poor and needy, and that in
    His own good time He will arise for their deliverance and "break
    every yoke."

    I remain, sincerely and respectfully, your friend,

    Anna H. Richardson.

    P.S. Since writing the above, we have seen it stated in the
    _Principia,_ a New York paper, that William S. Bailey has been
    arrested on a charge of publishing an incendiary paper, and held
    to bail in the sum of $1,000, to appear before the Circuit
    Court, in November next. It is further stated that one of the
    two magistrates by whom W.S. Bailey was examined, and held to
    bail on this charge, was the chosen leader of the mob that
    destroyed his type and printing press.

    We have yet to see what will be the end of this cruel conflict.
    Let us not desert our suffering friend and his noble-hearted
    family.




LETTERS TO THE WRITER.



    WESTMORELAND TERRACE, December 28, 1860.

    MY ESTEEMED FRIEND:--I received thy touching letter of the 10th
    inst. a few days since, and hasten to assure thee of our
    heart-felt sympathy, and most lively interest in the present
    tremendous state of things around you. At the same time, I
    cannot tell thee how glad and thankful we feel, that with God's
    help thou art determined to persevere and not in any way flinch
    in this day of sore trial. "Be thou faithful unto death, and I
    will give thee a crown of life." "Be strong, fear not." "In the
    fear of the Lord is strong confidence; and his children shall
    have a place of refuge." One thing, too, is sure, "that all
    things will work together for the good" of those who love their
    Lord, that He will never, never forsake them whatever their
    outward trials may be.

    I think, dear friend, thou shouldst be careful not to be about
    alone, particularly in the evening. We heard from W.S. Bailey
    the other day, and he spoke of the advantage of several kind
    friends sticking close to him under recent circumstances at
    Alexandria, when he was exposed to the spite and rage of
    slave-holding bullies. Would it not be well to make a habit, in
    the evening in particular, of you, who are marked men, going
    about in little companies? Wicked men are generally cowards; and
    I think would hesitate more to do a bad act in the presence of
    observers. I think thou wouldst receive a little letter from me
    a day or two after thine was written, through our friend Saml.
    Rhoads, enclosing £7 for the fugitives, £5 for thy own use, and
    £2 for the Vigilance Committee. This letter of mine was sent off
    about the 24th ult., but I conclude was not delivered till just
    after thine was written. It is well to keep us fully informed of
    your circumstances, whether favorable or more appalling. I do
    not intend to put anything of a private character into print;
    but private confidence is the creed in England, and thou needst
    not fear my abusing it. I enclose the only paper that we have
    printed that thou mayest see there was nothing to fear. Thou
    wilt observe there is no reference either to thy own name or to
    Philadelphia, and people here are not very familiar with
    American topography. I am sending W.S. Bailey one of the same
    papers by to-day's mail. We have merely a limited number of them
    printed. I cannot very well obtain money from my friends, (with
    numerous home claims constantly pressing on them), without
    having something to show. Some fugitives are now beginning to
    reach England. A gentleman in London wrote to me, a day or two
    ago, to know if we could find a berth for a fine fellow, who had
    just applied to him. He had arrived by steamer from New York,
    after residing there for three years. A policeman, in the
    street, good-naturedly whispered to him his own name, and then
    that of his masters. He was sure that peril was at hand, and
    that, having been branded for escaping before, he should be
    whipped to death if taken again, so he packed up his little
    wardrobe and embarked for England immediately.

    Another poor fellow is in this town, recently from Charleston,
    whence he escaped, among some cotton bales to Greenock. He is
    getting fair wages in a saw-yard, and likes England very well,
    if it were not for the thought of his poor wife and children
    still in Slavery. We invited him, the other day to a
    working-men's tea party, where I had been asked to make tea for
    them; and he gave us quite an able account of his travels. The
    men kindly invited him to join their "Benefit Club," and told
    him they would like to have "a colored brother" amongst them.

    Art thou not thinking, dear friend, of asking your people to
    emigrate to the African Coast, or the West India Islands? Two
    gentlemen in London are writing most warmly about this. I wrote
    Mr. Fitzgerald's address on the enclosed paper. Instead of being
    colonizationists, in the objectionable sense, he and Mrs. Bowen
    are burning with love to your people, and are fervently desirous
    of doing them all the good they can. I cannot see why little
    united parties should not promptly emigrate under the wing of
    these gentlemen. Assure those who think and feel with thee, dear
    friend, and are nobly determined to suffer rather than to sin,
    that according to our very small ability we will not desert them
    in their hour of trial and danger. We commend them to Him who
    can do for them a thousand times more, and better than we can
    either ask or think. With our united kindest remembrance,

    sincerely,

    Anna H. Richardson.

    Westmoreland Terrace, Newcastle-On-Tyne, March 16,1860.





    We have lately read the life of thy brother and sister (Peter
    and Vina Still), dear friend, with the deepest interest. It is a
    most touching and beautiful book, and we think should be either
    reprinted in England or sent over here very largely. My husband
    and I are hardly acquainted with a volume more calculated to
    stir up the British mind on the subject of Slavery. Great
    Britain is just now getting really warm on the Anti-slavery
    subject, and is longing to shake herself from being so dependent
    as hitherto, on slave produce. Why, Oh! why should not the
    expatriated blacks go to free countries and grow produce for
    themselves and for everybody who requires it? Why not, in time,
    become "merchants and princes," in those countries? I am told
    (as a secret) that this subject is likely, ere long, to be taken
    up in high quarters in England. We are feeling hopeful, dear
    friends, about thy crushed and persecuted people, for surely God
    is working for them by ways and means that we know not. I have
    been careful to keep it to private circles, but thy valuable
    letter of last July, has been read by many with the deepest
    interest. A dear young lady from Dublin is by my side, and has
    but this minute returned it to me. It is but a little, but I
    have gathered £4 by its perusal here and there. I am not able to
    forward so small a sum in this letter, but some way wish to send
    £2 of this amount for thy own use, and the other £2 to your
    Vigilance Committee. It so happens that we have not anything for
    the better from our own Anti-slavery Association this year. Very
    sincerely thy friend, my dear husband uniting in kind regards,

    Anna H. Richardson.

    WOOD HOUSE, near NEWCASTLE, May 3, 1860. [An occasional rural
    residence of ours, five miles from home.]





    To William Still:--I have again to thank thee, dear friend, for
    a kind letter and for the perusal of three letters from thy
    fugitive friends. It must be truly cheering to receive such, and
    their warm and affectionate gratitude must be as rich reward for
    many anxieties. I conclude that it is not necessary for those
    letters to be returned, but should it be so, let me know, and I
    will be on the lookout for some private opportunity of returning
    them to Philadelphia. Such occur now and then. We like to see
    such letters. They assist us to realize the condition of these
    poor wanderers. I am sorry for not having explained myself
    distinctly in my last. The promised £4 were _for the fugitives_,
    being gathered from various Christian friends, who gave it me
    for their particular use. But we wished half of that sum to be
    laid out (as on a previous occasion), at thy own discretion,
    irrespective of the Vigilance Committee. I have now another £1
    to add to the latter half, and would gladly have enclosed a £5
    note in this envelope, but we are rather afraid of sending the
    actual money in letters, and our London bankers do not like to
    remit small sums. I shall continue to watch for the first
    opportunity of forwarding the above.

    Our valued friend, Samuel Rhoads, has been lately in heavy
    sorrow. I send this through his medium, but fear to add more
    lest I should make his letter too heavy. With our united kind
    regards, very truly, thy friend,

    Anna H. Richardson.

    54, Westmoreland Terrace, June 8, 1860.





    Dear Friend:--William Still:--It is a good plan to send me these
    interesting communications. The letter to your coadjutor at
    Elmira, reached us a few days since. That depot must not be
    allowed to go down if it be possible for this to be prevented.
    Perhaps J.W. Jones might be encouraged by a gift from England,
    that is, by a little aid from this country, expressly for the
    fugitives, being put into his hands. If you think so, I am sure
    my friends would approve of this, and you can use your own
    discretion in giving him our gifts in one sum or by detached
    remittances. The greatest part of the money on hand, has come in
    from the private perusal of thy interesting letters, and my
    friends simply gave my husband and me their money for the
    fugitives, leaving the exact disposal of it to our own
    discretion. It has struck me of late, that if I may be allowed
    to print occasional extracts from thy letters (with other
    Anti-slavery information), it would greatly facilitate the
    obtaining of pecuniary aid. As it is, I can lend a private
    letter to a trustworthy friend, but if by any chance, this
    letter got lost, it would be awkward, and it is also impossible,
    of course, to lend the original in two quarters at once. Then,
    again, the mechanical trouble of making copies of letters, is
    not convenient; much sedentary employment does not suit my
    health, and I cannot manage it. I have been thinking of late,
    that if my friends in various parts of the country, could be
    supplied with a small quarto, an occasional printed paper, for
    private circulation, it would save a great deal of trouble, and
    probably bring in considerable aid. My husband and I have long
    been accustomed to preparing tracts and small periodicals for
    the press, so that I think we know exactly what ought to be made
    public and what not. If thou likest to give me this
    discretionary power, do so, and I will endeavor to exercise it
    wisely, and in a way that I feel almost certain would be in
    accordance with thy wishes.

    The sum now remitted through our friend, Samuel Rhoads, is £8
    (eight pounds). Of this, we should like £3 to be placed at thy
    own discretion, for the benefit of the fugitives, £3 (if you
    approve it) in a similar way, to be handed to J.W. Jones, and £2
    as formerly, to be handed to the Philadelphia Vigilance
    Committee. The latter is not, however, as in past times, from
    the Newcastle Anti-slavery Society, for, I am sorry to say, it
    is not a sufficiently pains-taking and executive little body,
    but more apt to work by fits and starts, but from our private
    friends, who kindly place their money in our hands as their
    Anti-slavery stewards. My friend S.R. will therefore kindly hand
    for us: £3 for William Still, for fugitives; £3 for J.W. Jones,
    for fugitives; £2 for Philadelphia Vigilance Committee, for
    fugitives.  Total £8.

    We are very sorry for thee to have to incur so much persecution.
    Be of good cheer, the right will eventually triumph, if not in
    this world, in that day, when all shall be eventually righted on
    our Lord's right hand. Oh, for ability in the meantime, to love
    Him, trust Him, confide in Him implicitly!

    Many thanks for the "Anti-slavery Standards." No one in this
    town, takes them in, consequently we only see them occasionally.
    Do any tidings reach you of our friend, Frederick Douglass? We
    heard from him from Portland, but are anxiously looking for
    another letter. He always spoke of thee, my friend, very kindly,
    and one day, when some money had been given to him for
    fugitives, said: "You shall have part of this if you like, for
    William Still," but I said, "No, I will try and get some
    elsewhere for him." Douglass left us in April, after losing his
    little Annie, but wished his visit to be kept private, and hoped
    to be able to return to England in August. My husband and I
    agree with F.D. in political matters. We are not disunionists,
    but want to mend your corrupted government. With kind regards,
    sincerely thy friend, A.H.R.

    We are well acquainted with William and Ellen Craft. They have
    just sent us their little book.

    W. STILL:--DEAR FRIEND:--That poor fellow, who was so long
    secreted, had been often in my thoughts, when laying this case
    of the fugitives before our friends. I should like thee to feel
    at liberty to replace the remainder of the twenty-five dollars
    from the accompanying ten pounds, which I have much pleasure in
    forwarding, but think it better to mention, that it may perhaps
    be the last remittance for some little time from this quarter,
    as I do not at present see any immediate opening for getting
    more. Our worthy friend, W.S. Bailey, has lately been here, and
    Dr. Cheever and W.H. Day, are expected in a week or two. From
    London too, there are very earnest appeals to assist the
    "African Anti-slavery Society." Thank thee for the newspapers
    and thy last kind note. I think thou rather overrates my little
    services. What a crisis is coming! O, what will the end be? With
    our united best wishes, thy sincere friend,

    ANNA H. RICHARDSON.

    £7 of this money is from some personally unknown friend at
    Lancaster; £5 from two nice little children of my acquaintance.

    54 WESTMORELAND TERRACE,





    NEWCASTLE-ON-TYNE, Oct. 10, 1862.

    I have pleasure, dear friend, in sending you £5 for your
    "contrabands," in response to your last letter of the 17th ult.
    It is not much, but may be a little help. It will be forwarded
    by our valued and mutual friend, H.H. Garnet, to whom I am
    sending a remittance for his "contrabands," by the same mail.

    We shall be interested in any particulars you may like to send
    us, of these poor creatures, but at the same time, I dare not
    hold out any hopes of considerable assistance from England, for
    our own manufacturing districts are in a starving state, from
    the absence of the accustomed supply of cotton, and till this
    has been grown in other quarters, they will continue to have a
    strong claim on every thoughtful mind. Some of us would rather
    work with your colored people _in your own cause_, than with any
    one else, for we _do not like the war_, and do not at all
    approve of "the American churches" committing themselves to it
    so fearfully. If your President had but taken the step at first,
    he is taking now, what rivers of blood might have been stayed!
    It is remarkable, how you, as a people, have been preserved to
    each other, without having your own hands stained with blood.
    But as to expatriation, the very thought of it is foolish. You
    have been brought to America, not emigrated to it, and who on
    earth has any possible right to send you away? Some of us are
    almost as much displeased with the North, for talking of this,
    as with the South for holding you in Slavery. What can we say to
    you, but "watch and pray," "hope and wait," and surely, in His
    own good time, the Most High will make you a pathway out of
    trouble. We are delighted to hear of the good behaviour of your
    people, wherever they have a fair chance of acting (on the
    borders), as upright men and Christians.

    Very sincerely, your friend,

    To WILLIAM STILL. ANNA H. RICHARDSON.




WOMAN ESCAPING IN A BOX, 1857.


SHE WAS SPEECHLESS.


In the winter of 1857 a young woman, who had just turned her majority,
was boxed up in Baltimore by one who stood to her in the relation of a
companion, a young man, who had the box conveyed as freight to the depot
in Baltimore, consigned to Philadelphia. Nearly all one night it
remained at the depot with the living agony in it, and after being
turned upside down more than once, the next day about ten o'clock it
reached Philadelphia. Her companion coming on in advance of the box,
arranged with a hackman, George Custus, to attend to having it brought
from the depot to a designated house, Mrs. Myers', 412 S. 7th street,
where the resurrection was to take place.

Custus, without knowing exactly what the box contained, but suspecting
from the apparent anxiety and instructions of the young man who engaged
him to go after it, that it was of great importance, while the freight
car still remained on the street, demanded it of the freight agent, not
willing to wait the usual time for the delivery of freight. At first the
freight agent declined delivering under such circumstances. The hackman
insisted by saying that he wished to despatch it in great haste, said it
is all right, you know me, I have been coming here for many years every
day, and will be responsible for it. The freight-master told him to
"take it and go ahead with it." No sooner said than done. It was placed
in a one horse wagon at the instance of Custus, and driven to Seventh
and Minster streets.

The secret had been intrusted to Mrs. M. by the young companion of the
woman. A feeling of horror came over the aged woman, who had been thus
suddenly entrusted with such responsibility. A few doors from her lived
an old friend of the same religious faith with herself, well known as a
brave woman, and a friend of the slave, Mrs. Ash, the undertaker or
shrouder, whom every body knew among the colored people. Mrs. Myers felt
that it would not be wise to move in the matter of this resurrection
without the presence of the undertaker. Accordingly, she called Mrs. Ash
in. Even her own family was excluded from witnessing the scene. The two
aged women chose to be alone in that fearful moment, shuddering at the
thought that a corpse might meet their gaze instead of a living
creature. However, they mustered courage and pried off the lid. A woman
was discovered in the straw but no sign of life was perceptible. Their
fears seemed fulfilled. "Surely she is dead," thought the witnesses.

"Get up, my child," spake one of the women. With scarcely life enough to
move the straw covering, she, nevertheless, did now show signs of life,
but to a very faint degree. She could not speak, but being assisted
arose. She was straightway aided up stairs, not yet uttering a word.
After a short while she said, "I feel so deadly weak." She was then
asked if she would not have some water or nourishment, which she
declined. Before a great while, however, she was prevailed upon to take
a cup of tea. She then went to bed, and there remained all day, speaking
but a very little during that time. The second day she gained strength
and was able to talk much better, but not with ease. The third day she
began to come to herself and talk quite freely. She tried to describe
her sufferings and fears while in the box, but in vain. In the midst of
her severest agonies her chief fear was, that she would be discovered
and carried back to Slavery. She had a pair of scissors with her, and in
order to procure fresh air she had made a hole in the box, but it was
very slight. How she ever managed to breathe and maintain her existence,
being in the condition of becoming a mother, it was hard to comprehend.
In this instance the utmost endurance was put to the test. She was
obviously nearer death than Henry Box Brown, or any of the other box or
chest cases that ever came under the notice of the Committee.

In Baltimore she belonged to a wealthy and fashionable family, and had
been a seamstress and ladies' servant generally. On one occasion when
sent of an errand for certain articles in order to complete arrangements
for the Grand Opening Ball at the Academy of Music, she took occasion
not to return, but was among the missing. Great search was made, and a
large reward offered, but all to no purpose. A free colored woman, who
washed for the family, was suspected of knowing something of her going,
but they failing to get aught out of her, she was discharged.

Soon after the arrival of this traveler at Mrs. Myers' the Committee was
sent for and learned the facts as above stated. After spending some
three or four days in Mrs. Myers' family she remained in the writer's
family about the same length of time, and was then forwarded to Canada.

Mrs. Myers was originally from Baltimore, and had frequently been in the
habit of receiving Underground Rail Road passengers; she had always
found Thomas Shipley, the faithful philanthropist, a present help in
time of need. The young man well knew Mrs. Myers would act with prudence
in taking his companion to her house.

George Custus, the hackman, a colored man, was cool, sensible, and
reliable in the discharge of his duty, as were the other parties,
therefore every thing was well managed.

With this interesting case our narratives end, except such facts of a
like kind as may be connected with some of the sketches of stockholders.
A large number on the record book must be omitted. This is partly owing
to the fact that during the first few years of our connection with the
Underground Rail Road, so little was written out in the way of
narratives, that would hardly be of sufficient interest to publish; and
partly from the fact that, although there are exceptional cases even
among those so omitted, that would be equally as interesting as many
which have been inserted, time and space will not admit of further
encroachment. If in any way we have erred in the task of furnishing
facts and important information touching the Underground Rail Road, it
has not been in overstating the sufferings, trials, perils, and
marvellous escapes of those described, but on the contrary. In many
instances after hearing the most painful narratives we had neither time
nor inclination to write them out, except in the briefest manner, simply
sufficient to identify parties, which we did, not dreaming that the dark
cloud of Slavery was so soon to give way to the bright sunlight of
Freedom.



ORGANIZATION OF THE VIGILANCE COMMITTEE.


MEETING TO FORM A VIGILANCE COMMITTEE.


As has already been intimated, others besides the Committee were deeply
interested in The Road; indeed, the little aid actually rendered by the
Committee, was comparatively insignificant, compared with the aid
rendered by some who were not nominally members. To this latter class of
friends, it seems meet that we should particularly allude. Before doing
so, however, simple justice to all concerned, dictates that we should
here copy the official proceedings of the first meeting and organization
of the Philadelphia Vigilance Committee as it existed until the very day
that the ever to be remembered Emancipation Proclamation of Abraham
Lincoln, rendered the services of the organization and road no longer
necessary. It reads as follows:


    "PENNSYLVANIA FREEMAN," December 9, 1852.

    Pursuant to the motion published in last week's "Freeman," a
    meeting was held in the Anti-slavery rooms, on the evening of
    the 2d inst., for the purpose of organizing a Vigilance
    Committee.

    On motion Samuel Nickless was appointed chairman, and William
    Still secretary. J.M. McKim then stated at some length, the
    object of the meeting. He said, that the friends of the fugitive
    slave had been for some years past, embarrassed, for the want of
    a properly constructed active, Vigilance Committee; that the old
    Committee, which used to render effective service in this field
    of Anti-slavery labor, had become disorganized and scattered,
    and that for the last two or three years, the duties of this
    department had been performed by individuals on their own
    responsibility, and sometimes in a very irregular manner; that
    this had been the cause of much dissatisfaction and complaint,
    and that the necessity for a remedy of this state of things was
    generally felt. Hence, the call for this meeting. It was
    intended now to organize a committee, which should be composed
    of persons of known responsibility, and who could be relied upon
    to act systematically and promptly, and with the least possible
    expenditure of money in all cases that might require their
    attention.

    James Mott and Samuel Nickless, expressed their hearty
    concurrence in what had been said, as did also B.N. Goines and
    N.W. Depee. The opinion was also expressed by one or more of
    these gentlemen, that the organization to be formed should be of
    the simplest possible character; with no more machinery or
    officers than might be necessary to hold it together and keep it
    in proper working order. After some discussion, it was agreed
    first to form a general committee, with a chairman, whose
    business it should be to call meetings when necessity should
    seem to require it, and to preside at the same; and a treasurer
    to take charge of the funds; and second, to appoint out of this
    general committee, an acting committee of four persons, who
    should have the responsibility of attending to every case that
    might require their aid, as well as the exclusive authority to
    raise the funds necessary for their purpose. It was further
    agreed that it should be the duty of the chairman of the Acting
    Committee to keep a record of all their doings, and especially
    of the money received and expended on behalf of every case
    claiming their interposition.

    The following persons were appointed on the General Vigilance
    Committee:



    GENERAL VIGILANCE COMMITTEE.



    Robert Purvis,
    William Still,

    Charles H. Bustill,
    P. Williamson,

    Samuel Nickless,
    B.N. Goines,

    Morris Hall,
    J.M. M'Kim,

    Nathaniel Depee,
    Isaiah O. Wears,

    Charles Wise,
    John D. Oliver,

    Jacob C. White,
    Prof. C.L. Reason,

    Cyrus Whitson,
    Henry Gordon,

    J. Asher,
    W.H. Riley,

    J.P. Burr,


    Robert Purvis was understood to be Chairman of the General
    Committee, having been nominated at the head of the list, and
    Charles Wise was appointed treasurer. The Acting Committee was
    thus constituted:

    William Still, chairman, N.W. Depee, Passmore Williamson, J.C.
    White. This Committee was appointed for the term of one year.

    On motion, the proceedings of this meeting were ordered to be
    published in the "Pennsylvania Freeman."

    (Adjourned.)

    William Still, Secretary. Samuel Nickless, Chairman.


The Committee having been thus organized, J.M. McKim, corresponding
secretary and general agent of the Pennsylvania Anti-slavery Society,
issued the subjoined notice, which was published shortly afterwards in
the "Pennsylvania Freeman," and the colored churches throughout the
city:


    "We are pleased to see that we have at last, what has for some
    time been felt to be a desideratum in Philadelphia, a
    responsible and duly authorized Vigilance Committee. The duties
    of this department of Anti-slavery labor, have, for want of such
    an organization, been performed in a very loose and unsystematic
    manner. The names of the persons constituting the Acting
    Committee, are a guarantee that this will not be the case
    hereafter. They are--

    William Still (Chairman), 31 North Fifth Street,

    Nathaniel W. Depee, 334 South Street,

    Jacob C. White, 100 Old York Road, and

    Passmore Williamson, southwest cor. Seventh and Arch Streets.

    We respectfully commend these gentlemen, and the cause in which
    they are engaged, to the confidence and co-operation of all the
    friends of the hunted fugitive. Any funds contributed to either
    of them, or placed in the hands of their Treasurer, Charles
    Wise, corner of Fifth and Market Streets, will be sure of a
    faithful and judicious appropriation."




PORTRAITS AND SKETCHES.




ESTHER MOORE.


For many years no-woman living in Philadelphia was better known to the
colored people of the city generally, than Esther Moore. No woman, white
or colored, living in Philadelphia for the same number of years, left
her home oftener, especially to seek out and aid the weary travelers
escaping from bondage, than did this philanthropist. It is hardly too
much to say that with her own hand she administered to hundreds. She
begged of the Committee, as a special favor, that she might be duly
notified of every fugitive reaching Philadelphia, and actually felt hurt
if from any cause whatever this request was not complied with. For it
was her delight to see the fugitives individually, take them by the hand
and warmly welcome them to freedom. She literally wept with those who
wept, while in tones of peculiar love, sincerity, and firmness, she
lauded them for their noble daring, and freely expressed her entire
sympathy with them, and likewise with all in the prison-house. She
condemned Slavery in all its phases, as a "monster to be loathed as the
enemy of God and man."

Often after listening attentively for hours together to recitals of a
very harrowing nature, especially from females, her mind would seem to
be filled with the sufferings of the slave and it was hard for her to
withdraw from them even when they were on the eve of taking up their
march for a more distant station; and she never thought of parting with
them without showing her faith by her works putting a "gold dollar" in
the hand of each passenger, as she knew that it was not in the power of
the Committee to do much more than defray their expenses to the next
station, to New York sometimes, to Elmira at other times, and now and
then clear through to Canada. She desired that they should have at least
one dollar to fall back upon, independent of the Committee's aid. This
magnanimous rule of giving the gold dollar was adopted by her shortly
after the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law, which daily vexed her
righteous soul, and was kept up as long as she was able to leave her
house, which was within a short time of her death.

Not only did Esther Moore manifest such marked interest in the fugitive
but she likewise took an abiding interest in visiting the colored people
in their religious meetings, schools, and societies, and whenever the
way opened and the Spirit moved her she would take occasion to address
them in the most affectionate manner, in regard to their present and
future welfare, choosing for her theme the subjects of temperance,
education, and slavery. Nor did she mean that her labors in the interest
of the oppressed should cease with her earthly existence, as the
following extracts from her last will and testament will prove:


    2d Item. I give and bequeath to my executors, hereinafter named,
    the sum of Twelve hundred dollars, in trust to invest in ground
    rent, or City of Philadelphia Loans at their disposal or
    discretion to pay the interest or income arising therefrom
    annually. To be applied, the interest of the Twelve hundred
    dollars above mentioned, for educational purposes alone, for
    children of both sexes of color, in Canada, apart from all
    sectarian or traditional dogmas, which is the only hope for the
    rising generation. The application of this money is intended to
    remain perpetual.

    7th Item. I give and bequeath to my executors the sum of one
    hundred dollars, to be expended by them in educating and
    assisting to clothe Phaeton and Pliny J. Lock, the sons of
    Ishmael Lock, deceased, and Matilda Lock (his wife). My will is
    that it shall be given out discretionally by my executors for
    the purpose above mentioned.

    17th Item. I give and bequeath to Oliver Johnson, editor of the
    Pennsylvania Freeman, one hundred dollars, if he be living at my
    death; if not living, to go with the remainder of my estate. My
    will is that if Oliver Johnson be not living at my death his
    bequest go with my estate.

    18th Item. I give and bequeath to Cyrus Burleigh, lecturer and
    agent for the Pennsylvania Anti-slavery Society, one hundred
    dollars, if Cyrus be living at my death. If not living at my
    death, his bequest, Cyrus Burleigh's, I wish to go with the
    residue of my estate. The untiring vigilance of these two young
    men, in devoting the best of their days to the rescue and
    emancipation of the poor and down-trodden fugitives has obtained
    for them a warm place in my heart. And may heaven's richest
    blessings reward them. They have ministered more than "the cup
    of water."

    Item 19th. I give and bequeath unto the Association for the care
    of Colored Orphans of Philadelphia, called the Shelter for the
    use and benefit of colored orphans of both sexes, to be paid
    into the hands of the treasurer for the time being, for the use
    of said Society all the rest and remainder of my estate.

    I wish my Executors or Trustees _to carry out_ my views in
    regard to the education of colored children in Canada, by paying
    over the interest arising annually from the twelve hundred
    dollars mentioned in the second item to such school or schools
    as in their judgment they may deem best. My desire being the
    benefit of such children who may be in the same neighborhood
    with them. The interest arising from the twelve hundred dollars
    mentioned in second item for the purpose of educating colored
    children in Canada is intended to remain perpetual.


           *       *       *       *       *


    I give and bequeath to William Still, of Philadelphia, now
    employed in the Anti-slavery office, in Fifth St., Philadelphia,
    February 21, the sum of one hundred dollars; and request my
    executors and trustees to pay over that amount out of my estate.


Esther Moore was not rich in this world's goods, but was purely
benevolent and rich in good works towards her fellow-men, hating every
form of oppression and injustice, and an uncompromising witness against
prejudice on account of color. Such a friend as was Esther Moore during
these many dark years of kidnapping, slave-catching, mob violence, and
bitter prejudice which the colored people were wont to encounter, should
never be forgotten.

The legacy devised for educational purposes was applied in due time,
after one of the executors in company with his wife, Dr. J. Wilson and
Rachel Barker Moore, visited the various settlements of fugitives in
Canada, expressly with a view of finding out where the fund would do the
most good, in accordance with the testator's wishes. And although the
testator has been dead seventeen years, her legacy is still doing its
mission in her name, in a school, near Chatham, Canada West.

In order to complete this sketch, it is only necessary that we should
copy the beautiful and just tribute to her memory, written by Oliver
Johnson, editor of the "National Anti-slavery Standard," and published
in the columns thereof, as follows:


    DEATH OF A NOBLE WOMAN.

    [From the "National Anti-Slavery Standard."]

    Just as our paper is going to press, there comes to us
    intelligence of the death of our beloved and revered friend,
    Esther Moore, widow of the late Dr. Robert Moore, of
    Philadelphia. She expired on Tuesday morning, November 21st,
    1854, of gout of the heart, after a short, but painful illness,
    in the eightieth year of her age.

    The writer of this first became acquainted with her in 1836,
    and, at various times since then, has met her at Anti-slavery
    meetings, or in familiar intercourse at her own house. Her most
    remarkable traits of character were an intense hatred of
    oppression in all its forms, a corresponding love for the
    oppressed, an untiring devotion to their welfare, and a courage
    that never quailed before any obstacles, however formidable. Her
    zeal in behalf of the Anti-slavery cause, and especially in
    behalf of the fugitive, a zeal that absorbed all the powers of
    her noble nature, was a perpetual rebuke to the comparative
    coldness and indifference of those around her. We well remember
    how her soul was fired with a righteous indignation when upwards
    of thirty innocent persons, most of them colored people, were
    thrown into prison at Philadelphia, upon a charge of treason,
    for their alleged participation in the tragedy at Christiana.
    Day after day did she visit the prisoners in their cells, to
    minister to their wants, and cheer them in their sorrow; and
    during the progress of Hanway's trial, her constant presence in
    the court-room, and her frequent interviews with the District
    Attorney, attested her deep anxiety as to the result of the
    impending struggle. When we last saw her, about a month since,
    she was engaged in collecting a large sum of money to ransom a
    family of slaves, whose peculiar condition had enlisted her
    deepest sympathy. Notwithstanding her age and infirmities, she
    had enlisted in this work with a zeal which, even in a younger
    person, would have been remarkable. For many days, perhaps for
    many weeks, she went from door to door, asking for the means
    whereby to secure the freedom and the happiness of an enslaved
    and plundered household.

    As a member of the Society of Friends, she lamented the guilty
    supineness of that body, in regard to the question of Slavery,
    and often, in its meetings, as well as in private intercourse,
    felt herself constrained to utter the language of expostulation
    and rebuke. In this, as in other relations of life, she was
    obedient to the revelation of God in her own soul, and a worthy
    example of fidelity to her convictions of duty. Her step-son, J.
    Wilson Moore, in a letter to us announcing her decease, says:

    Among the last injunctions she gave, was, "Write to Oliver
    Johnson, and tell him I die firm in the faith! MIND THE SLAVE!"
    She had enjoyed excellent health the last few years, and
    continued actively engaged in works of benevolence. During the
    last few weeks, she had devoted much time and labor to the
    collection of funds for the liberation of ten slaves in North
    Carolina, who had been promised their freedom at a comparatively
    small amount. Notwithstanding her great bodily suffering, her
    mind was clear to the last, expressing her full assurance of
    Divine approbation in the course she had taken.

    This is all that we can now say of the life of our revered and
    never-to-be-forgotten friend. Perhaps some one who knew her more
    intimately than we did, and who is better acquainted with the
    history of her life and labors, will furnish us with a more
    complete sketch. If so, we shall publish it with great
    satisfaction.

    Happy! ay, happy! let her ashes rest; Her heart was honest, and
    she did her best; In storm and darkness, evil and dismay, The
    star of duty was her guiding ray.


Her injunction to "MIND THE SLAVE," comes to us as the dying admonition
of one, whose life was a beautiful exemplification of the duty and the
privilege thus enjoined. It imposes, indeed, no new obligation; but
coming from such a source, it will linger in our memory while life and
its scenes shall last, inspiring in us, we hope, a purer and a more
ardent devotion to the cause of freedom and humanity. And may we not
hope that others also, will catch a new inspiration from the dying
message of our departed friend: "MIND THE SLAVE!"



ABIGAIL GOODWIN.


Contemporary with Esther Moore, and likewise an intimate personal friend
of hers, Abigail Goodwin, of Salem, N.J., was one of the rare, true
friends to the Underground Rail Road, whose labors entitle her name to
be mentioned in terms of very high praise.

A.W.M. a most worthy lady, in a letter to a friend, refers to her in the
following language:

"From my long residence under the same roof, I learned to know well her
uncommon self-sacrifice of character, and to be willing and glad,
whenever in my power, to honor her memory. But, yet I should not know
what further to say about her than to give a very few words of testimony
to her life of ceaseless and active benevolence, especially toward the
colored people.

"Her life outwardly was wholly uneventful; as she lived out her whole
life of seventy-three years in the neighborhood of her birth-place."

With regard to her portrait, which was solicited for this volume, the
same lady thus writes: "No friend of hers would for a moment think of
permitting that miserable caricature, the only picture existing meant to
represent her, to be given to the public. I cannot even bear to give a
place in my little album to so mournful and ridiculous a
misrepresentation of her in face."


       *       *       *       *       *


"You wonder why her sister, E., my loved and faithful friend, seems to
be so much less known among anti-slavery people than Abbie? One reason
is, that although dear Betsy's interest in the subject was quite equal
in _earnestness_, it was not quite so absorbingly _exclusive_. Betsy
economized greatly in order to give to the cause, but Abby denied
herself even _necessary apparel_, and Betsy has often said that few
beggars came to our doors whose garments were so worn, forlorn, and
patched-up as Abby's. Giving to the colored people was a perfect
_passion_ with her; consequently she was known as a larger giver than
Betsy.

"Another and greater reason why she was more known abroad than her
sister E., was that she wrote with facility, and corresponded at
intervals with many on these matters, Mr. McKim and others, and for many
years."


       *       *       *       *       *


Abigail was emphatically of the type of the poor widow, who cast in all
her living. She worked for the slave as a mother would work for her
children. Her highest happiness aad pleasure in life seemed to be
derived from rendering acts of kindness to the oppressed. Letters of
sympathy accompanied with bags of stockings, clothing, and donations of
money were not unfrequent from her.

New Jersey contained a few well-tried friends, both within and without
the Society of Friends, to which Miss Goodwin belonged; but among them
all none was found to manifest, at least in the Underground Rail Road of
Philadelphia, such an abiding interest as a co-worker in the cause, as
did Abigail Goodwin.

The sympathy which characterized her actions is clearly evinced in her
own words, as contained in the appended extracts from her letter, as
follows:


    "DEAR FRIEND:--I sent E.M. (Esther Moore) forty-one dollars more
    by half than I expected to when I set about it. I expect that
    abolitionists there are all opposed to buying slaves, and will
    not give anything. I don't like buying them, or giving money to
    slave-holders either; but this seems to be a peculiar case, can
    be had so cheap, and so many young ones that would be separated
    from their parents; slavery is peculiarly hard for children,
    that cannot do anything to protect themselves, nor can their
    parents, and the old too, it is hard for them; but it is a
    terrible thing altogether. The case of the fugitive thee
    mentioned was indeed truly affecting; it makes one ashamed as
    well as sad to read such things, that human beings, or any other
    beings should be so treated. I cannot but hope and believe that
    slavery will ere long cease. I have a strong impression that the
    colored people and the women are to have a day of prosperity and
    triumph over their oppressors. We must patiently wait and
    quietly hope; but not keep too much 'in the quiet.' Shall have
    to work our deliverance from bondage. 'Who would be free,
    themselves must strike the blow.'

    "I regret very much that I have not more clothing to send than
    the stockings. I have not had time since I thought of it, to
    make anything; am ashamed that I was so inconsiderate of the
    poor runaways. I will go to work as soon as I have earned money
    to buy materials; have managed so as to spend my little annual
    allowance in nine months, and shall not be able to give you any
    money for some months, but if more stockings are wanted let me
    know, our benevolent society have plenty on hand; and I have
    some credit if not money; they will trust me till I have; they
    furnish work for poor women and sell it. I get them for fifty
    cents a pair.

    "My sister says Lucretia (Mott) told her that there was not much
    clothing in the trunk, only a few old things. I think she told
    me there was nothing in it, she meant, I suppose, of any
    consequence.  *  *  *

    "I should like to know if the fugitives are mostly large. I have
    an idea they are generally small in stature; that slavery stunts
    the body as well as mind. I want to know in regard to the
    clothes that I intend making; it's best to have them fit as well
    as can be. I shall work pretty much for women. I hope and expect
    there are many friends of the cause who furnish clothing in the
    city. They ought to be fitted out for Canada with strong, warm
    clothing in cold weather, and their sad fate alleviated as much
    as can be."



       *       *       *       *       *


The forty-one dollars, referred to in the above letter, and sent to
"E.M." was to go especially towards buying an interesting family of ten
slaves, who were owned in North Carolina by a slave-holder, whose rare
liberality was signalized by offering to take $1,000 for the lot, young
and old. In this exceptional case, while opposed to buying slaves, in
common with abolitionists generally, she was too tender-hearted to
resist the temptation so long as "they could be bought so cheap."

To rid men of their yoke was her chief desire. Such was her habit of
making the sad lot of a slave a personal matter; that let her view him,
in any light whatever, whether in relation to young ones that would be
separated from their parents, or with regard to the old, the life of a
slave was "peculiarly hard," "a terrible thing" in her judgment.

The longer she lived, and the more faithfully she labored for the
slave's deliverance, the more firmly she became rooted in the
soul-encouraging idea, that "Slavery will ere long cease." Whilst the
great masses were either blind, or indifferent, she was nerved by this
faith to bear cheerfully all the sacrifices she was called on to make.
From another letter we copy as follows:


    JANUARY 25th, 1855.

    DEAR FRIEND:--The enclosed ten dollars I have made, earned in
    two weeks, and of course it belongs to the slave. It may go for
    the fugitives, or Carolina slaves, whichever needs it most. I am
    sorry the fugitives' treasury is not better supplied, if money
    could flow into it as it does into the Tract Fund; but that is
    not to be expected.

    Thy answer in regard to impostors is quite satisfactory. No
    doubt you take great pains to arrive at the truth, but cannot at
    all times avoid being imposed on. Will that little boy of seven
    years have to travel on foot to Canada? There will be no safety
    for him here. I hope his father will get off. John Hill writes
    very well, considering his few advantages. If plenty of good
    schools could be established in Canada for the benefit of
    fugitives, many bright scholars and useful citizens would be
    added to society. I hope these will be in process of time.

    It takes the most energetic and intelligent to make their way
    out of bondage from the most Southern States. It is rather a
    wonder to me that so many can escape, the masters are so
    continually watching them. The poor man that secreted himself so
    long, must, indeed, have suffered dreadfully, and been
    exceedingly resolute to brave dangers so long.


It was so characteristic of her to take an interest in everything that
pertained to the Underground Rail Road, that even the deliverance of a
little nameless boy was not beneath her notice. To her mind, his freedom
was just as dear to him as if he had been the son of the President of
the United States.

How they got on in Canada, and the question of education, were matters
that concerned her deeply; hence, occasional letters received from
Canada, evincing marked progress, such as the hero John H. Hill was in
the habit of writing, always gave her much pleasure to peruse.

In the Wheeler slave-case, in which Passmore Williamson and others were
engaged, her interest was very great. From a letter dated Salem,
September 9, 1855, we quote the subjoined extract:


    DEAR FRIEND:--I am truly rejoiced and thankful that the right
    has triumphed. But stranger had it been otherwise, in your
    intelligent community, where it must be apparent to all who
    inquire into it, that you had done nothing but what was
    deserving of high commendation, instead of blame and punishment;
    and shame on the jury who would bring in the two men guilty of
    assault and battery. They ought to have another trial; perhaps
    another jury would be more just. It is well for the credit of
    Philadelphia, that there is one upright judge, as Kelley seems
    to be, and his sentence will be a light one it is presumed,
    showing he considered the charge a mere pretence.

    I hope and trust, that neither thyself nor the other men will
    have much if any of the expense to bear; your lawyers will not
    charge anything I suppose, and the good citizens will pay all
    else. It seems there are hopes entertained that Passmore
    Williamson will soon be set at liberty. It must be a great
    comfort to him and wife, in their trials, that it will conduce
    to the furtherance of the good cause.

    If Philadelphians are not aroused now after this great stretch
    of power, to consider their safety, they must be a stupid set of
    people, but it must certainly do good.  *  *  *  You will take
    good care of Jane Johnson, I hope, and not let her get kidnapped
    back to Slavery. Is it safe for her to remain in your city or
    anywhere else in our "free land?" I have some doubts and fears
    for her; do try to impress her with the necessity of being very
    cautious and careful against deceivers, pretended friends. She
    had better be off to Canada pretty soon.

    Thy wife must not sit up washing and ironing all night again.
    She ought to have help in her sympathy and labors for the poor
    fugitives, and, I should think there are many there who would
    willingly assist her.

    I intended to be careful of trespassing upon thy time, as thee
    must have enough to do; the fugitives are still coming I expect.
    With kind regards, also to thy wife, your friend,

    A. GOODWIN.


In another letter, she suggests the idea of getting up a committee of
women to provide clothing for fugitive females; on this point she wrote
thus:


    "SALEM, 8th mo., 1st.

    "Would it not be well to get up a committee of women, to provide
    clothes for fugitive females--a dozen women sewing a day, or
    even half a day of each week, might keep a supply always ready,
    they might, I should think, get the merchants or some of them,
    to give cheap materials--mention it to thy wife, and see if she
    cannot get up a society. I will do what I can here for it. I
    enclose five dollars for the use of fugitives. It was a good
    while that I heard nothing of your rail road concerns; I
    expected thee had gone to Canada, or has the journey not been
    made, or is it yet to be accomplished, or given up? I was in
    hopes thee would go and see with thy own eyes, how things go on
    in that region of fugitives, and if it's a goodly land to live
    in.

    "This is the first of August, and I suppose you are celebrating
    it in Philadelphia, or some of you are, though I believe you are
    not quite as zealous as the Bostonians are in doing it. When
    will our first of August come? oh, that it might be soon, very
    soon! ... It's high time the 'reign of oppression was over.'"


Ever alive to the work, she would appeal to such as were able among her
friends, to take stock in the Underground Rail Road, and would sometimes
succeed. In a letter dated July 30, 1856, she thus alludes to her
efforts:


    "I have tried to beg something for them, but have not got much;
    one of our neighbors, S.W. Acton, gave me three dollars for
    them; I added enough to make ten, which thee will find inside. I
    shall owe three more, to make my ten. I presume they are still
    coming every day almost, and I fear it comes rather hard on thee
    and wife to do for so many; but you no doubt feel it a
    satisfaction to do all you can for the poor sufferers."


February 10, 1858, she forwarded her willing contribution, with the
following interesting remarks:


    SALEM, February 10, 1858.

    DEAR FRIEND:--Thee will find enclosed, five dollars for the
    fugitives, a little for so many to share it, but better than
    nothing; oh, that people, rich people, would remember them
    instead of spending so much on themselves; and those too, who
    are not called rich, might, if there was only a willing mind,
    give too of their abundance; how can they forbear to sympathize
    with those poor destitute ones--but so it is--there is not half
    the feeling for them there ought to be, indeed scarcely anybody
    seems to think about them. "Inasmuch as ye have _not_ done it
    unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have not done it
    unto me."

    Thy friend,

    A. GOODWIN.


When the long looked-for day of emancipation arrived, which she had
never expected to witness, the unbounded thankfulness of her heart found
expression in the appended letter:


    SALEM, September 23, 1862.

    DEAR FRIEND:--Thy letter dated 17th, was not received till last
    night. I cannot tell where it has been detained so long. On the
    22d, yesterday, Amy Reckless came here, after I began writing,
    and wished me to defer sending for a day or two, thinking she
    could get a few more dollars, and she has just brought some, and
    will try for more, and clothing. A thousand thanks to President
    Hamlin for his kindness to the contrabands; poor people! how
    deplorable their situation; where will they go to, when cold
    weather comes? so many of them to find homes for, but they must
    and will, I trust be taken care of, not by their former
    care-takers though.

    I have read the President's proclamation of emancipation, with
    thankfulness and rejoicing; but upon a little reflection, I did
    not feel quite satisfied with it; three months seems a long time
    to be in the power of their angry and cruel masters, who, no
    doubt, will wreak all their fury and vengeance upon them,
    killing and abusing them in every way they can--and sell them to
    Cuba if they can. It makes me sad to think of it. Slavery, I
    fear, will be a long time in dying, after receiving the fatal
    stroke. What do abolitionists think of it? and what is thy
    opinion? I feel quite anxious to know something more about it.
    The "Daily Press" says, it will end the war and its cause. How
    can we be thankful enough if it should, and soon too. "Oh,
    praise and tanks," what a blessing for our country. I never
    expected to see the happy day. If thee answers this, thee will
    please tell me all about it, and what is thought of it by the
    wise ones; but I ought not to intrude on thy time, thee has so
    much on thy hands, nor ask thee to write. I shall know in time,
    if I can be patient to wait.

    Enclosed are seventeen dollars; from Amy Reckless, $1,50; J.
    Bassett, $1; Jesse Bond, $1; Martha Reeve, $1; S. Woodnutt, $1;
    Hannah Wheeler, $1; a colored man, 25 cents; 25 cents thrown in,
    to make even; A.G., $10. Amy is very good in helping, and is
    collecting clothing, which she thinks, cannot be sent till next
    week. I will attend to sending it, as soon as can be, by stage
    driver. May every success attend thy labors for the poor
    sufferers.  *  *  *

    With kind regards, thy friend,

    A. GOODWIN.


Thus, until the last fetter was broken, with singular persistency, zeal,
faith and labor, she did what she could to aid the slave, without hope
of reward in this world. Not only did she contribute to aid the
fugitives, but was, for years, a regular and liberal contributor to the
Pennsylvania Anti-slavery Society, as well as a subscriber to the
Anti-slavery papers, The "Liberator," "National Anti-Slavery Standard,"
"Pennsylvania Freeman," etc.

Having seen with joy, the desire of her heart, in the final emancipation
of every bondman in the United States, she departed in peace, November
2, 1867, in the 74th year of her age.



FAITHFUL WORKERS IN THE CAUSE.

THOMAS GARRETT.


The recent death of Thomas Garrett, called forth from the press, as well
as from abolitionists and personal friends, such universal expressions
of respect for his labors as a philanthropist, and especially as an
unswerving friend of the Underground Rail Road, that we need only
reproduce selections therefrom, in order to commemorate his noble deeds
in these pages.

From the "Wilmington Daily Commercial," published by Jenkins and
Atkinson (men fully inspired with the spirit of impartial freedom), we
copy the following notice, which is regarded by his relatives and
intimate anti-slavery friends as a faithful portraiture of his character
and labors:


    Thomas Garrett, who died full of years and honor, this morning,
    at the ripe age of eighty-one, was a man of no common character.
    He was an abolitionist from his youth up, and though the grand
    old cause numbered amongst its supporters, poets, sages, and
    statesmen, it had no more faithful worker in its ranks than
    Thomas Garrett.

    He has been suffering for several years, from a disease of the
    bladder, which frequently caused him most acute anguish, and
    several times threatened his life. The severe pain attending the
    disease, and the frequent surgical operations it rendered
    necessary, undermined his naturally strong constitution, so that
    when he was prostrated by his last illness, grave fears were
    entertained of a fatal result. He continued in the possession of
    his faculties to the last, and frequently expressed his entire
    willingness to die.

    Yesterday he was found to be sinking very rapidly. Just before
    midnight, last night, he commenced to speak, and some of those
    in attendance, went close to his bed-side. He was evidently in
    some pain, and said: "It is all peace, peace, peace, but no rest
    this side of the river." He then breathed calmly on for some
    time. About half an hour later, one of those in attendance
    ceased to hear his breathing, and bending over him, found that
    his soul had fled.

    He retained a good deal of his strength through his illness, and
    was able to get up from his bed, every day, with the assistance
    of one person.

    He will be buried in the Friends' grave-yard, corner of Fourth
    and West Streets, on Saturday next, at three o'clock, P.M., and
    in accordance with a written memorandum of an agreement made by
    him a year ago with them, the colored people will bear him to
    his grave, they having solicited of him that honor.

    He was born of Quaker parents, in Upper Darby, Delaware county,
    Pa., on the 21st of August, 1789, on a farm still in the
    possession of the family. His father, though a farmer, had been
    a scythe and edge-tool maker, and Thomas learned of him the
    trade, and his knowledge of it afterwards proved of the utmost
    advantage to him.

    He grew up and married at Darby, his wife being Sarah Sharpless,
    and in 1820 they came to Wilmington to live, bringing with them
    several children, most of whom still live here.

    Some years after his arrival here, his wife died, and in course
    of time, he again married, his second wife being Rachel
    Mendenhall, who died in April, 1868, beloved and regretted by
    all who knew her.

    His business career was one of vicissitude, but generally and
    ultimately successful, for he made the whole of the comfortable
    competence of which he died possessed, after he was sixty years
    of age. While in the beginning of his business career, as an
    iron merchant in this city, a wealthy rival house attempted to
    crush him, by reducing prices of iron to cost, but Mr. Garrett,
    nothing dismayed, employed another person to attend his store,
    put on his leather apron, took to his anvil, and in the
    prosecution of his trade, as an edge-tool maker, prepared to
    support himself as long as this ruinous rivalry was kept up.
    Thus in the sweat of the brow of one of the heroes and
    philanthropists of this age, was laid the foundation of one of
    the most extensive business houses that our city now boasts. His
    competitor saw that no amount of rivalry could crush a man thus
    self-supporting and gave up the effort.

    Of course, Thomas Garrett is best known for his labors in behalf
    of the abolition of Slavery, and as a practical and effective
    worker for emancipation long before the nation commenced the
    work of liberation and justice.

    Born a Quaker, he held with simple trust, the faith of the
    society that God moves and inspires men to do the work he
    requires of their hands, and throughout his life he never
    wavered in his conviction, that his Father had called him to
    work in the cause to which he devoted himself.

    His attention was first directed to the iniquity of Slavery,
    while he was a young man of twenty-four or twenty five. He
    returned one day to his father's house, after a brief absence,
    and found the family dismayed and indignant at the kidnapping of
    a colored woman in their employ.

    Thomas immediately resolved to follow the kidnappers, and so
    started in pursuit. Some peculiarity about the track made by
    their wagon, enabled him to trace them with ease, and he
    followed them by a devious course, from Darby, to a place near
    the Navy Yard, in Philadelphia, and then by inquiries, etc.,
    tracked them to Kensington, where he found them, and, we
    believe, secured the woman's release.

    During this ride, he afterwards assured his friends, he felt the
    iniquity and abomination of the whole system of Slavery borne in
    upon his mind so strongly, as to fairly appal him, and he seemed
    to hear a voice within him, assuring him that his work in life
    must be to help and defend this persecuted race.

    From this time forward, he never failed to assist any fugitive
    from Slavery on the way to freedom, and, of course, after his
    removal to this city, his opportunities for this were greatly
    increased, and in course of time, his house became known as one
    of the refuges for fugitives. The sentiment of this community
    was, at that time, bitterly averse to any word or effort against
    Slavery, and Mr. Garrett had but half a dozen friends who stood
    by him. Nearly all others looked at him with suspicion, or
    positive aversion, and his house was constantly under the
    surveillance of the police, who then, sad to say, were always on
    the watch for any fugitives from bondage. Thomas was not
    disheartened or dismayed by the lack of popular sympathy or
    approval. He believed the Lord was on his side, and cared
    nothing for the adverse opinion of men.

    Many and interesting stories are told of the men and women he
    helped away, some of them full of pathos, and some decidedly
    amusing. He told the latter which related to his ingenious
    contrivances for assisting fugitives to escape the police with
    much pleasure, in his later years. We would repeat many of them,
    but this is not the time or place. The necessity of avoiding the
    police was the only thing, however, which ever forced him into
    any secrecy in his operations, and in all other respects he was
    "without concealment and without compromise" in his opposition
    to Slavery. He was a man of unusual personal bravery, and of
    powerful physique, and did not present an encouraging object for
    the bullying intimidation by which the pro-slavery men of that
    day generally overawed their opponents. He seems to have
    scarcely known what fear was, and though irate slave-holders
    often called on him to learn the whereabouts of their slaves, he
    met them placidly, never denied having helped the fugitives on
    their way, positively refused to give them any information, and
    when they flourished pistols, or bowie-knives to enforce their
    demands, he calmly pushed the weapons aside, and told them that
    none but cowards resorted to such means to carry their ends.

    He continued his labors, thus, for years, helping all who came
    to him, and making no concealment of his readiness to do so. His
    firmness and courage slowly won others, first to admire, and
    then to assist him, and the little band of faithful workers, of
    which he was chief, gradually enlarged and included in its
    number, men of all ranks, and differing creeds, and, singular as
    it may seem, even numbering some ardent Democrats in its ranks.
    He has, in conversation with the present writer and others,
    frequently acknowledged the valuable services of two Roman
    Catholics, of Irish birth, still living in this city, who were
    ever faithful to him, and will now be amongst those who most
    earnestly mourn his decease.

    His efforts, of course, brought him much persecution and
    annoyance, but never culminated in anything really serious,
    until about the year 1846 or '47.

    He then met, at New Castle, a man, woman, and six children, from
    down on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. The man was free, the
    woman had, been a slave, and while in Slavery had had by her
    husband, two children. She was then set free, and afterwards had
    four children. The whole party ran away. They traveled several
    days, and finally reached Middletown, late at night, where they
    were taken in, fed and cared for, by John Hunn, a wealthy
    Quaker, there. They were watched, however, by some persons in
    that section, who followed them, arrested them, and sent them to
    New Castle to jail. The sheriff and his daughter were
    Anti-slavery people, and wrote to Mr. Garrett to come over. He
    went over, had an interview, found from their statement, that
    four of the party were undoubtedly free, and returned to this
    city. On the following day, he and U.S. Senator Wales, went over
    and had the party taken before Judge Booth, on a writ of _habeas
    corpus_. Judge Booth decided that there was no evidence on which
    to hold them, that in the absence of evidence the _presumption
    was always in favor of freedom_ and discharged them.

    Mr. Garrett then said, here is this woman with a babe at her
    breast, the child suffering from a white swelling on its leg, is
    there any impropriety in my getting a carriage and helping them
    over to Wilmington? Judge Booth responded certainly not.

    Mr. Garrett then hired the carriage, but gave the driver
    distinctly to understand that he only paid for the woman and the
    young children; the rest might walk. They all got in, however,
    and finally escaped, of course the two children born in slavery
    amongst the rest.

    Six weeks afterwards the slave-holders followed them, and
    incited, it is said, by the Cochrans and James A. Bayard,
    commenced a suit against Mr. Garrett, claiming all the fugitives
    as slaves. Mr. Garrett's friends claim that the jury was packed
    to secure an adverse verdict. The trial came on before Chief
    Justice Taney and Judge Hall, in the May term (1848) of the U.S.
    Court, sitting at New Castle, Bayard representing the
    prosecutors, and Wales the defendant. There were four trials in
    all, lasting three days. We have not room here for the details
    of the trial, but the juries awarded even heavier damages than
    the plaintiffs claimed, and the judgments swept away every
    dollar of his property.

    When the trials were concluded, Mr. Garrett arose, the court
    being adjourned, made a speech of an hour to the large crowd in
    the court-room, in the course of which he declared his intention
    to redouble his exertions, so help him God. His bold assertion
    was greeted with mingled cheers and hisses, and at the
    conclusion of his speech one of the jurors who had convicted him
    strode across the benches, grasped his hand, and begged his
    forgivenness.

    Mr. Garrett kept his pledge and redoubled his exertions. The
    trial advertised him, and such was the demand on him for
    shelter, that he was compelled to put another story on his back
    buildings. His friends helped him to start again in business,
    and commencing anew in his sixtieth year with nothing, he again
    amassed a handsome competence, generously contributing all the
    while to every work in behalf of the down-trodden blacks or his
    suffering fellow-men of any color.

    In time the war came, and as he remarked, the nation went into
    the business by the wholesale, so he quit his retail operations,
    having, after he commenced to keep a record, helped off over
    twenty-one hundred slaves, and no inconsiderable number before
    that time.

    In time, too, he came to be honored instead of execrated for his
    noble efforts. Wilmington became an abolition city, and for
    once, at least, a prophet was not without honor in his own city.
    Mr. Garrett continued his interest in every reform up to his
    last illness, and probably his last appearance in any public
    capacity, was as president of a Woman Suffrage meeting, in the
    City Hall, a few months ago, which was addressed by Julia Ward
    Howe, Lucy Stone, and Henry B. Blackwell.

    He lived to see the realization of his hopes for Universal
    Freedom, and in April last on the occasion of the great parade
    of the colored people in this city, he was carried through our
    streets in an open barouche, surrounded by the men in whose
    behalf he had labored so faithfully, and the guards around his
    carriage carrying banners, with the inscription, "Our Moses."

    A Moses he was to their race; but unto him it was given to enter
    into the promised land toward which he had set his face
    persistently and almost alone for more than half a century.

    He was beloved almost to adoration by his dusky-hued friends,
    and in the dark days of the beginning of the war, which every
    Wilmingtonian will remember with a shudder, in those days of
    doubt, confusion, and suspicion, without his knowledge or
    consent, Thomas Garrett's house was constantly surrounded and
    watched by faithful black men, resolved that, come weal come woe
    to them, no harm should come to the benefactor of their race.

    He was a hero in a life-time fight, an upright, honest man in
    his dealings with men, a tender husband, a loving father, and
    above all, a man who loved his neighbor as himself, and
    righteousness and truth better than ease, safety, or worldly
    goods, and who never let any fear of harm to person or property
    sway him from doing his whole duty to the uttermost.

    He was faithful among the faithless, upright and just in the
    midst of a wicked and perverse generation, and lived to see his
    labors rewarded and approved in his own life-time, and then with
    joy that the Right had triumphed by mightier means than his own;
    with thankfulness for the past, and with calm trust for the
    future, he passed to the reward of the just. He has fought a
    good fight, he has finished his course, he has kept the faith.


From the same paper, of January 30th, 1871, we extract an account of the
funeral obsequies which took place on Saturday, January 28th.


    FUNERAL SERVICE ON SATURDAY.

    The funeral of Thomas Garrett, which took place on Saturday,
    partook almost of the character of a popular ovation to the
    memory of the deceased, though it was conducted with the
    plainness of form which characterizes the society of which he
    was a member.

    There was no display, no organization, nothing whatever to
    distinguish this from ordinary funerals, except the outpouring
    of people of every creed, condition, and color, to follow the
    remains to their last resting-place.

    There was for an hour or two before the procession started, a
    constant living stream of humanity passing into the house,
    around the coffin, and out at another door, to take a last look
    at the face of the deceased, the features of which displayed a
    sweetness and serenity which occasioned general remark. A smile
    seemed to play upon the dead lips.

    Shortly after three o'clock the funeral procession started, the
    plain coffin, containing the remains, being carried by the
    stalwart arms of a delegation of colored men, and the family and
    friends of the deceased following in carriages with a large
    procession on foot, while the sidewalks along the line, from the
    house to the meeting-house, more than six squares, were densely
    crowded with spectators.

    The Friends' Meeting House was already crowded, except the place
    reserved for the relatives of the deceased, and, though probably
    fifteen hundred people crowded into the capacious building, a
    greater number still were unable to gain admission.

    The crowd inside was composed of all kinds and conditions of
    men, white and black, all uniting to do honor to the character
    and works of the deceased.

    The coffin was laid in the open space in front of the gallery of
    ministers and elders, and the lid removed from it, after which
    there was a period of silence.

    Presently the venerable Lucretia Mott arose and said that,
    seeing the gathering of the multitude there and thronging along
    the streets, as she had passed on her way to the meeting-house,
    she had thought of the multitude which gathered after the death
    of Jesus, and of the remark of the Centurion, who, seeing the
    people, said: "Certainly this was a righteous man." Looking at
    this multitude she would say surely this also was a righteous
    man. She was not one of those who thought it best always on
    occasions like this, to speak in eulogy of the dead, but this
    was not an ordinary case, and seeing the crowd that had
    gathered, and amongst it the large numbers of a once despised
    and persecuted race, for which the deceased had done so much,
    she felt that it was fit and proper that the good deeds of this
    man's life should be remembered, for the encouragement of
    others. She spoke of her long acquaintance with him, of his
    cheerful and sunny disposition, and his firm devotion to the
    truth as he saw it.

    Aaron M. Powell, of New York, was the next speaker, and he spoke
    at length with great earnestness of the life-long labor of his
    departed friend in the abolition cause, of his cheerfulness, his
    courage, and his perfect consecration to his work.

    He alluded to the fact, that deceased was a member of the
    Society of Friends, and held firmly to its faith that God leads
    and inspires men to do the work He requires of them, that He
    speaks within the soul of every man, and that all men are
    equally His children, subject to His guidance, and that all
    should be free to follow wherever the Spirit might lead. It was
    Thomas Garrett's recognition of this sentiment that made him an
    abolitionist, and inspired him with the courage to pursue his
    great work. He cared little for the minor details of Quakerism,
    but he was a true Quaker in his devotion to this great central
    idea which is the basis on which it rests. He urged the Society
    to take a lesson from the deceased, and recognizing the
    responsibility of their position, to labor with earnestness, and
    to consecrate their whole beings to the cause of right and
    reform. It is impossible for us to give any fair abstract of Mr.
    Powell's earnest and eloquent tribute to his friend, on whom he
    had looked, he said, as "a Father in Israel" from his boyhood.

    William Howard Day, then came forward, saying, he understood
    that it would not be considered inappropriate for one of his
    race to say a few words on this occasion, and make some attempt
    to pay a fitting tribute to one to whom they owed so much. He
    did not feel to-day like paying such a tribute, his grief was
    too fresh upon him, his heart too bowed down, and he could do no
    more, than in behalf of his race, not only those here, but the
    host the deceased has befriended, and of the whole four millions
    to whom he had been so true a friend, cast a tribute of praise
    and thanks upon his grave.

    Rev. Alfred Cookman, of Grace M.E. Church, next arose, and said
    that he came there intending to say nothing, but the scene moved
    him to a few words. He remembered once standing in front of St.
    Paul's Cathedral, in London, and seeing therein the name of the
    architect, Sir Christopher Wren, inscribed, and under it this
    inscription: "Stranger, if you would see his monument look about
    you." And the thought came to him that if you would see the
    monument of him who lies there, look about you and see it built
    in stones of living hearts. He thanked God for the works of this
    man; he thanked Him especially for his noble character. He said
    that he felt that that body had been the temple of a noble
    spirit, aye the temple of God himself, and some day they would
    meet the spirit in the heavenly land beyond the grave.

    Lucretia Mott arose, and said she feared the claim might appear
    to be made that Quakerism alone held the great central principle
    which dominated this man's life; but she wished it understood
    that they recognized this "voice within" as leading and guiding
    all men, and they probably meant by it much the same as those
    differing from them meant by the Third person in their Trinity.
    She did not wish, even in appearance, to claim a belief in this
    voice for her own sect alone.

    T. Clarkson Taylor then said, that the time for closing the
    services had arrived, and in a very few words commended the
    lesson of his life to those present, after which the meeting
    dissolved, and the body was carried to the grave-yard in the
    rear of the meeting-house, and deposited in its last
    resting-place.




THE TRIAL OF THE CASES, 1848.



    To the Editor of the Commercial:

    Your admirable and interesting sketch of the career of the late
    Thomas Garrett contains one or two statements, which, according
    to my recollection of the facts, are not entirely accurate, and
    are perhaps of sufficient importance to be corrected.

    The proceedings in the U.S. Circuit Court were not public
    prosecutions or indictments, but civil suits instituted by the
    owners of the runaway slaves, who employed and paid counsel to
    conduct them. An act of Congress, then in force, imposed a
    penalty of five hundred dollars on any person who should
    knowingly harbor or conceal a fugitive from labor, to be
    recovered by and for the benefit of the claimant of such
    fugitive, in any Court proper to try the same; saving, moreover,
    to the claimant his right of action for or on account of loss,
    etc.; thus giving to the slave-owner two cases for action for
    each fugitive, one of debt for the penalty, and one of trespass
    for damages.

    There were in all seven slaves, only the husband and father of
    the family being free, who escaped under the friendly help and
    guidance of Mr. Garrett, five of whom were claimed by E.N.
    Turner, and the remaining two by C.T. Glanding, both claimants
    being residents of Maryland.

    In the suits for the penalties, Turner obtained judgment for
    twenty-five hundred dollars, and Glanding, one for one thousand
    dollars. In these cases the jury could give neither less nor
    more than the amount of the penalties, on the proper proof being
    made. Nor in the trespass case did the jury give "larger damages
    than were claimed." A jury sometimes does queer things, but it
    cannot make a verdict for a greater sum than the plaintiff
    demands; in the trespass cases, Glanding had a verdict for one
    thousand dollars damages, but in Turner's case only nine hundred
    dollars were allowed, though the plaintiff sued for twenty-five
    hundred.

    It is hardly true to say that any one of the juries was
    _packed_, indeed, it would have been a difficult matter in that
    day for the Marshal to summon thirty sober, honest, and
    judicious men, fairly and impartially chosen from the three
    counties of Delaware, who would have found verdicts different
    from those which were rendered. The jury must have been fixed
    for the defendant to have secured any other result, on the
    supposition that the testimony admitted of any doubt or
    question, the anti-slavery men in the state being like Virgil's
    ship-wrecked mariners, very few in number and scattered over a
    vast space.

    What most redounds to the honor and praise of Mr. Garrett, in
    this transaction, as a noble and disinterested philanthropist
    is, that after the fugitives had been discharged from custody
    under the writ of _habeas corpus_, and when he had been advised
    by his lawyer, who was also his personal friend, to keep his
    hands off and let the party work their own passage to a haven of
    freedom, not then far distant, or he might be involved in
    serious trouble, he deliberately refused to abandon them to the
    danger of pursuit and capture. The welfare and happiness of too
    many human beings were at stake to permit him to think of
    personal consequences, and he was ready and dared to encounter
    any risk for himself, so that he could insure the safety of
    those fleeing from bondage. It was this heroic purpose to
    protect the weak and helpless at any cost, this fearless
    unselfish action, not stopping to weigh the contingencies of
    individual gain or loss, that constitutes his best title to the
    gratitude of those he served, and to the admiration and respect
    of all who can appreciate independent conduct springing from
    pure and lofty motives. He did what he thought and believed to
    be right, and let the consequences take care of themselves. He
    never would directly or otherwise, entice a slave to leave his
    master; but he never would refuse his aid to the hunted, panting
    wretch that in the pursuit of happiness was seeking after
    liberty. And who among us is now bold enough to say, that in all
    this he did not see clearly, act bravely, do justly, and live up
    to the spirit of the sacred text:--"Whatsoever ye would that men
    should do to you, do ye even so to them?"

    W.


In a letter addressed to one of the sons, William Lloyd Garrison pays
the following beautiful and just tribute to his faithfulness in the
cause of freedom.


    BOSTON, January 25th, 1871.

    MY DEAR FRIEND:--I have received the intelligence of the death
    of your honored and revered father, with profound emotions. If
    it were not for the inclemency of the weather, and the delicate
    state of my health, I would hasten to be at the funeral, long as
    the distance is; not indeed as a mourner, for, in view of his
    ripe old age, and singularly beneficent life, there is no cause
    for sorrow, but to express the estimation in which I held him,
    as one of the best men who ever walked the earth, and one of the
    most beloved among my numerous friends and co-workers in the
    cause of an oppressed and down-trodden race, now happily
    rejoicing in their heavenly-wrought deliverance. For to no one
    was the language of Job more strictly applicable than to
    himself:--"When the ear heard me, then it blessed me, and when
    the eye saw me, it gave witness to me; because I delivered the
    poor that cried, and the fatherless, and him that had none to
    help him. The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon
    me; and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. I put on
    righteousness, and it clothed me; my judgment was as a robe and
    a diadem. I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame. I
    was a father to the poor; and the cause which I knew not I
    searched out. And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked
    the spoil out of his teeth." This is an exact portraiture of
    your father, a most comprehensive delineation of his character
    as a philanthropist and reformer. It was his meat and drink.

      "The poor to feed, the lost to seek,
        To proffer life to death,
      Hope to the erring, to the weak
        The strength of his own faith.


      "To plead the captive's right; remove
        The sting of hate from law;
      And soften in the fire of love
        The hardened steel of war.


      "He walked the dark world in the mild,
        Still guidance of the light;
      In tearful tenderness a child,
        A strong man in the right."


    Did there ever live one who had less of that "fear of man which
    bringeth a snare," than himself? Or who combined more moral
    courage with exceeding tenderness of spirit? Or who adhered more
    heroically to his convictions of duty in the face of deadly
    peril and certain suffering? Or who gave himself more
    unreservedly, or with greater disinterestedness, to the service
    of bleeding humanity? Or who took more joyfully the spoiling of
    his goods as the penalty of his sympathy for the hunted
    fugitive? Or who more untiringly kept pace with all the
    progressive movements of the age, as though in the very
    freshness of adult life, while venerable with years? Or who, as
    a husband, father, friend, citizen, or neighbor, more nobly
    performed all the duties, or more generally distributed all the
    charities of life? He will leave a great void in the community.
    Such a stalwart soul appears only at rare intervals. Delaware,
    enslaved, treated him like a felon; Delaware, redeemed, will be
    proud of his memory.

      "Only the actions of the just
      Smell sweet and blossom in the dust."


    His rightful place is conspicuously among the benefactors,
    saviours, martyrs of the human race.

    His career was full of dramatic interest from beginning to end,
    and crowded with the experiences and vicissitudes of a most
    eventful nature. What he promised he fulfilled; what he
    attempted, he seldom, or never failed to accomplish; what he
    believed, he dared to proclaim upon the housetop; what he
    ardently desired, and incessantly labored for, was the reign of
    universal freedom, peace, and righteousness. He was among the
    manliest of men, and the gentlest of spirits. There was no form
    of human suffering that did not touch his heart; but his
    abounding sympathy was especially drawn out towards the poor,
    imbruted slaves of the plantation, and such of their number as
    sought their freedom by flight. The thousands that passed safely
    through his hands, on their way to Canada and the North, will
    never forget his fatherly solicitude for their welfare, or the
    dangers he unflinchingly encountered in their behalf. Stripped
    of all his property under the Fugitive Slave law, for giving
    them food, shelter, and assistance to continue their flight, he
    knew not what it was to be intimidated or disheartened, but gave
    himself to the same blessed work as though conscious of no loss.
    Great-hearted philanthropist, what heroism could exceed thy own?

      "For, while the jurist sitting with the slave-whip o'er him swung,
      From the tortured truths of freedom the lie of slavery wrung,
      And the solemn priest to Moloch, on each God-deserted shrine,
      Broke the bondman's heart for bread, poured the bondman's blood
                for wine--
      While the multitude in blindness to a far-off Saviour knelt,
      And spurned, the while, the temple where a present Saviour dwelt;
      Thou beheld'st Him in the task-field, in the prison shadow dim,
      And thy mercy to the bondman, it was mercy unto Him!"


    I trust some one, well qualified to execute the pleasing task,
    will write his biography for the grand lessons his life
    inculcated. Yours, in full sympathy and trust,

    WM. LLOYD GARRISON.


A contemporary who had known him long and intimately--who had
appreciated his devotion to freedom, who had shared with him some of the
perils consequent upon aiding the fleeing fugitives, and who belonged to
the race with whom Garrett sympathized, and for whose elevation and
freedom he labored so assiduously with an overflowing heart of tender
regard and sympathy--penned the following words, touching the sad event:


    CHATHAM, C.W., January 30, 1871.

    To MR. HENRY GARRETT:--Dear Sir:--I have just heard, through the
    kindness of my friend, Mrs. Graves, of the death of your dear
    father; the intelligence makes me feel sad and sorrowful; I
    sincerely sympathize with you and all your brothers and sisters,
    in your mournful bereavement; but you do not mourn without hope,
    for you have an assurance in his death that your loss is his
    infinite gain. For he was a good Christian, a good husband, a
    good father, a good citizen, and a truly good Samaritan, for his
    heart, his hand and his purse, were ever open to the wants of
    suffering humanity, wherever he found it; irrespective of the
    country, religion, or complexion of the sufferer. Hence there
    are many more who mourn his loss, as well as yourselves; and I
    know, verily, that many a silent tear was shed by his
    fellow-citizens, both white and colored, when he took his
    departure; especially the colored ones; for he loved them with a
    brother's love, not because they were colored, but because they
    were oppressed, and, like John Brown, he loved them to the last;
    that was manifest by his request that they should be his
    bearers. I can better feel than I have language to express the
    mournful and sorrowing pride that must have stirred the inmost
    souls of those men of color, who had the honor conferred on them
    of bearing his mortal remains to their last resting-place, when
    they thought of what a sacred trust was committed to their
    hands. We are told to mark the perfect man, and behold the
    upright, for the end of that man is peace; and such was the end
    of your dear father, and he has gone to join the innumerable
    company of the spirits of the just, made perfect on the other
    side of the river, where there is a rest remaining for all the
    children of God. My brother, Abraham D. Shadd, and my sister
    Amelia, join their love and condolence with mine to you all,
    hoping that the virtues of your father may be a guiding star to
    you all, until you meet him again in that happy place, where
    parting will be no more, forever.

    Your humble friend, ELIZABETH J. WILLIAMS.


From the learned and the unlearned, from those in high places and from
those in humble stations, many testimonials reached the family,
respecting this great friend of the slave, but it is doubtful, whether a
single epistle from any one, was more affectingly appreciated by the
bereaved family, than the epistle just quoted from Elizabeth J.
Williams.

The Slave's most eloquent advocate, Wendell Phillips, in the "National
Standard," of February 4, 1871, in honor of the departed, bore the
following pertinent testimony to his great worth in the cause of
Liberty.


    "I should not dare to trust my memory for the number of fugitive
    slaves this brave old friend has helped to safety and
    freedom--nearly three thousand, I believe. What a rich life to
    look back on! How skilful and adroit he was, in eluding the
    hunters! How patient in waiting days and weeks, keeping the poor
    fugitives hidden meanwhile, till it was safe to venture on the
    highway! What whole-hearted devotion, what unselfish giving of
    time, means, and everything else to this work of brotherly love!
    What house in Delaware, so honorable in history, as that where
    hunted men fled, and were sure to find refuge. It was the North
    Star to many a fainting heart. This century has grand scenes to
    show and boast of among its fellows. But few transcend that
    auction-block where the sheriff was selling all Garrett's goods
    for the crime (!) of giving a breakfast to a family of fugitive
    slaves. As the sale closed, the officer turns to Garrett,
    saying: 'Thomas, I hope you'll never be caught at this again.'

    "'Friend,' was the reply, 'I haven't a dollar in the world, but
    if thee knows a fugitive who needs a breakfast, send him to me.'

    "Over such a scene, Luther and Howard and Clarkson clapped their
    hands.

    "Such a speech redeems the long infamy of the State. It is
    endurable, the having of such a blot as Delaware in our history,
    when it has once been the home of such a man. I remember well
    the just pride with which he told me, that after that sale,
    pro-slavery as Wilmington was, he could have a discount at the
    bank as readily as any man in the city. Though the laws robbed
    him, his fellow-citizens could not but respect and trust him,
    love and honor him.

    "The city has never had, we believe, a man die in it worthy of a
    statue. We advise it to seize this opportunity to honor itself
    and perpetuate the good name of its worthiest citizen, by
    immortalizing some street, spot, shaft or building with his
    name.

    "Brave, generous, high-souled, sturdy, outspoken friend of all
    that needed aid or sympathy, farewell for these scenes! In times
    to come, when friendless men and hated ideas need champions, God
    grant them as gallant and successful ones as you have been, and
    may the State you honored grow worthy of you. WENDELL PHILLIPS."


Likewise in the "National Standard," the editor, Aaron M. Powell, who
attended the funeral, paid the following glowing tribute to the moral,
religious, and anti-slavery character of the slave's friend:


    On the 24th inst., Thomas Garrett, in his eighty-second year,
    passed on to the higher life. A week previous we had visited him
    in his sick chamber, and, on leaving him felt that he must go
    hence ere long. He was the same strong, resolute man in spirit
    to the last. He looked forward to the welcome change with
    perfect serenity and peace of mind. And well he might, for he
    had indeed fought the good fight and been faithful unto the end.

    He was most widely known for his services to fugitive slaves.
    Twenty-five hundred and forty-five he had preserved a record of;
    and he had assisted somewhat more than two hundred prior to the
    commencement of the record. Picture to the mind's eye this
    remarkable procession of nearly three thousand men, women and
    children fleeing from Slavery, and finding in this brave,
    large-hearted man, a friend equal to their needs in so critical
    an emergency! No wonder he was feared by the slave-holders, not
    alone of his own State, but of the whole South. If their human
    chattels once reached his outpost, there was indeed little hope
    of their reclamation. The friend and helper of fugitives from
    Slavery, truly their Moses, he was more than this, he was the
    discriminating, outspoken, uncompromising opponent of Slavery
    itself. He was one of the strongest pillars and one of the most
    efficient working-members of the American Anti-slavery Society.
    He was an abolitionist of the most radical and pronounced
    character, though a resident of a slave State, and through all
    the period wherein to be an abolitionist was to put in jeopardy,
    not only reputation and property, but life itself. Though he
    rarely addressed public meetings, his presence imparted much
    strength to others, was "weighty" in the best Quaker sense. He
    was of the rare type of character, represented by Francis
    Jackson and James Mott.

    Thomas Garrett was a member of the Society of Friends, and as
    such, served by the striking contrast of his own life and
    character, with the average of the Society, to exemplify to the
    world the real, genuine Quakerism. It is not at all to the
    credit of his fellow-members, that it must be said of them, that
    when he was bearing the cross and doing the work for which he is
    now so universally honored, they, many of them, were not only
    not in sympathy with him, but would undoubtedly, if they had had
    the requisite vitality and courage, have cut him off from their
    denominational fellowship. He was a sincere, earnest believer in
    the cardinal point of Quakerism, the Divine presence in the
    human soul--this furnishes the key to his action through life.
    This divine attribute he regarded not as the birth-right of
    Friends alone, not of one race, sex or class, but of all
    mankind. Therefore was he an abolitionist; therefore was he
    interested in the cause of the Indians; therefore was he
    enlisted in the cause of equal rights for women; therefore was
    he a friend of temperance, of oppressed and needy working-men
    and women, world-wide in the scope of his philanthropic
    sympathy, and broadly catholic, and comprehensive in his views
    of religious life and duty. He was the soul of honor in
    business. His experience, when deprived at sixty, of every
    dollar of his property for having obeyed God rather than man, in
    assisting fugitives from Slavery, and the promptness with which
    his friends came forward with proffered co-operation, furnishes
    a lesson which all should ponder well. He had little respect
    for, or patience with shams of any kind, in religious, political
    or social life.

    As we looked upon Thomas Garrett's calm, serene face, mature in
    a ripe old age, still shadowing forth kindliness of heart,
    firmness of purpose, discriminating intelligence, conscientious,
    manly uprightness, death never seemed more beautiful:

      "Why, what is Death but Life
      In other forms of being? Life without
      The coarser attributes of men, the dull
      And momently decaying frame which holds
      The ethereal spirit in, and binds it down
      To brotherhood with brutes! There's no
      Such thing as Death; what's so-called is but
      The beginning of a new existence, a fresh
      Segment of the eternal round of change."

Another warm admirer of this Great Lover of humanity, in a letter to
George W. Stone thus alludes to his life and death:


    TAUNTON, MASS., June 25th, 1871.

    DEAR STONE:--Your telegram announcing the death of that old
    soldier and saint, and my good friend, Thos. Garrett, reached me
    last evening at ten o'clock.

    My first impulse was to start for Wilmington, and be present at
    his funeral; but when I considered my work here, and my
    engagements for the next four days, I found it impossible to go.

    I will be there in spirit, and bow my inmost soul before the All
    Loving One, his Father and ours, in humble thankfulness, that I
    ever knew him, and had the privilege of enjoying his friendship
    and witnessing his devotion, to the interest of every good cause
    of benevolence and Reform.

    I could write you many things of interest which I heard from
    him, and which I have noted on my memory and heart; but I cannot
    now. I think he was one of the remarkable men of the times, in
    faith, in holy boldness, in fearless devotion to the right, in
    uncompromising integrity, in unselfish benevolence, in love to
    God and man, and in unceasing, life-long efforts to do justly,
    to love mercy, and to walk humbly with God. We shall not soon
    look upon his like again.

    If I was present at his funeral, I should take it as a privilege
    to pronounce his name, and say, as I never said before, "Blessed
    are the dead that die in the Lord; even so saith the Spirit; for
    they rest from their labors, and their works do follow them."

    Do, at once, see his children and Clarkson Taylor, and give them
    my condolence, no, my _congratulation_, and assure them that
    they have a rich legacy in his noble life, and he has a glorious
    reward in the bosom of God.

    Peace to his memory! Noble old man, so pure and peaceful, and
    yet so strong, firm, and fearless, so gentle, tender, and
    truthful, afraid and ashamed of nothing but sin, and in love and
    labor with every good work.

    I could write on and fill many pages. But he desired no eulogy,
    and needs none. He lives, and will live for ever in many hearts
    and in the heaven of heavens above.

    T. ISRAEL.


If it were necessary we might continue to introduce scores of
editorials, communications, epistles, etc., all breathing a similar
spirit of respect for the rare worth of this wonderful man, but space
forbids. In conclusion, therefore, with a view of presenting him in the
light of his own interesting letters, written when absorbed in his
peculiar work, from a large number on file the following are submitted:


    WILMINGTON, 11th mo. 21st, 1855.

    ESTEEMED FRIEND, WM. STILL:--Thine of this date, inquiring for
    the twenty-one, and how they have been disposed of, has just
    been received. I can only answer by saying, when I parted with
    them yesterday forenoon, I gave the wife of the person, in whose
    house they were, money to pay her expenses to Philadelphia and
    back in the cars to pilot the four women to thy place. I gave
    her husband money to pay a pilot to start yesterday with the ten
    men, divided in two gangs; also a letter for thee. I hope they
    have arrived safe ere this. I had to leave town soon after noon
    yesterday to attend a brother ill with an attack of apoplexy,
    and to-day I have been very much engaged. The place they stayed
    here is a considerable distance off. I will make inquiry
    to-morrow morning, and in case any other disposition has been
    made of them than the above I will write thee. I should think
    they have stopped to-day, in consequence of the rain, and most
    likely will arrive safe to-morrow. In haste, thy friend,

    THOS. GARRETT.


Although having "to attend a brother, ill with an attack of apoplexy,"
Garrett took time to attend to the interest of the "twenty-one," as the
above letter indicates. How many other men in the United States, under
similar circumstances, would have been thus faithful?

On another occasion deeply concerned for A FORWARDER OF SLAVES, he wrote
thus:


    WILMINGTON, 12th mo. 26th, 1855.

    ESTEEMED FRIEND, WM. STILL:--The bearer of this, George Wilmer,
    is a slave, whose residence is in Maryland. He is a true man,
    and a forwarder of slaves. Has passed some twenty-five within
    four months. He is desirous of finding some of his relations,
    Wm. Mann and Thomas Carmichael, they passed here about a month
    since. If thee can give him any information where they can be
    found thee will much oblige him, and run no risk of their safety
    in so doing. I remain, as ever, thy sincere friend,

    THOS. GARRETT.


"Four able-bodied men," form the subject of the subjoined
correspondence:


    WILMINGTON, 11th mo., 4th, 1856.

    ESTEEMED FRIENDS, J. Miller McKim and William Still:--Captain
    F., has arrived here this day, with four able-bodied men. One is
    an engineer, and has been engaged in sawing lumber, a second, a
    good house-carpenter, a third a blacksmith, and the fourth a
    farm hand. They are now five hundred miles from their home in
    Carolina, and would be glad to get situations, without going far
    from here. I will keep them till to-morrow. Please inform me
    whether thee knows of a suitable place in the country where the
    mechanics can find employment at their trades for the winter;
    let me hear to-morrow, and oblige your friend,

    THOMAS GARRETT.


"What has become of Harriet Tubman?" (agent of the Underground Rail
Road), is made a subject of special inquiry in the following note:


    WILMINGTON, 3d mo., 27th, 1857.

    ESTEEMED FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--I have been very anxious for
    some time past, to hear what has become of Harriet Tubman. The
    last I heard of her, she was in the State of New York, on her
    way to Canada with some friends, last fall. Has thee seen, or
    heard anything of her lately? It would be a sorrowful fact, if
    such a hero as she, should be lost from the Underground Rail
    Road. I have just received a letter from Ireland, making inquiry
    respecting her. If thee gets this in time, and knows anything
    respecting her, please drop me a line by mail to-morrow, and I
    will get it next morning if not sooner, and oblige thy friend.

    I have heard nothing from the eighth man from Dover, but trust
    he is safe.

    THOMAS GARRETT.


On being informed that Harriet was "all right," the following extract
from a subsequent letter, expresses his satisfaction over the good news,
and at the same time, indicates his sympathy for a "poor traveler," who
had fallen a victim to the cold weather, and being severely
frost-bitten, had died of lock-jaw, as related on page 52.


    "I was truly glad to learn that Harriet Tubman was still in good
    health and ready for action, but I think there will be more
    danger at present than heretofore, there is so much excitement
    below in consequence of the escape of those eight slaves. I was
    truly sorry to hear of the fate of that poor fellow who had
    periled so much for liberty. I was in hopes from what thee told
    me, that he would recover with the loss perhaps of some of his
    toes.

    THOMAS GARRETT."


In the next letter, an interesting anecdote is related of an encounter
on the Underground Rail Road, between the fugitives and several
Irishmen, and how one of the old countrymen was shot in the forehead,
etc., which G. thought would make such opponents to the Road "more
cautious."


    WILMINGTON, 11th mo., 5th, 1857.

    ESTEEMED FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--I have just written a note for
    the bearer to William Murphy Chester, who will direct him on to
    thy care; he left his home about a week since. I hear in the
    lower part of this State, he met with a friend to pilot him some
    twenty-five miles last night. We learn that one party of those
    last week were attacked with clubs by several Irish and that one
    of them was shot in the forehead, the ball entering to the skull
    bone, and passing under the skin partly round the head. My
    informant says he is likely to recover, but it will leave an
    ugly mark it is thought, as long as he lives. We have not been
    able to learn, whether the party was on the look out for them,
    or whether they were rowdies out on a Hallow-eve frolic; but be
    it which it may, I presume they will be more cautious here how
    they trifle with such. Desiring thee prosperity and happiness, I
    remain thy friend,

    THOMAS GARRETT.




FOUR OF GOD'S POOR.


The following letter shows the fearless manner in which he attended to
the duties of his station:


    WILMINGTON, 9th mo. 6th, 1857.

    RESPECTED FRIEND, WM. STILL:--This evening I send to thy care
    four of God's poor. Severn Johnson, a true man, will go with
    them to-night by rail road to thy house. I have given Johnson
    five dollars, which will pay all expenses, and leave each
    twenty-five cents. We are indebted to Captain F----t----n for
    those. May success attend them in their efforts to maintain
    themselves. Please send word by Johnson whether or no, those
    seven arrived safe I wrote thee of ten days since. My wife and
    self were at Longwood to-day, had a pleasant ride and good
    meeting. We are, as ever, thy friend,

    THOS. GARRETT.


Quite a satisfactory account is given, in the letter below of the
"Irishman who was shot in the forehead;" also of one of the same kin,
who in meddling with Underground Rail Road passengers, got his arm
broken in two places, etc.


    WILMINGTON, 11th mo. 14th, 1857.

    ESTEEMED FRIEND, WM. STILL:--Thy favor of a few days since came
    to hand, giving quite a satisfactory account of the large
    company.

    I find in the melee near this town, one of the Irishmen got his
    arm broken in two places. The one shot in the forehead is badly
    marked, but not dangerously injured. I learn to-day, that the
    carriage in that company, owing to fast driving with such a
    heavy load, is badly broken, and the poor horse was badly
    injured; it has not been able to do anything since.

    Please say to my friend, Rebecca Hart, that I have heretofore
    kept clear of persuading, or even advising slaves to leave their
    masters till they had fully made up their minds to leave,
    knowing as I do there is great risk in so doing, and if betrayed
    once would be a serious injury to the cause hereafter. I had
    spoken to one colored man to try to see him, but he was not
    willing to risk it. If he has any desire to get away, he can,
    during one night, before they miss him, get out of the reach of
    danger. Booth has moved into New Castle, and left the two boys
    on the farm. If Rebecca Hart will write to me, and give me the
    name of the boy, and the name of his mother, I will make another
    effort. The man I spoke to lives in New Castle, and thinks the
    mother of the boy alluded to lives between here and New Castle.
    The young men's association here wants Wendell Phillips to
    deliver a lecture on the lost arts, and some of the rest of us
    wish him to deliver a lecture on Slavery. Where will a letter
    reach him soonest, as I wish to write him on the subject. I
    thought he could perhaps deliver two lectures, two nights in
    succession. If thee can give the above information, thee will
    much oblige--

    GARRETT & SON.


In his business-like transactions, without concealment, he places
matters in such a light that the wayfaring man, though a fool, need not
err, as may here be seen.


    WILMINGTON, 11th mo. 25th, 1857.

    ESTEEMED FRIEND, WM. STILL:--I now send Johnson, one of our
    colored men, up with the three men I wrote thee about. Johnson
    has undertook to have them well washed and cleaned during the
    day. And I have provided them with some second-hand clothes, to
    make them comfortable, a new pair of shoes and stockings, and
    shall pay Johnson for taking care of them. I mention this so
    that thee may know. Thee need not advance him any funds. In the
    present case I shall furnish them with money to pay their fare
    to Philadelphia, and Johnson home again. Hoping they will get on
    safe, I remain thy friend,

    THOS. GARRETT.




FOUR FEMALES ON BOARD.


The fearless Garrett communicated through the mail, as usual, the
following intelligence:


    WILMINGTON, 8th mo. 25th, 1859.

    ESTEEMED FRIEND, WM. STILL:--The brig Alvena, of Lewistown, is
    in the Delaware opposite here, with four females on board. The
    colored man, who has them in charge, was employed by the husband
    of one of them to bring his wife up. When he arrived here, he
    found the man had left. As the vessel is bound to Red Bank, I
    have advised him to take them there in the vessel, and to-morrow
    take them in the steamboat to the city, and to the Anti-slavery
    office. He says they owe the captain one dollar and fifty cents
    for board, and I gave him three dollars, to pay the captain and
    take them to your office. I have a man here, to go on to-night,
    that was nearly naked; shall rig him out pretty comfortably.
    Poor fellow, he has lost his left hand, but he says he can take
    care of himself. In haste, thy friend,

    THOS. GARRETT.


While Father Abraham was using his utmost powers to put down the
rebellion, in 1864, a young man who had "been most unrighteously sold
for seven years," desirous of enlisting, sought advice from the wise and
faithful Underground Rail Road manager, who gave him the following
letter, which may be looked upon in the light of a rare anecdote, as
there is no doubt but that the "professed non-resistant" in this
instance, hoped to see the poor fellow "_snugly fixed in his
regimentals_" doing service for "Father Abraham."


    WILMINGTON, 1st mo. 23d, 1864.

    RESPECTED FRIEND, WILLIAM STILL:--The bearer of this, Winlock
    Clark, has lately been most unrighteously sold for seven years,
    and is desirous of enlisting, and becoming one of Uncle Sam's
    boys; I have advised him to call on thee so that no land sharks
    shall get any bounty for enlisting him; he has a wife and
    several children, and whatever bounty the government or the
    State allows him, will be of use to his family. Please write me
    when he is snugly fixed in his regimentals, so that I may send
    word to his wife. By so doing, thee will much oblige thy friend,
    and the friend of humanity,

    THOMAS GARRETT.

    N.B. Am I naughty, being a professed non-resistant, to advise
    this poor fellow to serve Father Abraham? T.G.


We have given so many of these inimitable Underground Rail Road letters
from the pen of the sturdy old laborer, not only because they will be
new to the readers of this work, but because they so fittingly
illustrate his practical devotion to the Slave, and his cheerfulness--in
the face of danger and difficulty--in a manner that other pens might
labor in vain to describe.



DANIEL GIBBONS.


A life as uneventful as the one whose story we are about to tell,
affords little scope for the genius of the biographer or the historian,
but being carefully studied, it cannot fail to teach a lesson of
devotion and self-sacrifice, which should be learned and remembered by
every succeeding age.

Daniel Gibbons, son of James and Deborah (Hoopes) Gibbons, was born on
the banks of Mill Creek, in Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, on the 21st
day of the 12th month (December), 1775. He was descended on his father's
side from an English ancestor, whose name appears on the colonial
records, as far back as 1683. John Gibbons evidently came with or before
William Penn to this "goodly heritage of freedom." His earthly remains
lie at Concord Friends' burying-ground, Delaware county, near where the
family lived for a generation or two. The grandfather of Daniel Gibbons,
who lived near where West Town boarding-school now is, in Chester
county, bought for seventy pounds, "one thousand acres of land and
allowances," in what is now Lancaster county, intending, as he
ultimately did, to settle his three sons upon it. This purchase was made
about the year 1715. In process of time, the eldest son, desiring to
marry Deborah Hoopes, the daughter of Daniel Hoopes, of a neighboring
township in Chester county, the young people obtained the consent of
parents and friends, but it was a time of grief and mourning among young
and old. The young Friends assured the intended bride, that they would
not marry the best man in the Province and do what she was about to do;
and the elder dames, so far relaxed the Puritanic rigidity of their
rules, as to allow the invitation of an uncommonly large company of
guests to the wedding, in order that a long and perhaps last farewell,
might be said to the beloved daughter, who, with her husband, was about
to emigrate to the "far West." Loud and long were the lamentations, and
warm the embraces of these simple-minded Christian rustics, companions
of toil and deprivation, as they parted from two of their number who
were to leave their circle for the West; the West being then thirty-six
miles distant. This was on the sixth day of the fifth month, 1756. More
than a century has passed away; all the good people, eighty-nine in
number, who signed the wedding certificate as witnesses, have passed
away, and how vast is the change wrought in our midst since that day!

Joseph Gibbons was so much pleased with the daring enterprise of his son
and daughter-in-law, that he gave them one hundred acres of land in his
Western possessions more than he reserved for his other and younger
sons, and to it they immediately emigrated, and building first a cabin
and the next year a store-house, began life for themselves in earnest.

It is interesting, in view of the long and consistent anti-slavery
course which Daniel Gibbons pursued, to trace the influence that wrought
upon him while his character was maturing, and the causes which led him
to see the wickedness of the system which he opposed.

The Society of Friends in that day bore in mind the advice of their
great founder, Fox, whose last words were: "Friends, mind the light."
And following that guide which leads out of all evil and into all good,
they viewed every custom of society with eyes undimmed by prejudice, and
were influenced in every action of life by a belief in the common
brotherhood of man, and a resolve to obey the command of Jesus, to love
one another. This being the case, slavery and oppression of all kinds
were unpopular, and indeed almost unknown amongst them.

James Gibbons was a republican, and an enthusiastic advocate of American
liberty. Being a man of commanding presence, and great energy and
determination, efforts were made during the Revolution to induce him to
enlist as a cavalry soldier. He was prevented from so doing by the
entreaties of his wife, and his own conscientious scruples as a Friend.
About the time of the Revolution, or immediately after, he removed to
the borough of Wilmington, Delaware, where, being surrounded by slavery,
he became more than ever alive to its iniquities. He was interested
during his whole life in getting slaves off. And being elected second
burgess of Wilmington during his residence there, his official position
gave him great opportunities to assist in this noble work. It is related
that during his magistracy a slave-holder brought a colored man before
him, whom he claimed as his slave. There being no evidence of the
alleged ownership, the colored man was set at liberty. The pretended
owner was inclined to be impudent; but James Gibbons told him promptly
that nothing but silence and good behaviour on his part would prevent
his commitment for contempt of court.

About the year 1790, James Gibbons came back to Lancaster county, where
he spent twenty years in the practice of those deeds which will remain
"in everlasting remembrance;" dying, full of years and honors, in 1810.

Born in the first year of the revolution and growing up surrounded by
such influences, Daniel Gibbons could not have been other than he was,
the friend of the down-trodden and oppressed of every nationality and
color. In 1789 his father took him to see General Washington, then
passing through Wilmington. To the end of his life he retained a vivid
recollection of this visit, and would recount its incidents to his
family and friends. During his father's residence in Wilmington, he
spent his summers with kinsmen in Lancaster county, learning to be a
farmer, and his winters in Wilmington going to school.

At the age of fourteen years he was bound an apprentice, as was the good
custom of the day, to a Friend in Lancaster county to learn the tanning
business. At this he served about six years, or until his master ceased
to follow the business. During this apprenticeship he became accustomed
to severe labor, so severe indeed that he never recovered from the
effects thereof, having a difficulty in walking during the remainder of
his life, which prevented him from taking the active part in Underground
Rail Road business which he otherwise would have done. His father's
estate being involved in litigation caused him to be put to this trade,
farming being his favorite employment, and one which he followed during
his whole life.

In 1805 he took a pedestrian tour, by way of New York, Albany, and
Niagara Falls to the State of Ohio, then the far West, coming home by
way of Pittsburg, and walking altogether one thousand three hundred and
fifty miles. In this trip he increased the injury to his feet, so as to
render himself virtually a cripple. Upon the death of his father, he
settled upon the farm, on which he died.

About the year 1808 on going to visit some friends, who had removed to
Adams county, Pennsylvania, he became acquainted with Hannah Wierman,
whom he married on the fourth day of the fifth month, 1815. At this time
Daniel Gibbous was about forty years old, and his wife about
twenty-eight, she having been born on the ninth of the seventh month,
1787. A life of one after their union, would be incomplete without some
notice of the other.

During a married life of thirty-seven years, Hannah Gibbons was the
assistant of her husband in every good and noble work. Possessed of a
warm heart, a powerful, though uncultivated intellect, an excellent
judgment, and great sweetness of disposition, she was fitted both by
nature and training to endure without murmuring the inconvenience and
trouble incident to the reception and care of fugitives and to rejoice
that to her was given the opportunity of assisting them in their efforts
to be free.

The true measure of greatness in a human soul, is its willingness to
suffer for its own good, or the good of its fellows, its
self-sacrificing spirit. Granting the truth of this, one of the greatest
souls was that of Hannah W. Gibbons. The following incident is a proof
of this:

In 1836, when she was no longer a young woman, there came to her home,
one of the poorest, most ignorant, and filthiest of mankind--a slave
from the great valley of Virginia. He was foot-sore and weary, and could
not tell how he came, or who directed him. He seemed indeed, a missive
directed and sent by the hand of the Almighty. Before he could be
cleansed or recruited, he was taken sick, and before he could be removed
(even if he could have been trusted at the county poor house), his case
was pronounced to be small-pox. For six long weeks did this good angel
in human form, attend upon this unfortunate object. Reasons were found
why no one else could do it, and with her own hands, she ministered to
his wants, until he was restored to health. Such was her life. This is
merely one case. She was always ready to do her duty. Her interest in
good, never left her, for when almost dying, she aroused from her
lethargy and asked if Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the
United States, which he was a few days afterwards. She always predicted
a civil war, in the settlement of the Slavery question.

During the last twenty-five years of her life she was an elder in the
Society of Friends, of which she had always been an earnest, consistent,
and devoted member. Her patience, self-denial, and warm affection were
manifested in every relation of life. As a daughter, wife, mother,
friend, and mistress of a family she was beloved by all, and to her
relatives and friends who are left behind, the remembrance of her good
deeds comes wafted like a perfume from beyond the golden gates. She
survived her husband about eight years, dying on the sixteenth of the
tenth month, 1860. Three children, sons, were born to their marriage,
two of whom died in infancy and one still (1871) survives.

To give some idea of the course pursued by Daniel and Hannah Gibbons, I
insert the following letter, containing an account of events which took
place in 1821:


    "A short time since, I learned that my old friend, William
    Still, was about to publish a history of the Underground Rail
    Road. His own experience in the service of this road would make
    a large volume. I was brought up by Daniel Gibbons, and am asked
    to say what I know of him as an abolitionist. From my earliest
    recollection, he was a friend to the colored people, and often
    hired them and paid them liberal wages. His house was a depot
    for fugitives, and many hundreds has he helped on their way to
    freedom. Many a dark night he has sent me to carry them victuals
    and change their places of refuge, and take them to other
    people's barns, when not safe for him to go. I have known him
    start in the night and go fifty miles with them, when they were
    very hotly pursued. One man and his wife lived with him for a
    long time. Afterwards the man lived with Thornton Walton. The
    man was hauling lumber from Columbia. He was taken from his team
    in Lancaster, and lodged in Baltimore jail. Daniel Gibbons went
    to Baltimore, visited the jail and tried hard to get him
    released, but failed. I would add here, that Daniel Gibbons'
    faithful wife, one of the best women I ever knew, was always
    ready, day or night, to do all she possibly could, to help the
    poor fugitives on their way to freedom. Many interesting
    incidents occurred at the home of my uncle. I will relate one.
    He had living with him at one time, two colored men, Thomas
    Colbert and John Stewart. The latter was from Maryland; John
    often said he would go back and get his wife. My uncle asked him
    if he was not afraid of his master's catching him. He said no,
    for his master knew if he undertook to take him, he would kill
    him. He did go and brought his wife to my uncle's.

    While these two large men, Tom and John, were there, along came
    Robert (other name unknown), in a bad plight, his feet bleeding.
    Robert was put in the barn to thrash, until he could be fixed up
    to go again on his journey. But in a few days, behold, along
    came his master. He brought with him that notorious constable,
    Haines, from Lancaster, and one other man. They came suddenly
    upon Robert; as soon as he saw them he ran and jumped out of the
    "overshoot," some ten feet down. In jumping, he put one knee out
    of joint. The men ran around the barn and seized him. By this
    time, the two colored men, Tom and John, came, together with my
    uncle and aunt. Poor Robert owned his master, but John told them
    they should not take him away, and was going at them with a
    club. One of the men drew a pistol to shoot John, but uncle told
    him he had better not shoot him; this was not a slave State.
    Inasmuch as Robert had owned his master, Uncle told John he must
    submit, so they put Robert on a horse, and started with him.
    After they were gone John said: "Mr. Gibbons, just say the word,
    and I will bring Robert back." Aunt said: "Go, John, go!" So
    John ran to Joseph Rakestraw's and got a gun (without any lock),
    and ran across the fields, with Tom after him, and headed the
    party. The men all ran except Haines, who kept Robert between
    himself and John, so that John should not shoot him. But John
    called out to Robert to drop off that horse, or he would shoot
    him. This Robert did, and John and Tom brought him back in
    triumph. My aunt said: "John, thee is a good fellow, thee has
    done well." Robert was taken to Jesse Gilbert's barn, and Dr.
    Dingee fixed his knee. As soon as he was able to travel, he took
    a "bee-line" for the North star.

    My life with my uncle and aunt made me an abolitionist. I left
    them in the winter of 1824, and came to Salem, Ohio, where I
    kept a small station on the Underground Rail Road, until the
    United States government took my work away. I have helped over
    two hundred fugitives on their way to Canada.

    Respectfully,

    DANIEL BONSALL,

    Salem, Columbiana county, Ohio."


One day, in the winter of 1822, Thomas Johnson, a colored man, living
with Daniel Gibbons, went out early in the morning, to set traps for
muskrats. While he was gone, a slave-holder came to the house and
inquired for his slave. Daniel Gibbons said: "There is no slave here of
that name." The man replied: "I know he is here. The man we're after, is
a miserable, worthless, thieving scoundrel." "Oh! very well, then," said
the good Quaker, "if that's the kind of man thee's after, then I know he
is not here. We have a colored man here, but he is not that kind of a
man." The slaveholder waited awhile, the man not making his appearance,
then said: "Well, now, Mr. Gibbons, when you see that man next, tell him
that we were here, and if he will come home, we will take good care of
him, and be kind to him." "Very well," said Daniel, "I will tell him
what thee says, but say to him at the same time, that he is a very great
fool, if he does as thee requests." The colored man sought, having
caught sight of the slaveholders, and knowing who they were, went off
that night, under Daniel Gibbons' directions, and was never seen by his
master again. Afterward, Daniel and his nephew, William Gibbons, went
with this man to Adams county. With his master came the master of Mary,
a girl with straight hair, and nearly white, who lived with Daniel
Gibbons and his wife. Poor Mary was unfortunate. Her master caught her,
and took her back with him into Slavery. She and a little girl, who was
taken away about the year 1830, were the only ones ever taken back from
the house of Daniel Gibbons.

Between the time of his marriage, when he began to keep a depot on the
Underground Rail Road, and the year 1824, he passed more than one
hundred slaves through to Canada, and between the latter time and his
death, eight hundred more, making, in all nine hundred aided by him. He
was ever willing to sacrifice his own personal comfort and convenience,
in order to assist fugitives. In 1833, when on his way to the West, in a
carriage, with his friend, Thomas Peart, also a most faithful friend of
the colored man and interested in Underground Rail Road affairs, he
found a fugitive slave, a woman, in Adams county, who was in immediate
danger. He stopped his journey, and sent his horse and wagon back to his
own home with the woman, that being the only safe way of getting her
off. This was but a sample of his self-denial, in the cause of human
freedom.

His want of ability to guide in person runaway slaves, or to travel with
them, prevented him from taking active part in the wonderful adventures
and hair-breadth escapes which his brain and tact rendered possible and
successful. It is believed that no slave was ever recaptured that
followed his directions. Sometimes the abolitionists were much annoyed
by impostors, who pretended to be runaways, in order to discover their
plans, and betray them to the slave-holders. Daniel Gibbons was
possessed of much acuteness in detecting these people, but having
detected them, he never treated them harshly or unkindly.

Almost from infancy, he was distinguished for the gravity of his
deportment, and his utter heedlessness of small things. The writer has
heard men preach the doctrine of the trifling value of the things of a
present time, and of the tremendous importance of those of a
never-ending eternity, but Daniel Gibbons is the only person she ever
knew, who lived that doctrine. He believed in plainness of apparel as
taught by Friends, not as a form or a rule of society, but as a
principle; often quoting from some one who said that "the adornment of a
vain and foolish world, would feed a starving one." He opposed
extravagant fashions and all luxury of habit and life, as calculated to
produce effeminacy and degrading sensuality, and as a bestowal of
idolatrous attention upon that body which he would often say "was here
but for a short time."

Looking only upon that as religion, which made men love each other and
do good to each other in this world, he was little of a stickler for
points of belief, and even when he did look into theological matters or
denounce a man's religious opinions, it was generally because they were
calculated to darken the mind and be entertained as a substitute for
good works. Pursuing the even tenor of his way, he could as easily lead
the flying fugitive slave by night out of the way of his powerful
master, as one differently constituted could bestow his wealth upon the
most popular charity in the land.

His faith was of the simplest kind--the Parable of the prodigal son,
contains his creed. Discarding what are commonly called "plans of
salvation," he believed in the light "which lighteth every man that
cometh into the world," and that if people would follow this light, they
would thus seek "the kingdom of Heaven and its righteousness and all
other things needful would be added thereunto." He was a devoted member
of the Society of Friends, in which he held the position of elder,
during the last twenty-five years of his life. That peculiar doctrine of
the Society, which repudiates systematic divinity and with it a paid
ministry, he held in special reverence, finding confirmation of its
truth in the general advocacy of Slavery, by the popular clergy of his
day.

When he was quite advanced in years, and the Anti-slavery agitation grew
warm, he was solicited to join an anti-slavery society, but on hearing
the constitution read, and finding that it repudiated all use of
physical force on the part of the oppressed in gaining their liberty, he
said that he could not assent to that--that he had long been engaged in
getting off slaves, and that he had always advised them to use force,
although remonstrating against going to the extent of taking life, and
that now he could not recede from that position, and he did not see how
they could always be got off without the use of some force.

His faith in an overruling Providence was complete. He believed, even in
the darkest days of freedom in our land, in the ultimate extinction of
Slavery, and at times, although advanced in years, thought he would live
to witness that glorious consummation. It is only in a man's own family
and by his wife and children, that he is really known, and it is by
those who best knew, and indeed, who only knew this good man, that his
biographer is most anxious that he should be judged. As a parent, he was
not excessively indulgent, as a husband, one more nearly a model is
rarely found. But his kindness in domestic life, his love for his wife,
his son and his grandchildren, and their reciprocal love and affection
for him, no words can express.

It was in his father's household in his youth and in his own household
in his mature years, that was fostered that wealth of love and
affection, which, extending and widening, took in the whole race, and
made him the friend of the oppressed everywhere, and especially of those
whom it was a dangerous and unpopular task to befriend.

The tenderness and thoughtfulness of his disposition are well shown in
the following incident: Upon one occasion, his son received a kick from
a horse, which he was about to mount at the door. When he had recovered
from the shock, and it was found that he was not seriously injured, the
father still continued to look serious, and did not cease to shed tears.
On being asked why he grieved, his answer was: "I was just thinking how
it would have been with thee, had that stroke proved fatal." Such
thoughts were at once the notes of his own preparation and a warning to
others to be also ready.

A life consistent with his views, was a life of humility and universal
benevolence, and such was his. It was a life, as it were in Heaven,
while yet on earth, for it soared above and beyond the corrupt and
slavish influences of earthly passions.

His interest in temperance never failed him. On his death-bed he would
call persons to him, who needed such advice, and admonish them on the
subject of using strong drinks, and his last expression of interest in
any humanitarian movement, was an avowal of his belief in the great good
to arise from a prohibitory liquor law.

To a friend, who entered his sick room, a few days before his death, he
said: "Well, E., thee is preparing to go to the West." The friend
replied: "Yes, and Daniel, I suppose thee is preparing to go to
eternity." There was an affirmative reply, and E. inquired, "How does
thee find it?" Daniel said: "I don't find much to do, I find that I have
not got a hard master to deal with. Some few things which I have done, I
find not entirely right." He quitted the earthly service of the Master,
on the 17th day of the eighth month, 1852.

A young physician, son of one of his old friends, after attending his
funeral, wrote to a friend, as follows: "To quote the words of Webster,
'We turned and paused, and joined our voices with the voices of the air,
and bade him hail! and farewell!' Farewell, kind and brave old man! The
voices of the oppressed whom thou hast redeemed, welcome thee to the
Eternal City."



LUCRETIA MOTT.


Of all the women who served the Anti-slavery cause in its darkest days,
there is not one whose labors were more effective, whose character is
nobler, and who is more universally respected and beloved, than Lucretia
Mott. You cannot speak of the slave without remembering her, who did so
much to make Slavery impossible. You cannot speak of freedom, without
recalling that enfranchised spirit, which, free from all control, save
that of conscience and God, labored for absolute liberty for the whole
human race. We cannot think of the partial triumph of freedom in this
country, without rejoicing in the great part she took in the victory.
Lucretia Mott is one of the noblest representatives of ideal womanhood.
Those who know her, need not be told this, but those who only love her
in the spirit, may be sure that they can have no faith too great in the
beauty of her pure and Christian life.

This book would be incomplete without giving some account, however
brief, of Lucretia Mott's character and labors in the great work to
which her life has been devoted. To write it fully would require a
volume. She was born in 1793, in the island of Nantucket, and is
descended from the Coffins and Macys, on the father's side, and from the
Folgers, on the mother's side, and through them is related to Dr.
Benjamin Franklin. Her maiden name was Lucretia Coffin.

During the absence of her father on a long voyage, her mother was
engaged in mercantile business, purchasing goods in Boston, in exchange
for oil and candles, the staples of the island. Mrs. Mott says in
reference to this employment: "The exercise of women's talent in this
line, as well as the general care which devolved upon them in the
absence of their husbands, tended to develop their intellectual powers,
and strengthened them mentally and physically."

The family removed to Boston in 1804. Her parents belonged to the
religious Society of Friends, and carefully cultivated in their
children, the peculiarities as well as the principles of that sect. To
this early training, we may ascribe the rigid adherence of Mrs. Mott, to
the beautiful but sober costume of the Society.

When in London, in 1840, she visited the Zoological Gardens, and a
gentleman of the party, pointing out the splendid plumage of some
tropical birds, remarked: "You see, Mrs. Mott, our heavenly Father
believes in bright colors. How much it would take from our pleasure, if
all the birds were dressed in drab." "Yes;" she replied, "but immortal
beings do not depend upon feathers for their attractions. With the
infinite variety of the human face and form, of thought, feeling and
affection, we do not need gorgeous apparel to distinguish us. Moreover,
if it is fitting that woman should dress in every color of the rainbow,
why not man also? Clergymen, with their black clothes and white cravats,
are quite as monotonous as the Quakers." Whatever may be the abstract
merit of this argument, it is certain that the simplicity of Lucretia
Mott's nature, is beautifully expressed by her habitual costume.

In giving the principal events of Lucretia Mott's life, we prefer to use
her own language whenever possible. In memoranda furnished by her to
Elizabeth Cady Stanton, she says: "My father had a desire to make his
daughters useful. At fourteen years of age, I was placed, with a younger
sister, at the Friends' Boarding School, in Dutchess county, State of
New York, and continued there for more than two years, without returning
home. At fifteen, one of the teachers leaving the school, I was chosen
as an assistant in her place. Pleased with the promotion, I strove hard
to give satisfaction, and was gratified, on leaving the school, to have
an offer of a situation as teacher if I was disposed to remain; and
informed that my services should entitle another sister to her
education, without charge. My father was at that time, in successful
business in Boston, but with his views of the importance of training a
woman to usefulness, he and my mother gave their consent to another year
being devoted to that institution." Here is another instance of the
immeasurable value of wise parental influence.

In 1809 Lucretia joined her family in Philadelphia, whither they had
removed. "At the early age of eighteen," she says, "I married James
Mott, of New York--an attachment formed while at the boarding-school."
Mr. Mott entered into business with her father. Then followed commercial
depressions, the war of 1812, the death of her father, and the family
became involved in difficulties. Mrs. Mott was again obliged to resume
teaching. "These trials," she says, "in early life, were not without
their good effect in disciplining the mind, and leading it to set a just
estimate on worldly pleasures."

To this early training, to the example of a noble father and excellent
mother, to the trials which came so quickly in her life, the rapid
development of Mrs. Mott's intellect is no doubt greatly due. Thus the
foundation was laid, which has enabled her, for more than fifty years,
to be one of the great workers in the cause of suffering humanity. These
are golden words which we quote from her own modest notes: "I, however,
always loved the good, in childhood desired to do the right, and had no
faith in the generally received idea of human depravity." Yes, it was
because she believed in human virtue, that she was enabled to accomplish
such a wonderful work. She had the inspiration of faith, and entered her
life-battle against Slavery with a divine hope, and not with a gloomy
despair.

The next great step in Lucretia Mott's career, was taken at the age of
twenty-five, when, "summoned by a little family and many cares, I felt
called to a more public life of devotion to duty, and engaged in the
ministry in our Society."

In 1827 when the Society was divided Mrs. Mott's convictions led her "to
adhere to the sufficiency of the light within us, resting on the truth
as authority, rather than 'taking authority for truth.'" We may find no
better place than this to refer to her relations to Christianity. There
are many people who do not believe in the progress of religion. They are
right in one respect. God's truth cannot be progressive because it is
absolute, immutable and eternal. But the human race is struggling up to
a higher comprehension of its own destiny and of the mysterious purposes
of God so far as they are revealed to our finite intelligence. It is in
this sense that religion is progressive. The Christianity of this age
ought to be more intelligent than the Christianity of Calvin. "The
popular doctrine of human depravity," says Mrs. Mott, "never commended
itself to my reason or conscience. I searched the Scriptures daily,
finding a construction of the text wholly different from that which was
pressed upon our acceptance. The highest evidence of a sound faith being
the practical life of the Christian, I have felt a far greater interest
in the moral movements of our age than in any theological discussion."
Her life is a noble evidence of the sincerity of this belief. She has
translated Christian principles into daily deeds.

That spirit of benevolence which Mrs. Mott possesses in a degree far
above the average, of necessity had countless modes of expression. She
was not so much a champion of any particular cause as of all reforms. It
was said of Charles Lamb that he could not even hear the devil abused
without trying to say something in his favor, and with all Mrs. Mott's
intense hatred of Slavery we do not think she ever had one unkind
feeling toward the slave-holder. Her longest, and probably her noblest
work, was done in the anti-slavery cause. "The millions of down-trodden
slaves in our land," she says, "being the greatest sufferers, the most
oppressed class, I have felt bound to plead their cause, in season and
out of season, to endeavor to put my soul in their soul's stead, and to
aid, all in my power, in every right effort for their immediate
emancipation." When in 1833, Wm. Lloyd Garrison took the ground of
immediate emancipation and urged the duty of unconditional liberty
without expatriation, Mrs. Mott took an active part in the movement. She
was one of the founders of the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society
in 1834. "Being actively associated in the efforts for the slave's
redemption," she says, "I have traveled thousands of miles in this
country, holding meetings in some of the slave states, have been in the
midst of mobs and violence, and have shared abundantly in the odium
attached to the name of an uncompromising modern abolitionist, as well
as partaken richly of the sweet return of peace attendant on those who
would 'undo the heavy burdens and let the oppressed go free, and break
every yoke.'" In 1840 she attended the World's Anti-Slavery Convention
in London. Because she was a woman she was not admitted as a delegate.
All the female delegates, however, were treated with courtesy, though
not with justice. Mrs. Mott spoke frequently in the liberal churches of
England, and her influence outside of the Convention had great effect on
the Anti-Slavery movement in Great Britain.

But the value of Mrs. Mott's anti-slavery work is not limited to what
she individually did, great as that labor was. Her influence over
others, and especially the young, was extraordinary. She made many
converts, who went forth to spread the great ideas of freedom throughout
the land. No one can of himself accomplish great good. He must labor
through others, he must inspire them, convince the unbelieving, kindle
the fires of faith in doubting souls, and in the unequal fight of Right
with Wrong make Hope take the place of despair. This Lucretia Mott has
done. Her example was an inspiration.

In the Temperance reform Mrs. Mott took an early interest, and for many
years she has practiced total abstinence from intoxicating drinks. In
the cause of Peace she has been ever active, believing in the "ultra
non-resistance ground, that no Christian can consistently uphold and
actively engage in and support a government based on the sword." Yet
this, we believe, did not prevent her from taking a profound interest in
the great war for the Union; though she deplored the means, her soul
must have exulted in the result. Through anguish and tears, blood and
death America wrought out her salvation. Do we not believe that the
United States leads the cause of human freedom? It follows then that the
abolition of the gigantic system of human slavery in this country is the
grandest event in modern history. Mrs. Mott has also been earnestly
engaged in aid of the working classes, and has labored effectively for
"a radical change in the system which makes the rich richer, and the
poor poorer." In the Woman's Rights question she was early interested,
and with Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, she organized, in 1848, a Woman's
Rights' Convention at Seneca Falls, New York. At the proceedings of this
meeting, "the nation was convulsed with laughter." But who laughs now at
this irresistible reform?

The public career of Lucretia Mott is in perfect harmony with her
private life. "My life in the domestic sphere," she says, "has passed
much as that of other wives and mothers of this country. I have had six
children. Not accustomed to resigning them to the care of a nurse, I was
much confined to them during their infancy and childhood."
Notwithstanding her devotion to public matters her private duties were
never neglected. Many of our readers will no doubt remember Mrs. Mott at
Anti-slavery meetings, her mind intently fixed upon the proceedings,
while her hands were as busily engaged in useful sewing or knitting. It
is not our place to inquire too closely into this social circle, but we
may say that Mrs. Mott's history is a living proof that the highest
public duties may be reconciled with perfect fidelity to private
responsibilities. It is so with men, why should it be different with
women?

In her marriage, Mrs. Mott was fortunate. James Mott was a worthy
partner for such a woman. He was born in June, 1788, in Long Island. He
was an anti-slavery man, almost before such a thing as anti-slavery was
known. In 1812 he refused to use any article which was produced by slave
labor. The directors of that greatest of all railway corporations, the
Underground Rail Road, will never forget his services. He died, January
26, 1868, having nearly completed his 80th year. "Not only in regard to
Slavery," said the "Philadelphia Morning Post," at the time, "but in all
things was Mr. Mott a reformer, and a radical, and while his principles
were absolute, and his opinions uncompromising, his nature was
singularly generous and humane. Charity was not to him a duty, but a
delight; and the benevolence, which, in most good men, has some touch of
vanity or selfishness, always seemed in him pure, unconscious and
disinterested. His life was long and happy, and useful to his
fellow-men. He had been married for fifty-seven years, and none of the
many friends of James and Lucretia Mott, need be told how much that
union meant, nor what sorrow comes with its end in this world." Mary
Grew pronounced his fitting epitaph when she said: "He was ever calm,
steadfast, and strong in the fore front of the conflict."

In her seventy-ninth year, the energy of Lucretia Mott is undiminished,
and her soul is as ardent in the cause to which her life has been
devoted, as when in her youth she placed the will of a true woman
against the impotence of prejudiced millions. With the abolition of
Slavery, and the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, her greatest
life-work ended. Since then, she has given much of her time to the
Female Suffrage movement, and so late as November, 1871, she took an
active part in the Annual Meeting of the Pennsylvania Peace Society.

Since the great law was enacted, which made all men, black or white,
equal in political rights--as they were always equal in the sight of
God--Mrs. Mott has made it her business to visit every colored church in
Philadelphia. This we may regard as the formal closing of fifty years of
work in behalf of a race which she has seen raised from a position of
abject servitude, to one higher than that of a monarch's throne. But
though she may have ended this Anti-slavery work, which is but the
foundation of the destiny of the colored race in America, her influence
is not ended--_that_ cannot die; it must live and grow and deepen, and
generations hence the world will be happier and better that Lucretia
Mott lived and labored for the good of all mankind.



JAMES MILLER McKIM.


More vividly than it is possible for the pen to portray, the subject of
this sketch recalls the struggles of the worst years of Slavery, when
the conflict was most exciting and interesting, when more minds were
aroused, and more laborers were hard at work in the field; when more
anti-slavery speeches were made, tracts, papers, and books, were
written, printed and distributed; when more petitions were signed for
the abolition of Slavery; in a word, when the barbarism of Slavery was
more exposed and condemned than ever before, in the same length of time.
Abolitionists were then intensely in earnest, and determined never to
hold their peace or cease their warfare, until _immediate_ and
_unconditional_ emancipation was achieved.

On the other hand, during this same period, it is not venturing too much
to assert that the slave power was more oppressive than ever before;
slave enactments more cruel; the spirit of Slavery more intolerant; the
fetters more tightly drawn; perilous escapes more frequent; slave
captures and slave hunts more appalling; in short, the enslavers of the
race had never before so defiantly assumed that negro Slavery was
sanctioned by the Divine laws of God.

Thus, while these opposing agencies were hotly contesting the rights of
man, James Miller McKim, as one of the earliest, most faithful, and
ablest abolitionists in Pennsylvania, occupied a position of influence,
labor and usefulness, scarcely second to Mr. Garrison.

For at least fourteen of the eventful years referred to, it was the
writer's privilege to occupy a position in the Anti-slavery office with
Mr. McKim, and the best opportunity was thus afforded to observe him
under all circumstances while battling for freedom. As a helper and
friend of the fleeing bondman, in numberless instances the writer has
marked well his kind and benevolent spirit, before and after the
formation of the late Vigilance Committee. At all times when the funds
were inadequate, his aid could be counted upon for sure relief. He never
failed the fugitive in the hour of need. Whether on the Underground Rail
Road bound for Canada, or before a United States commissioner trying a
fugitive case, the slave found no truer friend than Mr. McKim.

If the records of the Pennsylvania Society for Promoting the Abolition
of Slavery, and the Pennsylvania Anti-slavery Society were examined and
written out by a pen, as competent as Mr. McKim's, two or three volumes
of a most thrilling, interesting, and valuable character could be
furnished to posterity. But as his labors have been portrayed for these
pages, by a hand much more competent than the writer's, it only remains
to present it as follows:

The subject of this sketch was born in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, November
14, 1810, the oldest but one of eight children. On his father's side, he
was of Scotch Irish, on his mother's (Miller) of German descent. He
graduated at Dickinson College in 1828; and entering upon the study of
medicine, attended one or more courses of lectures in the University of
Pennsylvania. Before he was ready to take his degree, his mind was
powerfully turned towards religion, and he relinquished medicine for the
study of divinity, entering the Theological Seminary at Princeton, in
the fall of 1831, and a year later, being matriculated at Andover. The
death of his parents, however, and subsequently that of his oldest
brother, made his connection with both these institutions a very brief
one, and he was obliged, as the charge of the family now devolved upon
him, to continue his studies privately at home, under the friendly
direction of the late Dr. Duffield. An ardent and pronounced disciple of
the "New School" of Presbyterians, belonging to a strongly Old School
Presbytery; he was able to secure license and ordination only by
transfer to another; and, in October, 1835, he accepted a pulpit in
Womelsdorf, Berks County, Pa., where he preached for one year, to a
Presbyterian congregation, to what purpose, and with what views, may be
learned from the following passage taken from one of his letters,
written more than twenty years afterwards, to the _National Anti-Slavery
Standard_. "The first settled pastor of this little flock was one
sufficiently well-known to such of your readers as will be interested in
this, to make mention of his name unnecessary. He had studied for the
ministry with a strong desire, and a half formed purpose to become a
missionary in foreign lands. Before he had proceeded far in his studies,
however, he became alive to the claims of the 'perishing heathen' here
at home. When he received his licensure, his mind was divided between
the still felt impulse of his first purpose and the pressure of his
later convictions. While yet unsettled on this point, the case of the
little church at Womelsdorf was made known to him, followed by an urgent
request from the people and from the Home Missionary Society to take
charge of it. He acceded to the request and remained there one year,
zealously performing the duties of his office to the best of his
knowledge and ability. The people, earnest and simple-hearted, desired
the 'sincere milk of the Word,' and receiving it 'grew thereby.' All the
members of the church became avowed abolitionists. They showed their
faith by their works, contributing liberally to the funds of the
Anti-slavery Society. Many a seasonable donation has our Pennsylvania
organization received from that quarter. For though their anti-slavery
minister had left and had been followed by others of different
sentiments and though he had withdrawn from the church with which they
were in common connected, and that on grounds which subjected him to the
imputation and penalties af heresy, these good people did not feel
called upon to change their relations of personal friendship, nor did
they make it a pretext, as others have done, for abandoning the cause."

In October, 1836, he accepted a lecturing agency under the American
Anti-slavery Society, as one of the "seventy," gathered from all
professions, whom Theodore D. Weld had by his eloquence inspired to
spread the gospel of emancipation. Mr. McKim had long before this had
his attention drawn to the subject of slavery, in the summer of 1832;
and the reading of Garrison's "Thoughts on Colonization," at once made
him an abolitionist. He was an appointed delegate to the Convention
which formed the American Anti-slavery Society, and enjoyed the
distinction of being the youngest member of that body.[A] Henceforth the
object of the society, and of his ministry became inseparable in his
mind.

[Footnote A: It may be a matter of some interest to state that the
original draft of the Declaration of Sentiments adopted at this meeting,
together with the autographs of the signers, is now in the keeping of
the New York Historical Society.]

In the following summer, 1834, he delivered in Carlisle two addresses in
favor of immediate emancipation, which excited much discussion and
bitter feeling in that border community, and gained him no little
obloquy, which was of course increased when, as a lecturer, on the
regular stipend of eight dollars a week and travelling expenses,
("pocket lined with British gold" was the current charge), he traversed
his native state, among a people in the closest geographical,
commercial, and social contact with the system of slavery. His fate was
not different from that of his colleagues, in respect of interruptions
of his meetings by mob violence, personal assaults with stale eggs and
other more dangerous missiles, and a public sentiment which everywhere
encouraged and protected the rioters.

Meantime, a radical change of opinion on theological questions, led Mr.
McKim formally to sever his connection with the Presbyterian Church, and
ministry. Being now free to act without sectarian constraint, he was, in
the beginning of 1840, made Publishing Agent of the Pennsylvania
Anti-slavery Society, which caused him to settle in Philadelphia, where
he was married, in October, to Sarah A. Speakman, of Chester county. The
chief duties of his office at first, were the publication and management
of the _Pennsylvania Freeman_, including, for an interval after the
retirement of John G. Whittier, the editorial conduct of that paper. In
course of time his functions were enlarged, and under the title of
Corresponding Secretary, he performed the part of a factotum and general
manager, with a share in all the anti-slavery work, local and national.
After the consolidation of the _Freeman_ with the _Standard_, in 1854,
he became the official correspondent of the latter paper, his letters
serving to some extent as a substitute for the discontinued _Freeman_.
The operations of the Underground Rail Road came under his review and
partial control, as has already appeared in these pages, and the slave
cases which came before the courts claimed a large share of his
attention. After the passage of the Fugitive Slave Law, in 1851, his
duties in this respect were arduous and various, as may be inferred from
one of his private letters to an English friend, which found its way
into print abroad, and which will be found in another place. (See p.
581).

During the John Brown excitement Mr. McKim had the privilege of
accompanying Mrs. Brown in her melancholy errand to Harper's Ferry, to
take her last leave of her husband before his execution, and to bring
away the body. His companions on that painful but memorable journey,
were his wife, and Hector Tyndale, Esq., afterwards honorably
distinguished in the war as General Tyndale. Returning with the body of
the hero and martyr, still in company with Mrs. Brown, Mr. McKim
proceeded to North Elba, where he and Wendell Phillips, who had joined
him in New York with a few other friends gathered from the neighborhood,
assisted in the final obsequies.

When the war broke out, Mr. McKim was one of the first to welcome it as
the harbinger of the slave's deliverance, and the country's redemption.
"A righteous war," he said, "is better than a corrupt peace.  *  *  *
When war can only be averted by consenting to crime, then welcome war
with all its calamities." In the winter of 1862, after the capture of
Port Royal, he procured the calling of a public meeting of the citizens
of Philadelphia to consider and provide for the wants of the ten
thousand slaves who had been suddenly liberated. One of the results of
this meeting was the organization of the Philadelphia Port Royal Relief
Committee. By request he visited the Sea Islands, accompanied by his
daughter, and on his return made a report which served his associates as
a basis of operations, and which was republished extensively in this
country and abroad.

After the proclamation of emancipation, he advocated an early
dissolution of the anti-slavery organization, and at the May Meeting of
the American Anti-slavery Society, in 1864, introduced a proposition
looking to that result. It was favorably received by Mr. Garrison and
others, but no action was taken upon it at that time. When the question
came up the following year, the proposition to disband was earnestly
supported by Mr. Garrison, Mr. Quincy, Mr. May, Mr. Johnson, and others,
but was strongly opposed by Wendell Phillips and his friends, among whom
from Philadelphia were Mrs. Mott, Miss Grew, and Robert Purvis, and was
decided by a vote in the negative.

Mr. McKim was an early advocate of colored enlistments, as a means of
lifting up the blacks and putting down the rebellion. In the spring of
1863, he urged upon the Philadelphia Union League, of which he was a
member, the duty of recruiting colored soldiers; as the result, on
motion of Thomas Webster, Esq., a movement was set on foot which led to
the organization of the Philadelphia Supervisory Committee, and the
subsequent establishment of Camp William Penn, with the addition to the
national army, of eleven colored regiments.

When, in November, 1863, the Port Royal Relief Committee was enlarged
into the Pennsylvania Freedman's Relief Association, Mr. McKim was made
its corresponding secretary. He had previously resigned his place in the
Anti-slavery Society, believing that that organization was near the end
of its usefulness.

In the freedmen's work, he traveled extensively, and worked hard,
establishing schools at the South and organizing public sentiment in the
free States. In the spring of 1865, he was made corresponding secretary
of the American Freedman's Commission, which he had helped to establish,
and took up his residence in the city of New York. This association was
afterwards amplified, in name and scope, into the American Freedman's
Union Commission, and Mr. McKim continued with it as corresponding
secretary, laboring for reconstruction by means of Freedman's schools,
and impartial popular education. On the 1st of July, 1869, the
Commission, by unanimous vote on his motion, disbanded, and handed over
the funds in its treasury to its constituent State associations. Mr.
McKim retired from his labors with impaired health, and has since taken
no open part in public affairs. He is one of the proprietors of the New
York _Nation_, in the establishment of which, he took an effective
interest.

Mr. McKim's long and assiduous career in the anti-slavery cause, has
given evidence of a peculiar fitness in him for the functions he
successively discharged. His influence upon men and the times, has been
less as a speaker, than as a writer, and perhaps still less as a writer
than as an organizer, a contriver of ways and means; fertile in
invention, prepared to take the initiative, and bringing to the
conversion of others, an earnestness of purpose and a force of language
that seldom failed of success. In an enterprise where theory and
sentiment were fully represented, and business capacity, and what is
called "practical sense," were comparatively rare, his talents were most
usefully employed; while, in periods of excitement--and when were such
wanting? his caution, sound judgment, and mental balance were qualities
hardly less needed or less important.



WILLIAM H. FURNESS, D.D.


Among the Abolitionists of Pennsylvania no man stands higher than Dr.
Furness; and no anti-slavery minister enjoys more universal respect. For
more than thirty years he bore faithful witness for the black man; in
season and out of season contending for his rights. When others deserted
the cause he stood firm; when associates in the ministry were silent he
spoke out. They defined their position by declaring themselves "as much
opposed to slavery as ever, but without sympathy for the abolitionists."
He defined his by showing himself more opposed to slavery than ever, and
fraternizing with the most hated and despised anti-slavery people.

Dr. Furness came into the cause when it was in its infancy, and had few
adherents. From that time till the day of its triumph he was one with
it, sharing in all its trials and vicissitudes. In the operations of the
Vigilance Committee he took the liveliest interest. Though not in form a
member he was one of its chief co-laborers. He brought it material aid
continually, and was one of its main reliances for outside support. His
quick sympathies were easily touched and when touched were sure to
prompt him to corresponding action. He would listen with moistened eyes
to a tale of outrage, and go away saying never a word. But the story of
wrong would work upon him; and through him upon others. His own feelings
were communicated to his friends, and his friends would send gifts to
the Committee's treasury. A wider spread sympathy would manifest itself
in the community, and the general interests of the cause be visibly
promoted. It was in the latter respect, that of moral co-operation, that
Dr. Furness's services were most valuable. After hearing a harrowing
recital, whether he would or not, it became the burden of his next
Sunday's sermon. Abundant proof of this may be found in his printed
discourses. Take the following as an illustration. It is an extract from
a sermon delivered on the 29th of May, 1854, a period when the slave
oligarchy was at the height of its power and was supported at the North
by the most violent demonstrations of sympathy. The text was, "Feed my
Lambs:"


    "And now brothers, sisters, children, give me your hearts,
    listen with a will to what I have to say. As heaven is my
    witness, I would not utter one word save for the dear love of
    Christ and of God, and the salvation of your own souls. Does it
    require any violent effort of the mind to suppose Christ to
    address each one of us personally the same question that He put
    to Peter, 'Lovest thou me?'  *  *  *  And at the hearing of His
    brief command, 'Feed my lambs,' so simple, so direct, so
    unqualified, are we prompted like the teacher of the law who,
    when Christ bade him love his neighbor as himself, asked, 'And
    who is my neighbor?' and in the parable of the good Samaritan,
    received an answer that the Samaritans whom he despised, just as
    we despise the African, was his neighbor, are we prompted in
    like manner to ask, 'Who are the lambs of Christ?' Who are His
    lambs? Behold that great multitude, more than three millions of
    men and feeble women and children, wandering on our soil; no not
    wandering, but chained down, not allowed to stir a step at their
    own free will, crushed and hunted with all the power of one of
    the mightiest nations that the world has yet seen, wielded to
    keep them down in the depths of the deepest degradation into
    which human beings can be plunged. These, then that we despise,
    are our neighbors, the poor, stricken lambs of Christ.

    To cast one thought towards them, may well cause us to bow down
    our heads in the very dust with shame. No wonder that professing
    to love Christ and his religion, we do not like to hear them
    spoken of; for so far from feeding the lambs of Christ, we are
    exciting the whole associated power of this land, to keep them
    from being fed. 'Feed my lambs,' We might feed them with
    fraternal sympathy, with hope, with freedom, the imperishable
    bread of Heaven. We might lead them into green pastures and
    still waters, into the glorious liberty wherewith Christ died to
    make all men free, the liberty of the children of God. We might
    secure to them the exercise of every sacred affection and
    faculty, wherewith the Creator has endowed them. But we do none
    of those things. We suffer this great flock of the Lord Jesus to
    be treated as chattels, bought and sold, like beasts of burden,
    hunted and lacerated by dogs and wolves. I say we, we of these
    Free Northern communities, because it is by our allowance,
    signified as effectually by silence, as by active co-operation,
    that such things are. They could continue so, scarcely an hour,
    were not the whole moral, religious and physical power of the
    North pledged to their support. Are we not in closest league and
    union with those who claim and use the right to buy and sell
    human beings, God's poor, the lambs of Christ, a union, which we
    imagine brings us in as much silver and gold as compensates for
    the sacrifice of our humanity and manhood? Nay, are we not under
    a law to do the base work of bloodhounds, hunting the panting
    fugitives for freedom? I utter no word of denunciation. There is
    no need. For facts that have occurred only within the last week,
    transcend all denunciation. Only a few hours ago, there was a
    man with his two sons, hurried back into the inhuman bondage,
    from which they had just escaped, and that man, the brother, and
    those two sons, the nephews of a colored clergyman of New York,
    of such eminence in the New School Presbyterian Church, that he
    has received the honors of a European University, and has acted
    as Moderator in one of the Presbyteries of the same Church, when
    held in the city where he resides. Almost at the very moment the
    poor fugitive with his children, were dragged through our city,
    the General Assembly of that very branch of the Presbyterian
    Church, now in session here, after discussing for days the
    validity of Roman Catholic baptism, threw out as inexpedient to
    be discussed, the subject of that great wrong which was flinging
    back into the agony of Slavery, a brother of one of their own
    ordained ministers, and could not so much as breathe a word of
    condemnation against the false and cruel deed which has just
    been consummated at the capitol of the nation.

    When such facts are occurring in the midst of us, we cannot be
    guiltless concerning the lambs of Christ. It is we, we who make
    up the public opinion of the North, we who consent that these
    free States shall be the hunting-ground, where these, our poor
    brothers and sisters, are the game; it is we that withhold from
    them the bread of life, the inalienable rights of man. As we
    withhold these blessings, so is it in our power to bestow them.
    The sheep then that Christ commands us, as we love Him, to feed,
    are those who are famishing for the lack of the food which it is
    in our power to supply. And we can help to feed and relieve and
    liberate them, by giving our hearty sympathy to the blessed
    cause of their emancipation, to the abolition of the crying
    injustice with which they are treated, by uttering our earnest
    protest against the increasing and flagrant outrages of the
    oppressor, by withholding all aid and countenance from the work
    of oppression."


To say that Dr. Furness, in his pleadings for the slave, was "instant in
season and out of season," is not to exaggerate. So palpably was this
true, that even some of his sympathizing friends intimated to him, that
his zeal carried him beyond proper bounds, and that his discourses were
needlessly reiterative. To these friends,--who, it is needless to say,
did not fully comprehend the breadth and bearing of the question,--he
would reply as he did in the following extract from a sermon delivered
soon after the one above quoted:


    "Again and again, I have had it said to me, with apparently the
    most perfect simplicity, 'Why do you keep saying so much about
    the slaves? Do you imagine that there is one among your hearers
    who does not agree with you? We all know that Slavery is very
    wrong. What, is the use of harping upon this subject Sunday
    after Sunday? We all feel about it just as you do.' 'Feel about
    it just as I do,' Very likely, my friends. It is very possible
    that you all feel as much, and that many of you feel about it
    more than I do. God knows that my regret always has been not
    that I feel so much, but that I do not feel more. Would to
    Heaven that neither you nor I could eat or sleep for pity, pity
    for our poor down-trodden brothers and sisters. But the thing to
    which I implore your attention now, is, not what we know and
    feel, but the delusion which we are under, in confounding
    _knowing_ with _doing_, in fancying that we are working to
    abolish Slavery because we know that it is wrong. This is what I
    would have you now to consider, the deception that we practise
    on ourselves, the dangerous error into which we fall, when we
    pass off the knowledge of our duty for the performance of it.
    These are two very distinct things. If you know what is right,
    happy are ye if ye do it.

    Observe, my friends, what it is to which I am now entreating
    your consideration. It is not the wrongs nor the rights of the
    oppressed upon which I am now discoursing. It is our own
    personal exposure to a most serious mistake. It is a danger,
    which threatens our own souls, to which I would that our eyes
    should be open and on the watch.

    And here, by the way, let me say that one great reason why I
    refer as often as I do, to that great topic of the day, which,
    in one shape or another, is continually shaking the land and
    marking the age in which we live, is not merely the righting of
    the wronged, but the instruction, the moral enlightenment, the
    religious edification of our own hearts, which this momentous
    topic affords. To me this subject involves infinitely more than
    a mere question of humanity. Its political bearing is the very
    least and most superficial part of it, scarcely worth noticing
    in comparison with its moral and religious relations. Once,
    deterred by its outside, political aspect, I shunned it as many
    do still, but the more it has pressed itself on my attention,
    the more I have considered it--the more and more manifest has it
    become to me, that it is a subject full of light and of
    guidance, of warning and inspiration for the individual soul. It
    is the most powerful means of grace and salvation appointed in
    the providence of Heaven, for the present day and generation,
    more religious than churches and Sabbaths. It is full of
    sermons. It is a perfect gospel, a whole Bible of
    mind-enlightening, heart-cleansing, soul-saving truth. How much
    light has it thrown for me on the page of the New Testament!
    What a profound significance has it disclosed in the precepts
    and parables of Jesus Christ! How do His words burst out with a
    new meaning! How does it help us to appreciate His trials and
    the Godlike spirit with which He bore them!"


The dark winter of 1860 broke gloomily over all abolitionists; perhaps
upon none did it press more heavily, than upon the small band in
Philadelphia. Situated as that city is, upon the very edge of Slavery,
and socially bound as it was, by ties of blood or affinity with the
slave-holders of the South, to all human foresight it would assuredly be
the first theatre of bloodshed in the coming deadly struggle. As Dr.
Furness said in his sermon on old John Brown: "Out of the grim cloud
that hangs over the South, a bolt has darted, and blood has flowed, and
the place where the lightning struck, is wild with fear." The return
stroke we all felt must soon follow, and Philadelphia, we feared, would
be selected as the spot where Slavery would make its first mortal
onslaught, and the abolitionists there, the first victims. Dr. Furness
had taken part in the public meeting held on the day of John Brown's
execution, to offer prayers for the heroic soul that was then passing
away, and had gone with two or three others, to the rail-road station,
to receive the martyr's body, when it was brought from the gallows by
Mr. (afterwards General) Tyndale and Mr. McKim, and it was generally
feared that he and his church would receive the brunt of Slavery's first
blow. The air was thick with vague apprehension and rumor, so much so,
that some of Dr. Furness's devoted parishioners, who followed his
abolitionism but not his non-resistance, came armed to church, uncertain
what an hour might bring forth, or in what shape of mob violence or
assassination the blow would fall. Few of Dr. Furness's hearers will
forget his sermon of December 16, 1860, so full was it of prophetic
warning, and saddened by the thought of the fate which might be in store
for him and his congregation. It was printed in the "Evening Bulletin,"
and made a deep impression on the public outside of his own church, and
was reprinted in full, in the Boston "Atlas."


    "But the trouble cannot be escaped. It must come. But we can put
    it off. By annihilating free speech; by forbidding the utterance
    of a word in the pulpit and by the press, for the rights of man;
    by hurling back into the jaws of oppression, the fugitive
    gasping for his sacred liberty; by recognizing the right of one
    man to buy and sell other men; by spreading the blasting curse
    of despotism over the whole soil of the nation, you may allay
    the brutal frenzy of a handful of southern slave-masters; you
    may win back the cotton States to cease from threatening you
    with secession, and to plant their feet upon your necks, and so
    evade the trouble that now menaces us. Then you may live on the
    few years that are left you, and perhaps--it is not certain--we
    may be permitted to make a little more money and die in our
    beds. But no, friends, I am mistaken. We cannot put the trouble
    off. Or, we put it off in its present shape, only that it may
    take another and more terrible form. If, to get rid of the
    present alarm, we concede all that makes it worth while to
    live--and nothing less will avail--perhaps those who can
    deliberately make such a concession, will not feel the
    degradation, but, stripped of all honor and manhood, they may
    eat as heartily and sleep as soundly as ever. But the
    degradation is not the less, but the greater, for our
    unconsciousness of it. The trouble which we shall then bring
    upon ourselves, is a trouble in comparison with which the loss
    of all things but honor is a glorious gain, and a violent death
    for right's sake on the scaffold, or by the hands of a mob,
    peace and joy and victory.

    Since we are thus placed, and there is no alternative for us of
    the free States, but to meet the trouble that is upon us, or by
    base concessions and compromises to bring upon ourselves a far
    greater trouble, in the name of God, let us let all things go,
    and cleave to the right. Prepared to confront the crisis like
    men, let us with all possible calmness endeavor to take the
    measure of the calamity that we dread. God knows I have no
    desire to make light of it. But I affirm, that never since the
    world began, was there a grander cause for which to speak, to
    suffer and to die, than the cause of these free States, as
    against that of the States now rushing upon Secession. The great
    grievance of which they complain, is nothing more nor less than
    this: that we endanger the right they claim to treat human
    beings as beasts of burden. And they maintain this monstrous
    claim by measures inhuman and barbarous, listening not to the
    voice of reason or humanity, but treating every man who goes
    amongst them, suspected of not favoring their cause, or of the
    remotest connection with others who do not favor it, with a most
    savage and fiendish cruelty. It is the conflict between
    barbarism and civilization, between liberty and the most
    horrible despotism that ever cursed this earth, in which we are
    called to take part.

    And all that is great and noble in the past, all the patriots
    and martyrs that have suffered in man's behalf, all the sacred
    instincts and hopes of the human soul are on our side, and the
    welfare of untold generations of men. Oh, if God, in his
    infinite bounty, grants us the grace to appreciate the
    transcendent worth of the cause which is now at stake, there is
    no trouble that can befall us, no, not the loss of property, of
    idolized parents or children, or life itself, that we shall not
    count a blessed privilege. To serve this dear cause of peace and
    liberty and love, we have no need to grasp the sword or any
    instrument of violence and death. But we must be ready without
    flinching, to confront the utmost that men can do, and amidst
    all the uproar and violence of human passions, still calmly to
    assert and to exercise our sacred and inalienable liberties, let
    who will frown and forbid, assured that no just and
    law-of-God-abiding people, will ever do otherwise than give us
    their sympathy and their aid.

    Death is the worst that can befall us, if so be that we are
    faithful to the right. It is a solemn and a fearful thing to
    die, and mortality shrinks from facing that last great mystery.
    But we must all die, my friends, and the dying hour is not far
    distant from the youngest of us. To most of us it is very near.
    To many, only a few brief years remain. And for the sake of
    these few and uncertain years, shall we push off this present
    trouble upon our children, who have to stay here a little
    longer? There is nothing that can so sweeten the bitter cup of
    mortality when we shall be called to drink it, nothing that can
    so cheer us in the prospect of parting from all we love, nothing
    that can send such a blessed light on before us into the dark
    valley which we must enter, as the consciousness of fidelity to
    man and to God. And now in these times of great trouble which
    have come upon us, we have a peculiar and special opportunity of
    testifying our fidelity, and of enjoying a full experience of
    its power to support us. We may gather from this trouble, a
    sweetness that shall take away from all suffering its
    bitterness. We may kindle that light in our bosoms, which shall
    make death come to us as a radiant angel."


Four months after the above was uttered, on the 28th of April, 1861,
after the attack on Fort Sumter, and the whole North had burst into a
flame, people of all denominations flocked to Dr. Furness's church, as
to that church which had shown that it was founded on a rock, and none
can ever forget the long-drawn breath with which the sermon began: "The
long agony is over!" It was the _"Te Deum_" of a life-time.

Dr. Furness's words and counsels were not wanting throughout the war,
and his sermons were constantly printed in the daily press and in
separate pamphlet form. And since its close he has continued his
absorbing study of the historical accounts of Jesus.

Dr. Furncss was born in Boston, in April, 1802, and was graduated at
Harvard, in 1820, and five years later became the minister of the First
Congregational Unitarian Christians, in this city, and is consequently
the senior clergyman, here, on the score of length of pastorate.

Happy is the man, and enviable the gospel minister, who, looking back
upon his course in the great anti-slavery contest, can recall as the
chief charge brought against him, that of being over-zealous! That he
spoke too often and said too much in favor of the slave! There are but
few men, and still fewer ministers, who have a right to take comfort
from such recollections! and yet it is to this small class that the
cause is most indebted under God, for its triumph, and the country for
its deliverance from Slavery.



WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON.


The character and career of the leader of the movement for immediate
emancipation in this country, are too well known to be dwelt on here;
nor, in the space at our command, is it possible to give in full those
facts of his life which have already appeared in print. His earliest
biographer was Mary Howitt; and another even more famous authoress, Mrs.
H.B. Stowe, in "Men of Our Times," has stood in the same relation to
him, while his life-long friend, Oliver Johnson, has writen the best
concise account of him, in "Appleton's New American Cyclopædia."

Mr. Garrison (the Cyclopædia is, on this point, in error) was born
December 12, 1804, in Newburyport, Mass., his father, Abijah Garrison,
being a ship-captain, trading with the West Indies, and his mother,
Fanny Lloyd, a woman of remarkable beauty, as well as piety and force of
character. Intemperate habits led the husband and father from home to a
solitary and obscure end, leaving his family entirely dependent. William
(or as he was always called, Lloyd), was the youngest but one of five
children, and had not done with his schooling before he began to
contribute to his own support; at first in Lynn, where he was set at
shoemaking, at the age of eleven; afterwards in Newburyport, and
finally, in 1818, at Haverhill, where he was apprenticed to a cabinet
maker. Not finding these trades suited to his taste, the same year he
was indentured to Ephraim W. Allen, editor of the "_Newburyport
Herald_," and in the printing-office he completed his education, so far
as he was to have any, with such early success, as soon to be an
acceptable contributor to his employer's paper, while the authorship of
his articles was still his own secret. As soon as his apprenticeship
came to a close, in 1826, he became proprietor of the "_Free Press_," in
his native city, but the paper failed of support. Seeking work as a
journeyman, in Boston, he was engaged in 1827 to edit, in the interest
of "total abstinence," the "_National Philanthropist,"_ the first paper
of its kind ever published. On a change of proprietors in 1828, he was
induced to join a friend in Bennington, Vt., in publishing the "_Journal
of the Times_," which advocated the election of John Quincy Adams for
president, besides being devoted to peace, temperance, anti-slavery and
other reforms. In this town, Mr. Garrison began his agitation of the
subject of Slavery, "in consequence of which there was transmitted to
Congress an anti-slavery memorial, more numerously signed than any
similar paper previously submitted to that body." It was in Bennington,
too, that he received from Benjamin Lundy, who had met him the previous
year at his boarding-house in Boston, an invitation to go to Baltimore,
and aid him in editing the "_Genius of Universal Emancipation_."

Baltimore was no strange city to Mr. Garrison. Thither he had
accompanied his mother, in 1815, serving as a chore-boy, and he had
visited her just before her death, in 1823. He took leave of Boston in
the fall of 1829, after having acted as the orator of the day, July 4th,
in Park Street church, and surprised his hearers by the boldness of his
utterances on the subject of Slavery. The causes of his imprisonment at
Baltimore scarcely need to be repeated. For an alleged "gross and
malicious libel" on a townsman (of Newburyport) whose ship was engaged
in the coastwise slave-trade, and whom he accordingly denounced in the
"_Genius_," he was tried and convicted, and sentenced to pay a fine of
$50 and costs. The cell in which he was confined for forty-nine days,
and from which he was liberated only by the spontaneous liberality of
Arthur Tappan, a perfect stranger to him, he had the satisfaction of
reseeking, after the close of the war, in company with Judge Bond, but
the prison had been removed.

Compelled to part company with Lundy, to whom he has ever owned his
moral indebtedness, Mr. Garrison at length started in Boston, in January
1831, his "_Liberator_" with little else besides his "dauntless spirit
and a press." The difficulties which beset the birth of this paper were
never entirely overcome, and its publication was attended, through all
the thirty-five years of its existence, with constant struggle and
privation, and with personal labor, at the printer's case, and over the
forms, which only an iron constitution could have endured. The
"_Liberator_" was the organ of the editor alone, and he gave room in it
to the numerous reforms which were, in his mind, only subordinate to
abolition. In 1865 the last volume was issued, Mr. Garrison having
already, in May, withdrawn from the American Anti-slavery Society, which
he had helped to found, in 1833, and of which, as he drew up the
Declaration of Sentiments, he may be supposed to have known something of
the original aims and proper duration.

In September, 1834, Mr. Garrison was married to Helen Eliza, daughter of
the venerable philanthropist, George Benson, of Providence, R.I., who
had, even in the previous century, been an active member of a combined
anti-slavery and freedmen's aid society in that city. In October, 1835,
occurred the Boston riot, led by "gentlemen of property and standing,"
in which Mr. Garrison's life was imperilled, and which made him once
more familiar with the interior of a jail--this time, a place of refuge.
In 1832, he went to England, as an agent of the New England Anti-slavery
Society, to awaken English sympathy for the anti-slavery movement, and
to undeceive Clarkson and Wilberforce and their distinguished associates
as to the nature and object of the Colonization Society, as to which he
had already had occasion to undeceive himself. His mission was eminently
successful in both its aspects, and resulted in the subsequent visits of
George Thompson to this country, between whom and himself a strong
personal attachment had arisen and has ever since continued. A second
visit to England he made as a delegate to the World's Anti-slavery
Convention, in which he refused to sit after his female colleagues had
been rejected. A third visit, still in behalf of the cause, took place
in 1846. Twenty years later--the war over and Slavery abolished--he
again went abroad, to repair his health and renew old friendships, and
for the first time passed over to the Continent. In England, he was
greeted with cordial appreciation and hospitality by all classes.
Numerous public receptions of a most flattering character were given to
him, but without the effect of causing him to magnify his own merits or
to forget the honor due to his associates in the anti-slavery struggle.
At the London Breakfast, where John Bright presided, and John Stuart
Mill, the Duke of Argyll, and others spoke, he said, when called upon to
reply: "I disclaim, with all the sincerity of my soul, any special
praise for anything I have done. I have simply tried to maintain the
integrity of my soul before God, and to do my duty." In Edinburgh, the
"freedom of the city" was conferred upon him with impressive
ceremonies--he being the third American ever thus honored. In Paris he
was also received with distinction, his special mission to that city
being to attend the International Anti-slavery Convention, in the
capacity of a delegate from the American Freedman's Union Commission, of
which he was first vice-president.

The justice of the war on the part of the North, and its effect on the
fate of Slavery at the South, were never subjects of doubt in the mind
of Mr. Garrison, and he quickly recognized the force of events which had
taken from the abolitionists the helm of direction, and reunited them
with their countrymen in the irresistible flood which no man's hand
guided, and no man's hand could stay. An agitator from conviction and
not from choice, he was only too glad to lay down the heavy burden of a
life-time, and retire to well-earned repose, after such a vision of
faint hope realized as certainly no other reformer was ever blessed
with. He had lived to see the disunion which he advocated on sacred
principles, attempted by the South in the name of the sum of all
villanies; the uprising of the North; the grand career of Lincoln; the
proclamation of emancipation; the arming of the blacks--his own son
among their officers; the end of the rebellion; and the consummation of
his prayers and labors for the salvation of his country. He had taken
part in the ceremonies at the recovery of Sumter, had walked the streets
of Charleston, and received floral tokens of the gratitude of the
emancipated. To him it seemed as if his work was done, and that he
might, without suspicion or accusation, cease to be conspicuous, or to
occupy the public attention in any way relating to the past and
recalling his part in the anti-slavery struggle. Notoriety, no longer a
necessity, was eagerly avoided; and the physical rest which was now
enjoined upon him the liberality of his friends having enabled him to
secure, he settled down into the quiet life of a private citizen, whose
great duty had become to him merely one of the duties which every man
owes his country and his race. His sweet temper, his modesty, his
unfailing cheerfulness, his rarely mistaken judgment of men and
measures; his blameless and happy domestic life, and his hospitality;
his warm sympathy with all forms of human suffering--these and other
qualities which cannot be enumerated here, will doubtless receive the
just judgment of posterity.

As a fitting adjunct to the foregoing sketch, extracts from some of the
speeches made at the London breakfast so magnanimously extended to Mr.
Garrison in 1867, are here introduced. As presiding officer on the
occasion, John Bright, M.P. spoke as follows:



SPEECH OF MR. BRIGHT, M.P.



    The position in which I am placed this morning is one very
    unusual for me, and one that I find somewhat difficult; but I
    consider it a signal distinction to be permitted to take a
    prominent part in the proceedings of this day, which are
    intended to commemorate one of the greatest of the great
    triumphs of freedom, and to do honor to a most eminent
    instrument in the achievement of that freedom. (Hear, hear.)
    There may be, perhaps, those who ask what is this triumph of
    which I speak? To put it briefly, and, indeed, only to put one
    part of it, I may say that it is a triumph which has had the
    effect of raising 4,000,000 of human beings from the very lowest
    depths of social and political degradation to that lofty height
    which men have attained when they possess equality of rights in
    the first country on the globe. (Cheers.) More than this, it is
    a triumph which has pronounced the irreversible doom of slavery
    in all countries and for all time. (Renewed cheers.) Another
    question suggests itself--how has this great matter been
    accomplished? The answer suggests itself in another question.
    How is it that any great matter is accomplished? By love of
    justice, by constant devotion to a great cause, and by an
    unfaltering faith that that which is right will in the end
    succeed. (Hear, hear.)

    When I look at this hall, filled with such an assembly; when I
    partake of the sympathy which runs from heart to heart at this
    moment in welcome to our guest of to-day, I cannot but contrast
    his present position with that which, not so far back but that
    many of us can remember, he occupied in his own country. It is
    not forty years ago, I believe about the year 1829, when the
    guest whom we honor this morning was spending his solitary days
    in a prison in the slave-owning city of Baltimore. I will not
    say that he was languishing in prison, for that I do not
    believe; he was sustained by a hope that did not yield to the
    persecution of those who thus maltreated him; and to show that
    the effect of that imprisonment was of no avail to suppress or
    extinguish his ardor, within two years after that he had the
    courage, the audacity--I dare say many of his countrymen used
    even a stronger phrase than that--he had the courage to commence
    the publication, in the city of Boston, of a newspaper devoted
    mainly to the question of the abolition of slavery. The first
    number of that paper, issued on the 1st January, 1831, contained
    an address to the public, one passage of which I have often read
    with the greatest interest, and it is a key to the future life
    of Mr. Garrison. He had been complained of for having used hard
    language, which is a very common complaint indeed, and he said
    in his first number: "I am aware that many object to the
    severity of my language, but is there not cause for such
    severity? I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as
    justice. I am in earnest, I will not equivocate, I will not
    excuse, I will not retract a single inch, and I will be heard".
    (Cheers.) And that, after all, expresses to a great extent the
    future course of his life.

    But what was at that time the temper of the people amongst whom
    he lived, of the people who are glorying now, as they well may
    glory, in the abolition of slavery throughout their country? At
    that time it was very little better in the North than it was in
    the South. I think it was in the year 1835 that riots of the
    most serious character took place in some of the northern
    cities; during that time Mr. Garrison's life was in the most
    imminent peril; and he has never ascertained to this day how it
    was that he was left alive on the earth to carry on his great
    work. Turning to the South, a State that has lately suffered
    from the ravages of armies, the State of Georgia, by its
    legislature of House, Senate, and Governor, if my memory does
    not deceive me, passed a bill, offering ten thousand dollars
    reward, (Mr. Garrison here said five thousand) well, they seemed
    to think there were people who would do it cheap, (laughter)
    offered five thousand dollars, and zeal, doubtless, would make
    up the difference, for the capture of Mr. Garrison, or for
    adequate proof of his death. Now, these were menaces and perils
    such as we have not in our time been accustomed to in this
    country in any of our political movements, (hear, hear) and we
    shall take a very poor measure indeed of the conduct of the
    leaders of the emancipation party in the United States if we
    estimate them by any of those who have been concerned in
    political movements amongst us. But, notwithstanding all
    drawbacks, the cause was gathering strength, and Mr. Garrison
    found himself by and by surrounded by a small but increasing
    band of men and women who were devoted to this cause, as he
    himself was. We have in this country a very noble woman, who
    taught the English people much upon this question, about thirty
    years ago; I allude to Harriet Martineau. (Cheers.) I recollect
    well the impression with which I read a most powerful and
    touching paper which she had written, and which was published in
    the number of the _Westminster Review_ for December, 1838. It
    was entitled "The Martyr Age of the United States." The paper
    introduced to the English public the great names which were
    appearing on the scene in connection with this cause in America.
    There was, of course I need not mention, our eminent guest of
    to-day; there was Arthur Tappan, and Lewis Tappan, and James G.
    Birney of Alabama, a planter and slave-owner, who liberated his
    slaves and came north, and became, as I think, the first
    presidential candidate upon abolition principles in the United
    States. (Hear, hear.) There were besides them, Dr. Channing,
    John Quincy Adams, a statesman and President of the United
    States, and father of the eminent man who is now Minister from
    that people amongst us. (Cheers.) Then there was Wendell
    Phillips, admitted to be by all who know him perhaps the most
    powerful orator who speaks the English language. (Hear, hear.) I
    might refer to others, to Charles Sumner, the well-known
    statesman, and Horace Greeley, I think the first of journalists
    in the United States, if not the first of journalists in the
    world. (Hear, hear.) But besides these, there were of noble
    women not a few. There was Lydia Maria Child; there were the two
    sisters, Sarah and Angelina Grimke, ladies who came from South
    Carolina, who liberated their slaves, and devoted all they had
    to the service of this just cause; and Maria Weston Chapman, of
    whom Miss Martineau speaks in terms which, though I do not
    exactly recollect them, yet I know described her as
    noble-minded, beautiful and good. It may be that there are some
    of her family who are now within the sound of my voice. If it be
    so, all I have to say is, that I hope they will feel, in
    addition to all they have felt heretofore as to the character of
    their mother, that we who are here can appreciate her services,
    and the services of all who were united with her as co-operators
    in this great and worthy cause. But there was another whose name
    must not be forgotten, a man whose name must live for ever in
    history, Elijah P. Lovejoy, who in the free State of Illinois
    laid down his life for the cause. (Hear, hear.) When I read that
    article by Harriet Martineau, and the description of those men
    and women there given, I was led, I know not how, to think of a
    very striking passage which I am sure must be familiar to most
    here, because it is to be found in the Epistle to the Hebrews.
    After the writer of that epistle has described the great men and
    fathers of the nation, he says: "Time would fail me to tell of
    Gideon, of Barak, of Samson, of Jephtha, of David, of Samuel,
    and the Prophets, who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought
    righteousness, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
    quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword,
    out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight, turned
    to flight the armies of the aliens." I ask if this grand passage
    of the inspired writer may not be applied to that heroic band
    who have made America the perpetual home of freedom?
    (Enthusiastic cheering.)

    Thus, in spite of all that persecution could do, opinion grew in
    the North in favor of freedom; but in the South, alas! in favor
    of that most devilish delusion that slavery was a Divine
    institution. The moment that idea took possession of the South
    war was inevitable. Neither fact nor argument, nor counsel, nor
    philosophy, nor religion, could by any possibility affect the
    discussion of the question when once the Church leaders of the
    South had taught their people that slavery was a Divine
    institution; for then they took their stand on other and
    different, and what they in their blindness thought higher
    grounds, and they said, "Evil! be thou my good;" and so they
    exchanged light for darkness, and freedom for bondage, and good
    for evil, and, if you like, heaven for hell.  *  *  *  *

    There was a universal feeling in the North that every care
    should be taken of those who had so recently and marvellously
    been enfranchised. Immediately we found that the privileges of
    independent labor were open to them, schools were established in
    which their sons might obtain an education that would raise them
    to an intellectual position never reached by their fathers; and
    at length full political rights were conferred upon those who a
    few short years, or rather months, before, had been called
    chattels, and things to be bought and sold in any market. (Hear,
    hear.) And we may feel assured, that those persons in the
    Northern States who befriended the negro in his bondage will not
    now fail to assist his struggles for a higher position.  *  *  *
    *  *  *  *

    To Mr. Garrison more than any other man this is due; his is the
    creation of that opinion which has made slavery hateful, and
    which has made freedom possible in America. (Hear, hear.) His
    name is venerated in his own country, venerated where not long
    ago it was a name of obloquy and reproach. His name is venerated
    in this country and in Europe wheresoever Christianity softens
    the hearts and lessens the sorrows of men; and I venture to say
    that in time to come, near or remote I know not, his name will
    become the herald and the synonym of good to millions of men who
    will dwell on the now almost unknown continent of Africa. (Loud
    cheers.)  *  *  *

    To Mr. Garrison, as is stated in one of the letters which has
    just been read, to William Lloyd Garrison it has been given, in
    a manner not often permitted to those who do great things of
    this kind, to see the ripe fruit of his vast labors. Over a
    territory large enough to make many realms, he has seen hopeless
    toil supplanted by compensated industry; and where the bondman
    dragged his chain, there freedom is established for ever. (Loud
    cheers.) We now welcome him amongst us as a friend whom some of
    us have known long; for I have watched his career with no common
    interest, even when I was too young to take much part in public
    affairs; and I have kept within my heart his name, and the names
    of those who have been associated with him in every step which
    he has taken; and in public debate in the halls of peace, and
    even on the blood-soiled fields of war, my heart has always been
    with those who were the friends of freedom. (Renewed cheering.)
    We welcome him then with a cordiality which knows no stint and
    no limit for him and for his noble associates, both men and
    women.


After this eloquent and able speech by the chairman, the honor of
proposing an address to Mr. Garrison devolved upon the Duke of Argyll,
who introduced the subject in the following glowing speech:



SPEECH OF THE DUKE OF ARGYLL.



    MR. CHAIRMAN, LADIES, AND GENTLEMEN:--It is hard to follow an
    address of such extraordinary beauty, simplicity and power; but
    it now becomes my duty at your command, sir, to move an address
    of hearty congratulation to our distinguished guest, William
    Lloyd Garrison. (Cheers.) Sir, this country is from time to time
    honored by the presence of many distinguished, and of a few
    illustrious men; but for the most part we are contented to
    receive them with that private cordiality and hospitality with
    which, I trust, we shall always receive strangers who visit our
    shores. The people of this country are not pre-eminently an
    emotional people; they are not naturally fond of public
    demonstrations; and it is only upon rare occasions that we give,
    or can give, such a reception as that we see here this day.
    There must be something peculiar in the cause which a man has
    served, in the service which he has rendered, and in our own
    relations with the people whom he represents, to justify or to
    account for such a reception. (Hear, hear.) As regards the
    cause, it is not too much to say that the cause of negro
    emancipation in the United States of America has been the
    greatest cause which, in ancient or in modern times, has been
    pleaded at the bar of the moral judgment of mankind. (Cheers.) I
    know that to some this will sound as the language of exaggerated
    feeling; but I can only say that I have expressed myself in
    language which I believe conveys the literal truth. (Hear,
    hear.)

    I have, indeed, often heard it said in deprecation of the amount
    of interest which was bestowed in this country on the cause of
    negro emancipation in America, that we are apt to forget the
    forms of suffering which are immediately at our own doors, over
    which we have some control, and to express exaggerated feeling
    as to the forms of suffering with which we have nothing to do,
    and for which we are not responsible. I have never objected to
    that language in so far as it might tend to recall us to the
    duties which lie immediately around us, and in so far as it
    might tend to make us feel the forgetfulness of which we are
    sometimes guilty, of the misery and poverty in our own country;
    but, on the other hand, I will never admit, for I think it would
    be confounding great moral distinctions, that the miseries which
    arise by way of natural consequence out of the poverty and the
    vices of mankind, are to be compared with those miseries which
    are the direct result of positive law and of a positive
    institution, giving to man property in man. (Loud cheers.) It is
    true, also, that there have been forms of servitude, meaning
    thereby compulsory labor, against which we do not entertain the
    same feelings of hostility and horror with which we have
    regarded slavery in America.


           *       *       *       *       *


    It was a system of which it may be truly said, that it was twice
    cursed. It cursed him who served, and it cursed him that owned
    the slave. (Hear, hear.) When we recollect the insuperable
    temptations which that system held out to maintain in a state of
    degradation and ignorance a whole race of mankind; the horrors
    of the internal slave-trade, more widely demoralizing, in my
    opinion, than the foreign slave-trade itself; the violence which
    was done to the sanctities of domestic life; the corrupting
    effect which it was having upon the very churches of
    Christianity, when we recollect all these things, we can fully
    estimate the evil from which my distinguished friend and his
    coadjutors have at last redeemed their country. (Cheers.) It was
    not only the Slave states which were concerned in the guilt of
    slavery; it had struck its roots deep in the free States of
    North America.  *  *  *

    We honor Mr. Garrison, in the first place, for the immense pluck
    and courage he displayed. (Cheers.) Sir, you have truly said
    that there is no comparison between the contests in which he had
    to fight and the most bitter contests of our own public life. In
    looking back, no doubt, to the contest which was maintained in
    this country some thirty-five years ago against slavery in our
    colonies, we may recollect that Clarkson and Wilberforce were
    denounced as fanatics, and had to encounter much opprobrium; but
    it must not be forgotten that, so far as regards the entwining
    of the roots of slavery into the social system, in the opinions
    and interests of mankind, there was no comparison whatever
    between the circumstances of that contest here and those which
    attended it in America. (Hear, hear.) The number of persons who
    in this country were enlisted on the side of slavery by personal
    interest was always comparatively few; whilst, in attacking
    slavery at its head-quarters in the United States, Mr. Garrison
    had to encounter the fiercest passions which could be roused.  *
    *  *  *

    Thank God, Mr. Garrison appears before us as the representative
    of the United States; freedom is now the policy of the
    government and the assured policy of the country, and we can
    to-day accept and welcome Mr. Garrison, not merely as the
    liberator of the slaves, but as the representative also of the
    American Government. (Cheers.)  *  *  *  *




THE ADDRESS TO WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON, ESQ.



    "SIR:--We heartily welcome you to England in the name of
    thousands of Englishmen who have watched with admiring sympathy
    your labors for the redemption of the negro race from slavery,
    and for that which is a higher object than the redemption of any
    single race, the vindication of the universal principles of
    humanity and justice; and who, having sympathized with you in
    the struggle, now rejoice with you in the victory.

    "Forty years ago, when you commenced your efforts, slavery
    appeared to be rapidly advancing to complete ascendency in
    America. Not only was it dominant in the Southern States, but
    even in the Free States it had bowed the constituencies,
    society, and, in too many instances, even the churches to its
    will. Commerce, linked to it by interest, lent it her support. A
    great party, compactly organized and vigorously wielded, placed
    in its hands the power of the state. It bestowed political
    offices and honors, and was thereby enabled to command the
    apostate homage of political ambition. Other nations felt the
    prevalence in your national councils of its insolent and
    domineering spirit. There was a moment, most critical in the
    history of America and of the world, when it seemed as though
    that continent, with all its resources and all its hopes, was
    about to become the heritage of the slave power.

    "But Providence interposes to prevent the permanent triumph of
    evil. It interposes, not visibly or by the thunderbolt, but by
    inspiring and sustaining high moral effort and heroic lives.

    "You commenced your crusade against slavery in isolation, in
    weakness, and in obscurity. The emissaries of authority with
    difficulty found the office of the _Liberator_ in a mean room,
    where its editor was aided only by a negro boy, and supported by
    a few insignificant persons (so the officers termed them) of all
    colors. You were denounced, persecuted, and hunted down by mobs
    of wealthy men alarmed for the interests of their class. You
    were led out by one of these mobs, and saved from their violence
    and the imminent peril of death, almost by a miracle. You were
    not turned from your path of devotion to your cause, and to the
    highest interests of your country, by denunciation, persecution,
    or the fear of death. You have lived to stand victorious and
    honored in the very stronghold of slavery; to see the flag of
    the republic, now truly free, replace the flag of slavery on
    Fort Sumter; and to proclaim the doctrines of the _Liberator_ in
    the city, and beside the grave of Calhoun.

    "Enemies of war, we most heartily wish, and doubt not that you
    wish as heartily as we do, that this deliverance could have been
    wrought out by peaceful means. But the fierce passions
    engendered by slavery in the slaveowner, determined it
    otherwise; and we feel at liberty to rejoice, since the struggle
    was inevitable, that its issue has been the preservation, not
    the extinction, of all that we hold most dear. We are, however,
    not more thankful for the victories of freedom in the field than
    for the moderation and mercy shown by the victors, which have
    exalted and hallowed their cause and ours in the eyes of all
    nations.

    "We shall now watch with anxious hope the development, amidst
    the difficulties which still beset the regeneration of the
    South, of a happier order of things in the States rescued from
    slavery, and the growth of free communities, in which your name,
    with the names of your fellow-workers in the same cause, will be
    held in grateful and lasting remembrance.

    "Once more we welcome you to a country in which you will find
    many sincere admirers and warm friends."


EARL RUSSELL and JOHN STUART MILL, M.P., at the close of the address,
followed with most eloquent speeches, conferring on the honored guest
the highest praise for his life-long and successful labors in the cause
of freedom. After these gentlemen had taken their seats, the Chairman
proposed that the address should be passed unanimously.

The Chairman's call was responded to by the whole assemblage lifting up
their hands; and Mr. Garrison, presenting himself in front of the
platform, was received with an enthusiastic burst of cheering, hats and
handkerchiefs being waved by nearly all present.



SPEECH OF MR. GARRISON.



    Mr. Garrison said:--Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen,--For
    this marked expression of your personal respect, and
    appreciation of my labors in the cause of human freedom, and of
    your esteem and friendship for the land of my nativity, I offer
    you, one and all, my grateful acknowledgments. But I am so
    profoundly impressed by the formidable array of rank, genius,
    intellect, scholarship, and moral and religious worth which I
    see before me, that I fear I shall not be able to address you,
    except with a fluttering pulse and a stammering tongue. For me
    this is, indeed, an anomalous position. Assuredly, this is
    treatment with which I have not been familiar. For more than
    thirty years, I had to look the fierce and unrelenting hostility
    of my countrymen in the face, with few to cheer me onward. In
    all the South I was an outlaw, and could not have gone there,
    though an American citizen guiltless of wrong, and though that
    flag (here the speaker pointed to the United States ensign) had
    been over my head, except at the peril of my life; nay, with the
    certainty of finding a bloody grave. (Hear, hear.) In all the
    North I was looked upon with hatred and contempt. The whole
    nation, subjugated to the awful power of slavery, rose up in
    mobocratic tumult against any and every effort to liberate the
    millions held in bondage on its soil. And yet I demanded nothing
    that was not perfectly just and reasonable, in exact accordance
    with the Declaration of American Independence and the Golden
    Rule. I was not the enemy of any man living. I cherish no
    personal enmities; I know nothing of them in my heart. Even
    whilst the Southern slave-holders were seeking my destruction, I
    never for a moment entertained any other feeling toward them
    than an earnest desire, under God, to deliver them from a deadly
    curse and an awful sin. (Hear, hear.) It was neither a sectional
    nor a personal matter at all. It had exclusive reference to the
    eternal law of justice between man and man, and the rights of
    human nature itself.

    Sir, I always found in America that a shower of brickbats had a
    remarkably tonic effect, materially strengthening to the
    back-bone. (Laughter.) But, sir, the shower of compliments and
    applause, which has greeted me on this occasion would assuredly
    cause my heart to fail me, were it not that this generous
    reception is only incidentally personal to myself. (Hear, hear.)
    You, ladies and gentlemen, are here mainly to celebrate the
    triumph of humanity over its most brutal foes; to rejoice that
    universal emancipation has at last been proclaimed throughout
    the United States: and to express, as you have already done
    through the mouths of the eloquent speakers who have preceded
    me, sentiments of peace and of good-will toward the American
    Republic. Sure I am that these sentiments will be heartily
    reciprocated by my countrymen. (Cheers.)

    I must here disclaim, with all sincerity of soul, any special
    praise for anything that I have done. I have simply tried to
    maintain the integrity of my soul before God, and to do my duty.
    (Cheers.) I have refused to go with the multitude to do evil. I
    have endeavored to save my country from ruin. I have sought to
    liberate such as were held captive in the house of bondage. But
    all this I ought to have done.

    And now, rejoicing here with you at the marvellous change which
    has taken place across the Atlantic, I am unable to express the
    satisfaction I feel in believing that, henceforth, my country
    will be a mighty power for good in the world. While she held a
    seventh portion of her vast population in a state of chattelism,
    it was in vain that she boasted of her democratic principles and
    her free institutions; ostentatiously holding her Declaration of
    Independence in one hand, and brutally wielding her
    slave-driving lash in the other. Marvellous inconsistency and
    unparalleled assurance. But now, God be praised, she is free,
    free to advance the cause of liberty throughout the world. (Loud
    cheers.)

    Sir, this is not the first time I have been in England. I have
    been here three times before on anti-slavery missions; and
    wherever I traveled, I was always exultantly told, "Slaves
    cannot breathe in England!" Now, at last, I am at liberty to
    say, and I came over with the purpose to say it, "Slaves cannot
    breathe in America!" (Cheers.) And so England and America stand
    side by side in the cause of negro emancipation; and side by
    side may they stand in all that is just and noble and good,
    leading the way gloriously in the world's redemption. (Loud
    cheers.)

    I came to this country for the first time in 1833, to undeceive
    Wilberforce, Clarkson, and other eminent philanthropists, in
    regard to the real character, tendency, and object of the
    American Colonization Society. I am happy to say that I quickly
    succeeded in doing so. Before leaving, I had the pleasure of
    receiving a protest against that Society as an obstruction to
    the cause of freedom throughout the world, and, consequently, as
    undeserving of British confidence and patronage, signed by
    William Wilberforce, Thomas Fowell Buxton, Zachary Macaulay, and
    other illustrious philanthropists. On arriving in London I
    received a polite invitation by letter from Mr. Buxton to take
    breakfast with him. Presenting myself at the appointed time,
    when my name was announced, instead of coming forward promptly
    to take me by the hand, he scrutinized me from head to foot, and
    then inquired, somewhat dubiously, "Have I the pleasure of
    addressing Mr. Garrison, of Boston, in the United States?" "Yes,
    sir," I replied, "I am he; and I am here in accordance with your
    invitation." Lifting up his hands he exclaimed, "Why, my dear
    sir, I thought you were a black man. And I have consequently
    invited this company of ladies and gentlemen to be present to
    welcome Mr. Garrison, the black advocate of emancipation from
    the United States of America." (Laughter.) I have often said,
    sir, that that is the only compliment I have ever had paid to me
    that I care to remember or tell of. For Mr. Buxton had somehow
    or other supposed that no white American could plead for those
    in bondage as I had done, and therefore I must be black.
    (Laughter.)

    It is indeed true, sir, that I have had no other rule by which
    to be guided than this. I never cared to know precisely how many
    stripes were inflicted on the slaves. I never deemed it
    necessary to go down into the Southern States, if I could have
    gone, for the purpose of taking the exact dimensions of the
    slave system. I made it from the start, and always, my own case,
    thus: Did I want to be a slave? No. Did God make me to be a
    slave? No. But I am only a man, only one of the human race; and
    if not created to be a slave, then no other human being was made
    for that purpose. My wife and children, dearer to me than my
    heart's blood, were they made for the auction-block? Never! And
    so it was all very easily settled here (pointing to his breast).
    (Great cheering.) I could not help being an uncompromising
    abolitionist.

    Here allow me to pay a brief tribute to the American
    abolitionists. Putting myself entirely out of the question, I
    believe that in no land, at any time, was there ever a more
    devoted, self-sacrificing, and uncompromising band of men and
    women. Nothing can be said to their credit which they do not
    deserve. With apostolic zeal, they counted nothing dear to them
    for the sake of the slave, and him dehumanized. But whatever has
    been achieved through them is all of God, to whom alone is the
    glory due. Thankful are we all that we have been permitted to
    live to see this day, for our country's sake, and for the sake
    of mankind. Of course, we are glad that our reproach is at last
    taken away; for it is very desirable, if possible, to have the
    good opinions of our fellow-men; but if, to secure these, we
    must sell our manhood and sully our souls, then their bad
    opinions of us are to be coveted instead.

    Sir, my special part in this grand struggle was in first
    unfurling the banner of immediate and unconditional
    emancipation, and attempting to make a common rally under it.
    This I did, not in a free State, but in the city of Baltimore,
    in the slave-holding State of Maryland. It was not long before I
    was arrested, tried, condemned by a packed jury, and
    incarcerated in prison for my anti-slavery sentiments. This was
    in 1830. In 1864 I went to Baltimore for the first time since my
    imprisonment. I do not think that I could have gone at an
    earlier period, except at the peril of my life; and then only
    because the American Government was there in force, holding the
    rebel elements in subserviency. I was naturally curious to see
    the old prison again, and, if possible, to get into my old cell;
    but when I went to the spot, behold! the prison had vanished;
    and so I was greatly disappointed, (Laughter.) On going to
    Washington, I mentioned to President Lincoln, the disappointment
    I had met with. With a smiling countenance and a ready wit, he
    replied, "So, Mr. Garrison, the difference between 1830 and 1864
    appears to be this: in 1830 you could not get out, and in 1864
    you could not get in!" (Great laughter.) This was not only
    wittily said, but it truthfully indicated the wonderful
    revolution that had taken place in Maryland; for she had adopted
    the very doctrine for which she imprisoned me, and given
    immediate and unconditional emancipation to her eighty thousand
    slaves. (Cheers.)

    I commenced the publication of the "_Liberator_" in Boston, on
    the 1st of January, 1831. At that time I was very little known,
    without allies, without means, without subscribers; yet no
    sooner did that little sheet make its appearance, than the South
    was thrown into convulsions, as if it had suddenly been invaded
    by an army with banners! Notwithstanding, the whole country was
    on the side of the slave power--the Church, the State, all
    parties, all denominations, ready to do its bidding! O the
    potency of truth, and the inherent weakness and conscious
    insecurity of great wrong! Immediately a reward of five thousand
    dollars was offered for my apprehension, by the State of
    Georgia. When General Sherman was making his victorious march
    through that State, it occurred to me, but too late, that I
    ought to have accompanied him, and in person claimed the
    reward--(laughter)--but I remembered, that, had I done so, I
    should have had to take my pay in Confederate currency, and
    therefore it would not have paid traveling expenses. (Renewed
    laughter.) Where is Southern Slavery now? (Cheers.) Henceforth,
    through all coming time, advocates of justice and friends of
    reform, be not discouraged; for you will, and you must succeed,
    if you have a righteous cause. No matter at the outset how few
    may be disposed to rally round the standard you have raised--if
    you battle unflinchingly and without compromise--if yours be a
    faith that cannot be shaken, because it is linked to the Eternal
    Throne--it is only a question of time when victory shall come to
    reward your toils. Seemingly, no system of iniquity was ever
    more strongly intrenched, or more sure and absolute in its sway,
    than that of American Slavery; yet it has perished.

      "In the earthquake God has spoken;
        He has smitten with His thunder
        The iron walls asunder,
      And the gates of brass are broken."


    So it has been, so it is, so it ever will be throughout the
    earth, in every conflict for the right. (Great cheering.)  *  *
    *  *  *

    Ladies and gentlemen, I began my advocacy of the Anti-slavery
    cause at the North in the midst of brickbats and rotten eggs. I
    ended it on the soil of South Carolina, almost literally buried
    beneath the wreaths and flowers which were heaped upon me by her
    liberal bondmen. (Cheers.)




LEWIS TAPPAN



    Was one of the warmest friends of the slave and of the colored
    man. He was very solicitous for their welfare, and that the
    colored people who were free should be enlightened and educated.
    He opened a Sunday-school for colored adults, which was
    numerously attended, in West Broadway, New York, and with a few
    others, devoted the most of the Sabbath to their teaching. When
    he and his brother Arthur, assembled the seventy anti-slavery
    agents, who were thereafter, like "firebrands," scattered all
    over the land, they held their meetings in this room. These
    agents were entertained by abolitionists in the city, and many
    of us had two or three of them in each of our families for a
    couple of weeks. They went out all over the land, and were
    instrumental in diffusing more truth, perhaps, about the
    dreadful system of American Slavery, than was accomplished in
    any other way. He also aided in establishing several
    periodicals, brimful of anti-slavery truth; among which, were
    the "_Anti-Slavery Record_," the "_Emancipator_," the "_Slave's
    Friend;_" the latter, to indoctrinate the children in
    Anti-slavery. The American Missionary Society, originally begun
    for the support of a mission in Africa, on the occasion of the
    return of the Amistad captors to their native land, and now
    doing so much for the freedmen of the South, was almost entirely
    established by his efforts. During the continuance of Slavery,
    much was done by this Society for the diffusion of an
    anti-slavery gospel.

    The "Vigilance Committee," for aiding and befriending fugitives,
    of which I was treasurer for many years, had no better or warmer
    friend than he. He was almost always at their meetings, which
    were known only to "the elect," for we dared not hold them too
    publicly, as we almost always had some of the travelers toward
    the "north star" present, whose masters or their agents were
    frequently in the city, in hot pursuit. At first, we sent them
    to Canada, but after a while, sent them only to Syracuse, and
    the centre of the State.

    In 1834, I think, was the first rioting, the sacking of Mr.
    Tappan's house, in Rose Street. The mob brought all his
    furniture out, and piling it up in the street, set it on fire.
    The family were absent at the time. Soon after, they stoned Rev.
    Mr. Ludlow's, and Dr. Cox's church, and the house of the latter.
    They threatened Arthur Tappan & Co's, store, in Pearl Street,
    but hearing that there were a few loaded muskets there, they
    _took it out in threats_. But their mercantile establishment was
    almost ostracised at this time, by the dry goods merchants; and
    country merchants in all parts of the country, north as well as
    south, did not dare to have it known that they bought goods of
    them; and when they did so, requested particularly, that the
    bundles or boxes, should not be marked "from A. Tappan & Co.,"
    as was customary. Southern merchants especially, avoided them,
    and when, two or three years later, there was a general
    insolvency among them, occasionally large losses to New York
    merchants, and in some cases failure; _the Tappans were saved by
    having no Southern debts_!

    Through Mr. Tappan's influence and extensive correspondence
    abroad, many remittances came for the help of the "Vigilance
    Committee," from England and Scotland, and at one time, an
    extensive invoice of useful and fancy articles, in several large
    boxes, was received from the Glasgow ladies, sufficient to
    furnish a large bazaar or fair, which was held in Brooklyn, for
    the benefit of the Committee.

    Although lately afflicted by disease, Mr. Tappan still lives in
    the enjoyment of all his faculties, and a good measure of
    health, and in his advanced years, sees now some of the great
    results of his life-long efforts for the restoration and
    maintenance of human rights.

    Although still suffering under many of the evils which Slavery
    has inflicted upon him, the _American slave_ no longer exists!
    Instead stands up in all our Southern States the _freedman_,
    knowing his rights, and, as a rule, enjoying them. Original
    American abolitionists, who met the scorn and odium, the imputed
    shame and obloquy, the frowns and cold-shoulders which they bore
    through all the dark days of Slavery, now see and feel their
    reward in some measure; to be completed only, when they shall
    hear the plaudit: "Inasmuch as ye have done it to the least of
    these my brethren, ye have done it unto me."

    ANTHONY LANE.

    New York, Nov. 8, 1871.


Mr. Lane, Mr. Tappan's personal friend who labored with him in the
Anti-Slavery Cause, and especially in the Vigilance Committee for many
years, from serious affection of his eyes was not prepared to furnish as
full a sketch of his (Mr. T.'s) labors as was desirable. Mr. Tappan was,
therefore, requested to furnish a few reminiscences from his own
store-house, which he kindly did as follows:


    WILLIAM STILL, ESQ., My dear Sir:--In answer to your request,
    that I would furnish, an article for your forthcoming book,
    giving incidents within my personal knowledge, relating to the
    Underground Rail Road; I have already apprized you of my illness
    and my consequent inability to write such an article as would be
    worthy of your publication. However, feeling somewhat relieved
    to-day, from my paralysis, owing to the cheering sunshine and
    the favor of my Almighty Preserver, I will try to do what I can,
    in dictating a few anecdotes to my amanuensis, which may afford
    you and your readers some gratification.

    These facts I must give without reference to date, as I will not
    tax my memory with perhaps a vain attempt to narrate them in
    order.

    As mentioned in my "Life of Arthur Tappan," some abolitionists
    (myself among the number), doubted the propriety of engaging in
    such measures as were contemplated by the conductors of the
    "Underground Rail Road," fearing that they would not be
    justified in aiding slaves to escape from their masters; but
    reflection convinced them that it was not only right to assist
    men in efforts to obtain their liberty, when unjustly held in
    bondage, but a DUTY.

    Abolitionists, white and colored, both in slave and free States,
    entered into extensive correspondence, set their wits at work to
    devise various expedients for the relief from bondage and
    transmission to the free States and to Canada, of many of the
    most enterprising bondmen and bondwomen. They vied with each
    other in devising means for the accomplishment of this object.
    Those who had money contributed it freely, and those who were
    destitute of money, gave their time, saying with the Apostle:
    "Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have, give I thee."

    1. I recollect that one morning on reaching my office (that of
    the treasurer of the American Missionary Association), my
    assistant told me that in the inner room were eighteen
    fugitives, men, women and children, who had arrived that morning
    from the South in one company. On going into the room, I saw
    them lying about on the bales and boxes of clothing destined for
    our various missionary stations, fatigued, as they doubtless
    were, after their sleepless and protracted struggle for freedom.

    On inquiry, I learned that they had come from a southern city.
    After most extraordinary efforts, it seemed that they had while
    in Slavery, secretly banded together, and put themselves under
    the guidance of an intrepid conductor, whom they had hired to
    conduct them without the limits of the city, in the evening,
    when the police force was changed. They came through
    Pennsylvania and New Jersey to my office. The agent of the
    Underground Rail Road in New York, took charge of them, and
    forwarded them to Albany, and by different agencies to Canada.

    2. I well remember that one morning as I entered the
    Sabbath-school,[A] one of the scholars, a Mrs. Mercy Smith,
    beckoned to me to come to her class, and there introduced to me
    a young girl of about fifteen, as a fugitive, who had arrived
    the day before. In answer to my inquiries, this girl told me the
    name of the southern city, and the names of the persons who had
    held her as a slave, and the mode of her escape, etc. "I was
    walking near the water," she said, "when a white sailor spoke to
    me, and after a few questions, offered to hide me on board his
    vessel and conduct me safely to New York, if I would come to him
    in the evening. I did so, and was hid and fed by him, and on
    landing at New York, he conducted me to Mrs. Smith's house,
    where I am now staying."

    [Footnote A: For three years I superintended a Sabbath-school
    mostly composed of colored children and adults. Most of the
    teachers were warm-hearted abolitionists, and the whole number
    taught in this school during this period, was seven or eight
    hundred.]

    To my inquiry, have you parents living, and also brothers and
    sisters, she replied: "There is no child but myself." "Were not
    your parents kind to you, and did you not love them?" "Yes I
    love them very much."

    "How were you treated by your master and mistress?" "They
    treated me very well." "How then," said I, "could you put
    yourself in the care of that sailor, who was a stranger to you,
    and leave your parents?" I shall never forget her heart-felt
    reply: "_He told me I should be free_!"

    One Sunday morning, I received a letter, informing me that an
    officer belonging to Savannah, Ga., had started for New York, in
    pursuit of two young men, of nineteen or twenty, who had been
    slaves of one of the principal physicians of the place, and who
    had escaped and were supposed to be in New York. The letter
    requested me to find them and give them warning. As there was no
    time to be lost, I concluded to go over to New York,
    notwithstanding the doubtfulness of attempting to find them in
    so large a city. I wrote notices to be read in the colored
    churches and colored Sabbath-schools, which I delivered in
    person. I then went to the colored school, superintended by Rev.
    C.B. Bay. I stated my errand to him, with a description of the
    young men. "Why," said he, "I must have one of them in my
    school." He took me to a class where I found one of the young
    men, to whom I gave the needful information.

    He told me that his father was Dr. ---- of Savannah, and that he
    had five children by the young man's mother, who was his slave.
    On his marriage to a white woman, he sent his five colored
    children and their mother to auction, to be sold for cash to the
    highest bidder. On being put upon the auction-block, this young
    man addressed the bystanders, and told them the circumstances of
    the case; that his mother had long lived in the family of the
    doctor, that it was cruel to sell her and her children, and he
    warned the people not to bid for him, for he would no longer be
    a slave to any man, and if any one bought him, he would lose his
    money. He added, "I thought it right to say this." I then spoke
    to the crowd. "My father," said I, "has long been one of your
    first doctors, and do you think it right for him to sell my
    mother and his children in this way?"

    "I was sold, and my brother also, and the rest, although my
    brother said to the crowd what I had said. We soon made our
    escape, and are now both in the city. I am a blacksmith, and
    have worked six months in one shop, in New York, with white
    journeymen, not one of whom believes, I suppose, that I am a
    colored man."

    It was not surprising, for so fair was his complexion, that with
    the aid of a brown wig, after he had cut off his hair, he was
    completely disguised. He soon notified his brother, who lived in
    another part of the city, and both put themselves out of harm's
    way. They were remarkably fine young men, and it seemed a
    special Providence that I should find them in such a large city,
    and direct them to escape from their pursuer, within one hour
    after I left my house in Brooklyn. I felt it to be an answer to
    prayer.

    4. One day, when I lived in New York City, a colored man came
    running to my house, and in a hurried manner, said: "Is this Mr.
    Tappan?" On replying in the affirmative, he said: "I have driven
    my master from Baltimore. He has just arrived, and the servants
    are taking off the baggage at the Astor House. I inquired of a
    person passing by, where you lived. He said, 80, White Street,
    and I have run here, to tell you that you may give notice to a
    man who has escaped from my master, to this city, that the
    object of this journey is to find him and take him back to
    Slavery."

    The man hurried back, so that he need not be missed by his
    master, who believed that this coachman, who had lived years
    with him, was his confidential servant, and would be true to his
    interest.

    I went immediately to the house of a colored friend, to describe
    the fugitive and see if we could not concert measures to protect
    him. "I think," said he, "that I know the man, by your
    description, and that he boards in this house. He will soon come
    in from South Street, where he has worked to-day." While we were
    consulting together, sure enough, the man came in, and was most
    glad to have the opportunity thus afforded, of secreting
    himself.

    I have not strength to dictate much more, although many other
    instances occur to me of most remarkable providential
    occurrences, of the escape of fugitives within my knowledge. I
    used to say that I was the owner of _half-a-horse_ that was in
    active service, near the Susquehanna River. This horse I owned
    jointly with another friend of the slave, dedicating the animal
    to the service of the Underground Rail Road.

    It was customary for the agent at Havre de Grace, bringing a
    fugitive to the river, to kindle a fire (as it was generally in
    the night), to give notice to a person living on the opposite
    side of the river. This person well understood the signal, and
    would come across in his boat and receive the fugitive.

    An aged colored couple, residing in Brooklyn, came over to my
    office, in New York City, and said that they had just heard from
    Wilmington, N.C., that their two sons (about twenty-five or
    twenty-six years of age), who were slaves, were about to be
    sold, for one thousand dollars each; and they hoped I should be
    able and willing to assist them in raising the money.

    I told them that I had scruples about putting money into the
    hands of slave-holders, but I would give them something that
    might be of as much value. I then pointed out a way by which
    their sons might reach the city.

    In about three weeks, one of the young men came to my office.
    Give me, said I, some particulars of your escape. "I am," said
    he, "a builder, and planned and erected the hotel at Wilmington,
    and some other houses. I used to hire my time of my master, and
    was accustomed to ride about the country attending to my
    business. I borrowed a pass from a man about my size and
    complexion. I then went to the rail road office, and asked for a
    ticket for Fredericksburg. From there I came on directly to
    Washington. I had not been questioned before; but here, I was
    taken up and carried before a magistrate. He examined me by the
    description in my pass; complexion, height, etc., then read
    '_and a scar under his left knee_.' When I heard that, my heart
    sank within me; for I had no scar there that I knew. 'Pull up
    the boy's trowsers,' said the justice to the constable. He did
    so. and said 'here's a scar!' 'All right,' said the justice, 'no
    mistake, let him go.' Glad was I. I got a ticket for Baltimore,
    and there for another town, and finally reached here."

    You asked me to give an account of the sums that I have expended
    for the Underground Rail Road, etc. I must be excused from doing
    this, as if I could now ascertain, I should not think it worth
    while to mention. I must now conclude my narrative, by giving,
    with some additions, an account of an interesting escape from
    Slavery, which was written by my wife, more than fifteen years
    ago, for Frederic Douglass' paper.

    [On page 177 the narrative of "The Fleeing Girl of Fifteen" is
    so fully written out, that it precludes the necessity of
    reproducing a large portion of this story.]

    In the evening a friend arrived, bringing with him a bright,
    handsome _boy_, whom he called Joe. Most heartily was "Joe"
    welcomed, and deep was the thrill which we felt, as we looked
    upon him and thought of the perils he had escaped. The next day
    was Thanksgiving-day, and my house was thronged with guests. In
    an upper room, with a comfortable fire, and the door locked, sat
    "Joe," still in boy's clothes, to be able to escape at the first
    intimation of danger, but with a smile and look of touching
    gratitude, whenever any one of the family who was in the secret,
    left the festive group to look in upon the interesting stranger.
    Not one of us can ever forget the deep abhorrence of Slavery,
    and thanksgiving to Almighty God, that we felt that day as we
    moved among the guests, who were wholly ignorant of the occupant
    of that upper room. Some curiosity was indeed excited among the
    little grandchildren, who saw slices of turkey and plum pudding
    sent up stairs. It was "Joe's" first Thanksgiving dinner in a
    free State.

    As she brought nothing away with her, it was necessary, the next
    day, to procure a complete wardrobe for a girl, which was
    carefully packed for her to take with her.

    The second day after "Joe's" arrival, the Rev. Mr. Freeman,
    pastor of a colored church in Brooklyn, agreed to accompany her
    to her uncle Brown's in Canada West, and we saw them depart,
    knowing the danger that would beset both on the way. The
    following is part of a letter from Mr. F., giving an account of
    their journey. After stating that they left New York, in the
    cars at five o'clock, P.M., and through the providence of God,
    went on their way safely and speedily, with none to molest or to
    make them afraid, he says:


        "On reaching Rochester, I began to ask myself 'how shall
        we get over Niagara Falls?' I was not sure that the cars
        ran across the Suspension Bridge; besides, I felt that
        we were in more danger here, than we had been at any
        other place. Knowing that there was a large reward
        offered for Joe's apprehension, I feared there might be
        some lurking spy ready to pounce upon us. But when we
        arrived at the Bridge, the conductor said: 'Sit still;
        this car goes across.' You may judge of my joy and
        relief of mind, when I looked out and was sure that we
        were over! Thank God, I exclaimed, we are safe in
        Canada!

        Having now a few minutes before the cars would start
        again, I sat down and hastily wrote a few lines, to
        inform friends at home of our safe arrival. As soon as
        possible, I ran to the post-office with my letter, paid
        the postage, and while I was waiting for my change, the
        car bell rang. I quickly returned, and in a few minutes,
        we were on our way to Chatham (200 miles West). That
        place we reached between seven and eight o'clock,
        Saturday evening. When we got out, we met a gentleman
        who asked me if I wanted a boarding-house. I said yes;
        and he invited me to go with him. I asked him if there
        was any way for us to get to Dresden that night. He
        answered, 'No, it is a dark night, and a muddy road, and
        no conveyance can be got tonight.' I soon found that we
        must stay in Chatham until Monday morning.

        On our way to the boarding-house, the gentleman said to
        me: 'Is this your son with you?' I answered, no; and
        then I asked him, if he knew a man living in D., by the
        name of Bradley. He replied that he was very well
        acquainted with him, and then inquired if that young man
        was Mr. Bradley's brother. I said, no--not exactly a
        brother. He must have thought it strange that I did not
        give him a more definite answer to his question.

        When we reached the house, we found several boarders in
        the sitting-room and a few neighbors. I had already told
        him my name, but with regard to Joe, I had not yet had a
        chance to explain. I, of course, was introduced to those
        who were in the room, but Joe--well, Joe took a seat,
        and did not seem to be troubled about an introduction.
        As the landlord was going out of the room, I asked
        permission to speak with him alone. He took me into
        another room, and I said to him: 'That young man, as you
        call him, is a young woman, and has come dressed in this
        manner, all the way from Washington City. She would be
        very glad now to be able to change her clothes.'

        He was greatly surprised, and would hardly believe that
        it was so; but said, 'I will call my wife.' She came,
        and I guess all the women in the house came with her.
        They soon disappeared, and Joe with them, who, after
        being absent a while, returned, and was introduced as
        Miss Ann Maria Weems. The whole company were on their
        feet, shook hands, laughed, and rejoiced, declaring that
        this beat all they had ever seen before. Chatham
        contains, I was told, more than three thousand
        fugitives. The weather there, is not colder than in New
        York.

        The next morning was the Sabbath, but this I must pass
        and hasten to D., the residence of Mr. Bradley. We
        started early Monday morning. As a part of the road was
        very bad, we did not reach there till a late hour. As we
        were passing along, and getting near to the place, we
        met two colored men who were talking together--one on
        horseback, and the other on foot. I inquired of them, if
        they could tell me how far it was to Mr. Bradley's. The
        man on horseback said it was about a mile further, and
        then proceeded to give directions. After he had done
        this, he said: 'I reckon I am the one that you want to
        find, my name is Bradley.' Well, I replied, probably you
        are the man. Just then Ann Maria turned her head around.
        As soon as he saw her face, he exclaimed: 'My Lord!
        Maria, is that you? Is that you? My child, is it you? We
        never expected to see you again! We had given you up; O,
        what will your aunt say? It will kill her! She will die!
        It will kill her.'

        I told him, that as I was obliged to leave again soon, I
        must proceed. 'Well,' said he, 'you go on; I am just
        going over to M., and will be back in a few minutes.' We
        started for his house, and he towards M., but we had
        only gone a short distance, when he overtook us,
        exclaiming: 'I can't go to M.,' and began talking to Ann
        Maria, asking her all about her friends and relatives,
        whom they had left behind, and about his old master, and
        his wife's master, from whom they had run away four
        years before. As we approached the house, he said: 'I
        will go and open the gate, and have a good fire to warm
        you.' When he came up to the gate, he met his wife, who
        was returning from a store or neighbor's house, and he
        said to her, 'That's Ann Maria coming yonder.' She
        stopped until we came to the gate; the tears were
        rolling from her eyes, and she exclaimed: 'Ann Maria, is
        it you?' The girl leaped from the wagon, and they fell
        on each other's necks, weeping and rejoicing. Such a
        scene I never before witnessed. She, who had been given
        up as lost, was now found! She, who but a short time
        before, had been, as they supposed, a slave for life,
        was now free.

        We soon entered the house, and after the first gush of
        feeling had somewhat subsided, they both began a general
        inquiry about the friends they had left behind. Every
        now and then, the aunt would break out: 'My child, you
        are here! Thank God, you are free! We were talking about
        you today, and saying, we shall never see you again; and
        now here you are with us.' I remained about an hour and
        a half with them, took dinner, and then started for
        home, rejoicing that I had been to a land where colored
        men are free.

        This Mr. Bradley, who ran away with himself and wife
        about four years ago from the land of whips and chains,
        is the owner of two farms, and is said to be worth three
        thousand dollars. Can slaves take care of themselves?"


    You may well suppose that the receipt of this letter gave us
    great pleasure, and called forth heartfelt thanksgiving to Him,
    who had watched over this undertaking, and protected all
    concerned in it. A bright and promising girl had been rescued
    from the untold miseries of a slave woman's life, and found a
    good home, where she would have an opportunity to acquire an
    education and be trained for a useful and happy life. Mr.
    Bradley intended to send for her parents, and hoped to prevail
    on them to come and live with him.

    Truly yours,

ELIJAH F. PENNYPACKER,


Whose name belongs to the history of the Underground Rail Road, owed his
peculiarly fine nature to a mother of large physical proportions, and
correspondingly liberal mental and spiritual endowments. She was a
natural sovereign in the sphere in which she moved, and impressed her
son with the qualities which made his Anti-slavery life nothing but an
expression of the rules of conduct which governed him in all other
particulars. Believing in his inmost soul in principles of rectitude,
all men believed in him, his "yea," or "nay," passing current wherever
he went. Tall, dignified, and commanding, he had that in his face which
inspired immediate confidence. Said one who looked: "If that is not a
good man, there is no use in the Lord writing His signature on human
countenances." Even in early youth, honors which he never sought, were
pressed upon him, as he gave assurance of ability commensurate with his
worth. He was sent to the Legislature of Pennsylvania for five sessions,
where he became the personal friend of the Governor, Joseph Ritner, and
also of Thaddeus Stevens. At the request of the latter, he consented to
occupy the position of Secretary to the Board of Canal Commissioners,
and two years after, by the wishes of Mr. Ritner, took a seat in the
Canal Board, becoming a co-worker with Thaddeus Stevens. Here ripened a
friendship, which afterward became of national importance, for although
a nature so positive as that of Thaddeus Stevens could scarcely be said
to be under the influence of any other mind, still, if there were those
who exercised a moral sway, sustaining this courageous republican
leader, at a higher level than he might otherwise have attained, Elijah
F. Pennypacker was surely amongst them. Almost antipodal as they were in
certain respects, each recognized the genuine ring of the other, and
admired and respected that which was most true and noble. The purity,
simplicity and high-minded honor which distinguished the younger, had
its effect on the elder, even while he smiled at the inflexibility which
would not swerve one hair's breadth from the line of right. The story is
often told, how, when this young man's conscience stood bolt upright in
the way of what was deemed a desirable arrangement, Stevens one day
exclaimed: "It don't do, Pennypacker, to be so d----d honest."
Pennypacker stood his ground, and the life-long respect which Stevens
ever after awarded, proved that _he_ at least, thought it _did_ do.

When it became clear to his mind, that a great battle was to be fought
between Liberty and Slavery in America, Mr. Pennypacker felt it to be
his duty to turn aside from the sunny paths of political preferment,
into the shadows of obscure life, and ally himself with the
misrepresented, despised and outcast Abolitionists, ever after devoting
himself assiduously to the promotion of the cause of Freedom.
Notwithstanding his natural modesty, here as elsewhere, he took a
conspicuous position. At home, in the local Anti-slavery Society of his
neighborhood, he was for many years chosen president, as he was also of
the Chester county Anti-slavery Society, and of the Pennsylvania State
Anti-slavery Society.

Soon after his retirement from public life, he united himself with the
Society of Friends, but was much too radical to be an acceptable
addition. For a long time he was endured rather than endorsed, and it
was only when such anti-slavery feelings as he cherished became
generally diffused throughout the Society, that he found the unity he
desired and expected. Whatever may have been his trials here or
elsewhere, he found a rich reward for his faithfulness in the
intellectual and moral growth which he attained by association with the
most advanced minds of the time, and he has often been heard to say that
no part of his life has been more fully and generously compensated than
that devoted to the Anti-slavery cause.

His home, near Phoenixville, Chester county, Pa., was an important
station on the Underground Rail Road, the majority of fugitives
proceeding through the southern rural districts of Eastern Pennsylvania,
passing through his hands. At all times he was deeply interested in
their welfare, and in his hospitality towards them, had the entire
sympathy and co-operation of his family, they, like himself, being
earnest abolitionists, but his more important duty of influencing public
sentiment in favor of freedom, overshadowed his labors in this
department. In steadfastness and integrity he stood beside Findley
Coates and Thomas Whitson, a trio who will long be remembered in their
native State.

So long as Dr. B. Fussell resided in the northern section of Chester
county, he and Elijah F. Pennypacker, were companions in Anti-slavery
and other reform labors, as well as in business on the Underground Rail
Road. Differing widely in temperament and mental structure, these two
men were harmonious in spirit, and a close bond of sympathy and
affection existed between them. It was a mutual pleasure to work as
brothers, and afterward to rejoice together in labor accomplished. One
of the last visits which roused the flickering animation of the dying
physician, was from this friend of more vigorous years, and the voice
which gave fitting expression to the worth of the departed, at his
funeral, was that of Elijah F. Pennypacker.

Like that of the highest grade of men everywhere, his appreciation of
woman has ever been keen and true, and demanding the full rights of
humanity, he makes no distinction, either on account of sex or color. In
his own family, he has always encouraged the pursuit of any occupation
congenial to the person choosing it; whether or not, it were a departure
from the routine of custom, and in educational advantages he has ever
demanded the widest possible culture for all. Wherever known, he is
estimated as a pillar in the temperance cause. Gentle, modest, courteous
and benignant, he combines, in a remarkable degree, strength and
tenderness, courage and sympathy. At one time, holding at bay the powers
of evil and baffling the most determined opponents by his manly
adherence to right; at another he may be found yielding to impressions
bidding him to seek the source of some hidden private sorrow, and with
delicate touch, binding up a flowing wound, or offering himself as the
defender and protector of such as may need his brotherly care. Obedient
to these impressions, he rarely errs in his ministrations, and whether
his errand be to remonstrate with the evil doer, setting his sins
clearly and vividly before him, or to strengthen and encourage suffering
innocence, he is alike successful. Men, whom he has warned in reproof
when it cost the utmost bravery to do so, have become his confiding
friends, and have been known afterward to entrust him with heavy
pecuniary responsibilities, and to point him out to their children as an
example worthy of imitation. Those whose griefs he has frequently
softened, have laid upon his head a crown of blessing whiter than the
honors which come with his silver hairs, and all with whom he comes in
contact in business, in duty, or in social intercourse, acknowledge the
presence, the wide usefulness and influence of the upright man.

The memories of the choice spirits he used to meet in the Anti-slavery
gatherings; their mutual and kindly greetings; the holy resolves which
animated them and made the time hours of exaltation, now serve to
brighten the pathway of his declining years, and to throw a halo around
the restfulness of his home, as in peace of mind he looks abroad over
his beloved country, to see millions of enfranchised men beginning to
avail themselves of its pecuniary, educational and political advantages,
and beholds them starting on a career of material and spiritual
prosperity, with a rapidity commensurate with the expansive force of the
repressed energies of a race.

MEMORIAL.


William Wright, a distinguished abolitionist of Adams county,
Pennsylvania, was born on the 21st of December, 1788. Various
circumstances conspired to make this unassuming Quaker an earnest
Abolitionist and champion of the oppressed in every land and of every
nationality and color. His uncle, Benjamin Wright, and cousin, Samuel B.
Wright, were active members of the old Pennsylvania Abolition Society,
and at the time of the emancipation of the slaves in this state were
often engaged in lawsuits with slave-holders to compel them to release
their bondmen, according to the requirements of the law. William Wright
grew up under the influence of the teachings of these relatives. Joined
to this, his location caused him to take an extraordinary interest in
Underground Rail Road affairs. He lived near the foot of the southern
slope of the South Mountain, a spur of the Alleghenies which extends,
under various names, to Chattanooga, Tennessee. This mountain was
followed in its course by hundreds of fugitives until they got into
Pennsylvania, and were directed to William Wright's house.

In November, 1817, William Wright married Phebe Wierman, (born on the
8th of February, 1790,) daughter of a neighboring farmer, and sister of
Hannah W. Gibbons, wife of Daniel Gibbons, a notice of whom appears
elsewhere in this work. Phebe Wright was the assistant of her husband in
every good work, and their married life of forty-eight years was a long
period of united and efficient labor in the cause of humanity. She still
(1871) survives him. William and Phebe Wright began their Underground
Rail Road labors about the year 1819. Hamilton Moore, who ran away from
Baltimore county, Maryland, was the first slave aided by them. His
master came for him, but William Wright and Joel Wierman, Phebe Wright's
brother, who lived in the neighborhood, rescued him and sent him to
Canada.

In the autumn of 1828, as Phebe Wright, surrounded by her little
children, came out upon her back porch in the performance of some
household duty, she saw standing before her in the shade of the early
November morning, a colored man without hat, shoes, or coat. He asked if
Mr. Wright lived there, and upon receiving an affirmative reply, said
that he wanted work. The good woman, comprehending the situation at a
glance, told him to come into the house, get warm, and wait till her
husband came home. He was shivering with cold and fright. When William
Wright came home the fugitive told his story. He came from Hagerstown,
Maryland, having been taught the blacksmith's trade there. In this
business it was his duty to keep an account of all the work done by him,
which record he showed to his master at the end of the week. Knowing no
written character but the figure 5 he kept this account by means of a
curious system of hieroglyphics in which straight marks meant horse
shoes put on, circles, cart-wheels fixed, etc. One day in happening to
see his master's book he noticed that wherever five and one were added
the figure 6 was used. Having practiced this till he could make it he
ever after used it in his accounts. As his master was looking over these
one day, he noticed the new figure and compelled the slave to tell how
he had learned it. He flew into a rage, and said, "I'll teach you how to
be learning new figures," and picking up a horse-shoe threw it at him,
but fortunately for the audacious chattel, missed his aim.
Notwithstanding his ardent desire for liberty, the slave considered it
his duty to remain in bondage until he was twenty-one years old in order
to repay by his labor the trouble and expense which his master had had
in rearing him. On the evening of his twenty-first anniversary he turned
his face toward the North star, and started for a land of freedom.
Arriving at Reisterstown, a village on the Westminster turnpike about
twenty-five miles from Baltimore and thirty-five miles from Mr. Wright's
house, he was arrested and placed in the bar-room of the country tavern
in care of the landlady to wait until his captors, having finished some
work in which they were engaged, could take him back to his master. The
landlady, being engaged in getting supper, set him to watch the cakes
that were baking. As she was passing back and forth he ostentatiously
removed his hat, coat, and shoes, and placed them in the bar-room.
Having done this, he said to her, "I will step out a moment." This he
did, she sending a boy to watch him. When the boy came out he appeared
to be very sick and called hastily for water. The boy ran in to get it.
Now was his golden opportunity. Jumping the fence he ran to a clump of
trees which occupied low ground behind the house and concealing himself
in it for a moment, ran and continued to run, he knew not whither, until
he found himself at the toll gate near Petersburg, in Adams county.
Before this he had kept in the fields and forests, but now found himself
compelled to come out upon the road. The toll-gate keeper, seeing at
once that he was a fugitive, said to him, "I guess you don't know the
road." "I guess I can find it myself," was the reply. "Let me show you,"
said the man. "You may if you please," replied the fugitive. Taking him
out behind his dwelling, he pointed across the fields to a new brick
farm-house, and said, "Go there and inquire for Mr. Wright." The slave
thanked him and did as he was directed.

He remained with William Wright until April, 1829. During this short
time he learned to read, write, and cipher as far as the single rule of
three, as it was then called, or simple proportion. During his residence
with William Wright, nothing could exceed his kindness or gratitude to
the whole family. He learned to graft trees, and thus rendered great
assistance to William Wright in his necessary business. When working in
the kitchen during the winter he would never allow Phebe Wright to
perform any hard labor, always scrubbing the floor and lifting heavy
burdens for her. Before he went away in the spring he assumed a name
which his talents, perseverance, and genius have rendered famous in both
hemispheres, that of James W.C. Pennington. The initial W. was for his
benefactor's family, and C. for the family of his former master. From
William Wright's he went to Daniel Gibbons', thence to Delaware county,
Pennsylvania, and from there to New Haven, Conn., where, while
performing the duties of janitor at Yale College, he completed the
studies of the college course. After a few years, he went to Heidelberg,
where the degree of D.D. was conferred upon him. He never forgot William
Wright and his family, and on his return from Europe brought them each a
present. The story of his escape and wonderful abilities was spread over
England. An American acquaintance of the Wright family was astonished,
on visiting an Anti-slavery fair in London many years ago, to see among
the pictures for sale there, one entitled, "William and Phebe Wright
receiving James W.C. Pennington." The Dr. died in Florida, in 1870,
where he had gone to preach and assist in opening schools amongst the
Freemen.

In 1842 a party of sixteen slaves came to York, Pa., from Baltimore
county, Md. Here they were taken in charge by William Wright, Joel
Fisher, Dr. Lewis, and William Yocum. The last named was a constable,
and used to assist the Underground Rail Road managers by pretending to
hunt fugitives with the kidnappers. Knowing where the fugitives were he
was enabled to hunt them in the opposite direction from that in which
they had gone, and thus give them time to escape. This constable and a
colored man of York took this party one by one out into Samuel Willis'
corn-field, near York, and hid them under the shocks. The following
night Dr. Lewis piloted them to near his house, at Lewisburg, York
county, on the banks of the Conewago. Here they were concealed several
days, Dr. Lewis carrying provisions to them in his saddle-bags. When the
search for them had been given up in William Wright's neighborhood, he
went down to Lewisburg and in company with Dr. Lewis took the whole
sixteen across the Conewago, they fording the river and carrying the
fugitives across on their horses. It was a gloomy night in November.
Every few moments clouds floated across the moon, alternately lighting
up and shading the river, which, swelled by autumn rains, ran a flood.
William Wright and Dr. Lewis mounted men or women behind and took
children in their arms. When the last one got over, the doctor, who
professed to be an atheist, exclaimed, "Great God! is this a Christian
land, and are Christians thus forced to flee for their liberty?" William
Wright guided this party to his house that night and concealed them in a
neighboring forest until it was safe for them to proceed on their way to
Canada.

Just in the beginning of harvest of the year 1851, four men came off
from Washington county, Maryland. They were almost naked and seemed to
have come through great difficulties, their clothing being almost
entirely torn off. As soon as they came, William Wright went to the
store and got four pair of shoes. It was soon heard that their masters
and the officers had gone to Harrisburg to hunt them. Two of them,
Fenton and Tom, were concealed at William Wright's, and the other two,
Sam and one whose name has been forgotten, at Joel Wierman's. In a day
or two, as William Wright, a number of carpenters, and other workmen,
among whom were Fenton and Tom, were at work in the barn, a party of men
rode up and recognized the colored men as slaves of one of their number.
The colored men said they had left their coats at the house. William
Wright looked earnestly at them and told them to go to the house and get
their coats. They went off, and one of them was observed by one of the
family to take his coat hastily down from where it hung in one of the
outhouses, a few moments afterward. After conversing a few moments at
the barn, William Wright brought the slave-holders down to the house,
where he, his wife and daughters engaged them in a controversy on the
subject of slavery which lasted about an hour. One of them seemed very
much impressed, and labored hard to convince his host that he was a good
master and would treat his men well. Finally one of the party asked
William Wright to produce the men. He replied that he would not do that,
that they might search his premises if they wished to, but they could
not compel him to bring forth the fugitives. Seeing that they had been
duped, they became very angry and proceeded forthwith to search the
house and all the outhouses immediately around it, without, however,
finding those whom they sought. As they left the house and went toward
the barn, William Wright, waving his hand toward the former, said, "You
see they are not anywhere there." They then went to the barn and gave it
a thorough search. Between it and the house, a little away from the
path, but in plain sight, stood the carriage-house, _which they passed
by without seeming to notice_. After they had gone, poor Tom was found
in this very house, curled up under the seats of the old-fashioned
family carriage. He had never come to the house at all, but had heard
the voices of his hunters from his hiding-place, during their whole
search. About two o'clock in the morning, Fenton was found by William
Wright out in the field. He had run along the bed of a small water
course, dry at that time of year, until he came to a rye field amid
whose high grain he hid himself until he thought the danger was past.
From William Wright's the slave-catchers went to Joel Wierman's, where,
despite all that could be done, they got poor Sam, took him off to
Maryland and sold him to the traders to be taken far south.

In 1856 William Wright was a delegate from Adams county to the
Convention at Philadelphia which nominated John C. Fremont for President
of the United States. As the counties were called in alphabetical order,
he responded first among the Pennsylvania delegation. It is thought that
he helped away during his whole life, nearly one thousand slaves. During
his latter years, he was aided in the good work by his children, who
never hesitated to sacrifice their own pleasure in order to help away
fugitives.

His convictions on the subject of slavery seem to have been born with
him, to have grown with his growth, and strengthened with his strength.
He could not remember when he first became interested in the subject.

William Wright closed his long and useful life on the 25th of October,
1865. More fortunate than his co-laborer, Daniel Gibbons, he lived to
see the triumph of the cause in which he had labored all his life. His
latter years were cheered by the remembrance of his good deeds in the
cause of human freedom. Modest and retiring, he would not desire, as he
does not need, a eulogy. His labors speak for themselves, and are such
as are recorded upon the Lamb's Book of Life.



DR. BARTHOLOMEW FUSSELL.


Dr. Fussell, whose death occurred within the current year, was no
ordinary man. He was born in Chester county, Pa., in 1794, his ancestors
being members of the Society of Friends, principally of English origin,
who arrived in America during the early settlement of Pennsylvania, some
being of the number who, with William Penn, built their homes on the
unbroken soil, where Philadelphia now stands.

He inherited all the bravery of these early pioneers, who left their
homes for the sake of religious freedom, the governing principle of his
life being a direct antagonism to every form of oppression. Removing in
early manhood, to Maryland, where negro Slavery was legally protected,
he became one of the most active opponents of the system, being a friend
and co-laborer of Elisha Tyson, known and beloved as "Father Tyson," by
all the slaves of the region, and to the community at large, as one of
the most philanthropic of men.

While teaching school during the week, as a means of self-education, and
reading medicine at night, the young student expended his surplus energy
in opening a Sabbath-school for colored persons, teaching them the
rudiments of knowledge, not for a few hours only, but for the whole day,
and frequently finding as many as ninety pupils collected to receive the
inestimable boon which gave them the power of reading the Bible for
themselves. To the deeply religious nature of these Africans, this was
the one blessing they prized above all others in his power to bestow,
and the overflowing gratitude they gave in return, was a memory he
cherished to the latest years of his life.

After his graduation in medicine, being at one time called upon to
deliver an address before the Medical Society of Baltimore, in the midst
of a pro-slavery audience, and before slave-holding professors and men
of authority, Dr. Fussell, with a courage scarcely to be comprehended at
this late day, denounced "the most preposterous and cruel practice of
Slavery, as replete with the causes of disease," and expressed the hope
that the day would come "when Slavery and cruelty should have no abiding
place in the whole habitable earth; when the philosopher and the pious
Christian could use the salutation of 'brother,' and the physician and
divine be as one man; when the rich and the poor should know no
distinction; the great and the small be equal in dominion, and the
_arrogant master_ and _his menial slave_ should make a truce of
friendship with each other, all following the same law of reason, all
guided by the same light of Truth!"

As a matter of course, a spirit so thoroughly awake to the welfare of
humanity, would hail with joy and welcome as a brother, the appearance
of such a devoted advocate of freedom, as Benjamin Lundy; and, with all
the warmth of his nature, would give love, admiration, and reverence to
the later apostle of immediate emancipation, William Lloyd Garrison.

It was one of the pleasures of Dr. Fussell's life that he had been
enabled to take the first number of the "_Liberator_," and to continue a
subscriber without intermission, until the battle being ended, the last
number was announced.

He was himself, one of the most earnest workers in the Anti-slavery
cause, never omitting in a fearless manner, to embrace an opportunity to
protest against the encouragement of a pro-slavery spirit.

Returning to Pennsylvania, to practice his profession, his home became
one of the havens where the hunted fugitive from Slavery found food,
shelter and rest. Laboring in connection with the late Thomas Garrett,
of Wilmington, Del., and with many others, at available points, about
two thousand fugitives passed through his hands, on their way to
freedom, and amongst these, he frequently had the delight of welcoming
some of his old Sabbath-school pupils. The mutual recognition was
sometimes touching in the extreme.

In later life, his anecdotes and reminiscences, told in the vivid style,
resulting from a remarkably retentive memory, which could recall word,
tone, and gesture, brought to life, some of the most interesting of his
experiences with these fleeing bondmen, whose histories no romance could
ever equal.

Being one of the signers of the "Declaration of Sentiments," issued by
the American Anti-slavery Society in 1833, he had also the gratification
of attending the last meeting of the Pennsylvania Anti-slavery Society,
called to celebrate the downfall of Slavery in America, and the
dissolution of an organization whose purpose was effected. There are
those, who may remember how at that time, in perfect forgetfulness of
self, the relation of the heroism of his friend, Elisha Tyson, seemed to
recall for a moment, the vigor of youth to render the decrepitude of age
almost majestic.

But it was not Slavery alone, which occupied the thoughts and attention
of this large-hearted man. He was well known as an advocate of common
school education, of temperance, and of every other interest, which, in
his view, pertained to the welfare of man.

Unfortunately, he was addicted to the use of tobacco from his youth.
Having become convinced that it was an evil, he, for the sake of
consistency and as an example to others, resolutely abandoned the habit,
at the age of seventy. He was fond of accrediting his resolve to a very
aged relative, who, in remonstrating with him upon the subject, replied
to his remark, that a sudden cessation from a practice so long indulged
in, might result in his death: "Well, die, then, and go to heaven
decently."

As a practitioner of medicine, he was eminently successful, his intense
sympathy with suffering, seeming to elevate his faculties and give them
unwonted vigor in tracing the hidden causes of disease, and in
suggesting to his mind alleviating agencies. His patients felt an
unspeakable comfort in his presence, well knowing that the best possible
remedy which his knowledge, his judgment or his experience suggested,
would be selected, let the difficulty and inconvenience to himself be
what it would. In cases where life hung trembling in the balance, he
would watch night after night, feeding the flickering flame until he
perceived it brighten, and this in the abode of misery just as freely as
in the home of wealth. The life-long affection of those whom he
recalled, was his reward where often none was sought or expected.

He believed in woman as only a thoroughly good man can, and from early
youth, he had been impressed with her peculiar fitness for the practice
of medicine. The experience of a physician confirmed him in his
sentiments, and it became one of his most earnest aspirations to open to
her all the avenues to the study of medicine. In the year 1840, he gave
regular instruction to a class of ladies, and it was through one of
these pupils, that the first female graduate in America was interested
in the study of medicine. In 1846 he communicated to a few
liberal-minded professional men, a plan for the establishment of a
college of the highest grade for the medical education of women. This
long-cherished plan, hallowed to him by the approbation of a beloved
wife, was well received. Others, with indomitable zeal, took up the
work, and finally, after a succession of disappointments and
discouragements from causes within and without, the Woman's College, on
North College avenue, Philadelphia, starting from the germ of his
thought, entered on the career of prosperity it is so well entitled to
receive. Though never at any time connected with the college, he
regarded its success with the most affectionate interest, considering
its proposition as one of the most important results of his life.

Happy in having lived to see Slavery abolished, and believing in the
speedy elevation of woman to her true dignity as joint sovereign with
man, and in the mitigation of the evils of war, intemperance, poverty,
and crime, which might be expected to follow such a result, he rested
from his labors, and died in peace.



THOMAS SHIPLEY.[A]


Thomas Shipley, one of the foremost in the early generation of
philanthropists who devoted their lives to the extinction of human
slavery, was born in Philadelphia on the second of Fourth month, 1787.
He was the youngest of five children of William and Margaret Shipley,
his father having emigrated from Uttoxeter, in Staffordshire, England,
about the year 1750. From a very early period in the history of the
Society of Friends his ancestors had been members of that body, and he
inherited from them the strong sense of personal independence, and the
love of toleration and respect for the rights of others which have ever
characterized that body of people.

Soon after his birth, his mother died, and he was thus early deprived of
the fostering care of a pious and devoted parent, whose counsels are so
important in forming the youthful mind, and in giving a direction to
future life.

A few years after the death of his mother, his father was removed, and
Thomas was left an orphan before he had attained his sixth year. After
this affecting event he was taken into the family of Isaac Bartram, who
had married his eldest sister. Here he remained for several years,
acquiring the common rudiments of education, and at a suitable age was
sent to Westtown school; after remaining there for a little more than a
year, he met with an accident, which rendered it necessary for him to
return home; and the effects of which prevented him from proceeding with
his education. He fell from the top of a high flight of steps to the
ground, and received an injury of the head, followed by convulsions,
which continued at intervals for a considerable time, and rendered him
incapable of any effort of mind or body.

He was, during childhood, remarkably fond of reading, and was
distinguished among his friends and associates for uncommon perseverance
in accomplishing anything he undertook, a trait which peculiarly marked
him through life; his disposition is said to have been unusually amiable
and docile, so as to endear him very strongly to his relatives and
friends.

After his removal from Westtown, he was again taken into the family of
his brother-in-law, and remained under the care of his sister, who was
very much attached to him, until he was placed as an apprentice to the
hardware business. While here, he was entirely relieved of the
affliction caused by the fall, and was restored to sound health. About
the age of twenty-one, he entered upon the pursuits of the business he
had selected.

The exact time at which his attention was turned to the subject of
slavery cannot be ascertained, but it is probable that a testimony
against it was among his earliest impressions as a member of the
religious Society of Friends. He joined the "Pennsylvania Society for
the Promoting the Abolition of Slavery," etc., in 1817, and the ardent
interest which he took in its objects, was evinced on many occasions
within the recollection of many now living. He was for many years an
active member of its Board of Education, and took a prominent part in
extending the benefits of learning to colored children and youth.

The career of Thomas Shipley, as it was connected with the interests of
the colored community, abounds in incidents which have rarely occurred
in the life of any individual. Being universally regarded as their
adviser and protector, he was constantly solicited for his advice on
questions touching their welfare. This led him to investigate the laws
relating to this class of persons, in all their extended ramifications.
The knowledge he thus acquired, together with his practical acquaintance
with the business and decisions of our courts, rendered his opinion
peculiarly serviceable on all matters affecting their rights. Never did
a merchant study more closely the varied relations of business, and
their influence on his interests, than did Thomas Shipley all those
questions which concerned the well-being of those for whom he was so
warmly interested. He had volunteered his services as their advocate,
and they could not have been more faithfully served had they poured out
the wealth of Croesus at the feet of the most learned counsel.

On every occasion of popular commotion where the safety of the colored
people was threatened, he was found at his post, fearlessly defending
their rights, and exerting his influence with those in authority to
throw around them the protection of the laws. In the tumultuous scenes
which disgraced Philadelphia, in the summer of 1835, in which the fury
of the mob was directed against the persons and property of the colored
inhabitants, he acted with an energy and prudence rarely found combined
in the same individual.

The mob had collected and organized to the number of several hundred,
and were marching through the lower part of the city, dealing
destruction in their course; the houses of respectable and worthy
colored citizens were broken in upon, the furniture scattered to the
winds, all they possessed destroyed or plundered, and they themselves
subjected to the most brutal and savage treatment. Defenceless infancy
and decrepid age were alike disregarded in the general devastation which
these ruffians had decreed should attend their course. The color of the
skin was the mark by which their vengeance was directed, and the cries
and entreaties of their innocent and defenceless victims were alike
disregarded in the accomplishment of their ends. Already had several
victims fallen before the fury of the ruthless band. Law and order were
laid waste, and the officers of justice looked on, some perhaps with
dismay, and others with indifference, while the rights of citizens were
prostrated, and their peaceful and quiet homes invaded by the hand of
violence. At such a time the voice of remonstrance or entreaty, would
have been useless, and had the avowed friends of the colored man
interfered in any public manner, the effect would probably have been to
increase the fury of the storm, and to have directed the violence of the
mob upon themselves.

Under these perilous circumstances, Thomas Shipley was determined to
attempt an effort for their relief. He could not look on and see those
for whom he was so deeply interested threatened almost with
extermination without an effort for their preservation, and yet he was
aware that his presence amongst the mob might subject him to
assassination, without adding to the security of the objects of his
solicitude. He, therefore, determined to disguise himself in such a
manner as not to be recognized, and to mingle amongst the rioters in
order to ascertain their objects, and if possible to convey such
information to the proper authorities as might lead to the arrest of
those most active in fomenting disorder. Accordingly he left his house
late in the evening, attired so as to be completely disguised, and
repaired to the scene of tumult. By this time much mischief had been
done, and to add fresh fury to the multitude, and to incite them to new
deeds of blood, nothing was wanting but some act of resistance on the
part of their victims, who, during the whole period, had conducted
themselves with a forbearance and patience highly creditable to them as
good citizens and upright Christians. Such an occasion was about to
occur, and was prevented by the admirable coolness and forethought of
Thomas Shipley.

A number of colored men who had been driven to desperation by the acts
of the mob, and who had relinquished the idea of protection from the
civil authorities, determined to resort to arms, to defend themselves
and their families from the further aggressions of their persecutors.
They accordingly repaired to Benezet Hall, one of their public buildings
in South Seventh Street, with a supply of fire arms and ammunition,
determined to fire upon the assailants, and maintain their post or die
in the attempt. This fact became known to the leaders of the mob, and
the cry was raised to march for the hall, and make the attack. Thomas
Shipley who had mingled amongst the rioters, and apparently identified
himself with them, was now perfectly aware of all their designs; he knew
their numbers, he had seen the implements of destruction which they were
brandishing about them, and he was aware that the occurrence of such a
conflict would be attended with the most disastrous results, and might
be the beginning of hostilities which would terminate in the destruction
of the weaker party, or at least in a dreadful effusion of human blood.
Seeing the position in which the parties were now placed, he left the
ranks of the rioters, and ran at the top of his speed to the house in
which the colored people were collected, awaiting the approach of their
enemy. As he drew near, they were about coming out to meet their
assailants, highly excited by continued outrages, and determined to
defend themselves or die. At this unexpected moment, their protector
drew nigh; he raised his voice aloud, and addressed the multitude. He
deprecated the idea of a resort to physical force, as being calculated
to increase their difficulties, and to plunge them into general
distress, and entreated them to retire from the hall. His voice was
immediately recognized; the effect was electric; the whole throng knew
him as their friend; their fierce passions were calmed by the voice of
reason and admonition. They could not disregard his counsels; he had
come among them, at the dead hour of night, in the midst of danger and
trial, to raise his warning voice against a course of measures they were
about to pursue. They listened to his remonstrances, and retreated
before the mob had reached the building. At this juncture the Mayor and
his officers assembled in front of the hall, and by prompt and energetic
action succeeded in dispersing the mob, and through the information
received from Thomas Shipley, the ringleaders were secured and lodged in
prison.

The part which Thomas Shipley acted in the trying scenes so often
presented in our courts, during this unhappy period, has invested his
character with a remarkable degree of interest. It is probable that his
connection with the Pennsylvania Abolition Society was the means of
enlisting his talents and exertions in this important service.

The energy and zeal of our friend in his efforts for the relief of those
about to be deprived of their dearest rights, soon distinguished him as
the most efficient member of the Society, in this department of its
duties. So intense was his interest in all cases where the liberty of
his fellow-man was at issue, that, during a period of many years, he was
scarcely ever absent from the side of the unhappy victim, as he sat
before our judicial tribunals, trembling for his fate. The promptings of
interest, the pleasures and allurements of the world, the quiet
enjoyment of a peaceful home, were all cheerfully sacrificed, when his
services were demanded in these distressing cases. Often has he left the
business, in which his pecuniary interests were materially involved, to
stand by the unhappy fugitive in the hour of his extremity, with an
alacrity and a spirit which could only be displayed by one animated by
the loftiest principles and the purest philanthropy.

Who, that has ever witnessed one of these trying scenes, can forget his
manly and honest bearing, as he stood before the unrelenting and
arrogant claimant, watching with an eagle eye, every step of the process
by which he hoped to gain his victim? Who has not been struck with his
expressive glances toward the judge, when a doubtful point arose in the
investigation of the case? Who has not caught the lively expression of
delight which beamed from his countenance, when a fact was disclosed
which had a favorable bearing on the liberty of the captive? Who has not
admired the sagacity with which his inquiries were dictated, and the
tact and acumen with which he managed every part of his cause? His
principle was unhesitatingly to submit to existing laws, however unjust
their decrees might be, but to scan well the bearing of the facts and
principles involved in each case, and to see that nothing was wanting in
the chain of evidence, or in the legal points in question, fully to
satisfy the requisitions of law. If a doubtful point arose, he was
unwearied in investigating it, and devoted hours, days, and even weeks,
in the collection of testimony which he thought would have a favorable
influence on the prisoner.

Through his untiring vigilance, many victims have escaped from the hand
of the oppressor, whose title to freedom, according to the laws of this
commonwealth, was undoubted, and many others, whose enslavement was at
least questionable.

The time and labor expended by Thomas Shipley in protecting the
interests of his colored clients, would be almost incredible to those
who were not aware of his extraordinary devotion to the cause. The only
notice which can be found among his papers, of the various slave cases
in which he was engaged, is contained in a memorandum book, which he
commenced in the summer of 1835. In this book he has noted, in the order
of their occurrence, such instances of difficulty or distress as
demanded his interference, almost without a comment. I find from this
book, that his advice and assistance were bestowed in twenty-five cases,
from Seventh mo. 16th, to Eighth mo. 24th, 1836, a period of little more
than a month. A number of these cases required the writing of letters to
distant places; in some it was necessary for him to visit the parties
interested; and others demanded his personal attendance at court. This
perhaps, may be considered as a fair average of the amount of labor
which he constantly expended in this department of his benevolent
efforts; and when we consider the time occupied in the necessary duties
of his ordinary avocations, it must be evident that he possessed not
only extraordinary humanity, but uncommon activity and energy, to have
accomplished so much.

In the memorandum book referred to, under date of Twelfth mo., 1835, I
find the following note: "Spent eighteen days in the trial of A.
Hemsley, and his wife Nancy, and her three children, arrested at Mount
Holly, the husband claimed by Goldsborough Price, executor of Isaac
Boggs, of Queen Ann's county, Maryland, and the wife and children by
Richard D. Cooper, of the same county. John Willoughby, agent for both
claimants. B.R. Brown and B. Clarke, attorneys for the claimant, and
D.P. Brown, J.R. Slack, E.B. Cannon, and G.W. Camblos, for defendants.
After a full argument, in which a manumission was produced for Nancy,
from R.D. Cooper's father, she and her children were discharged, but her
husband was remanded; on which a certiorari was served on the judge, and
a habeas corpus placed in the sheriff's hands."

"Alexander was discharged by the Supreme Court, at Trenton, Third mo.
5th. The circumstances of the case, were briefly the following: The
woman and children had been regularly manumitted in Delaware by the
father of the claimant, while the title of the father to freedom was
less positive, though sufficiently clear to warrant a vigorous effort on
his behalf."

The first object of the counsel on the part of the alleged fugitive, was
to prove the manumission of the mother and children, and, as it was
thought, the necessary documents for that purpose were collected and
arranged. After the trial had proceeded, however, for a short time, the
attorney for the defendants discovered a defect in the testimony on this
point; the necessary papers, duly authenticated by the Governor or Chief
Justice of Delaware, were missing, and without them it was impossible to
make out the case. The fact was immediately communicated to Thomas
Shipley--he saw that the papers must be had, and that they could not be
procured without a visit to Dover, in Delaware. He at once determined to
repair thither in person, and obtain them. Without the knowledge of the
claimant's counsel, who might have taken advantage of the omission, and
hurried the case to a decision; he started on the evening of the sixth
day, and traveled as fast as possible to Dover, in the midst of a season
unusually cold and inclement. On the next morning inquiries were made in
all directions for friend Shipley; it was thought strange that he should
desert his post in the midst of so exciting and momentous a trial, and
at a time when his presence seemed to be particularly required. The
counsel for the prisoners, who were aware of his movements, proceeded
with the examination of witnesses as slowly as possible, in order to
allow time for procuring this important link in the chain of testimony,
and thus to procrastinate the period when they should be called upon to
sum up the case.

Fortunately, on the evening of the day on which Thomas Shipley set out
upon his journey, it was proposed to adjourn, and farther proceedings
were postponed until Second day morning. At the meeting of the court, in
the morning, the expected messenger was not there, and the ingenuity of
the counsel was taxed still farther to procrastinate the important
period. After three hours had been consumed in debate upon legal points,
he, who was so anxiously looked for, came hurrying through the crowd,
making his way toward the bench. His countenance and his movements soon
convinced the wondering spectators that he was the bearer of gratifying
news, and in a few minutes, the mystery of his absence was revealed, by
the production of a document which was the fruit of his effort. The
papers completely established the legal title of the mother and children
to their freedom, and placed them out of the reach of further
persecution. An attack of illness was the result of the extreme exertion
and fatigue endured by this devoted man, in his earnest advocacy of the
rights of these friendless beings.

The freedom of the husband and father, was, however, still in jeopardy.
If the decision of the court should be against him, he would be torn
from the bosom of his now joyful and emancipated family, and consigned
to a life of bondage. To avert this calamity, the counsel for the
prisoner suggested an expedient as humane as it was ingenious. He
proposed that a writ of certiorari which would oblige the judge to
remove the case to the Supreme Court and a habeas corpus from the Chief
Justice of the State, should both be in readiness when the decision of
the judge should be pronounced, in case that if it should be
unfavorable, the writs might be at once served, and the prisoner
remanded to the sheriff of the county, to be brought up before the
Supreme Court at Trenton for another trial.

To procure these writs, it was necessary to obtain the signature of the
chief justice of New Jersey, who resided at Newark, and again Thomas
Shipley was ready to enter with alacrity into the service. He saw the
importance of the measure, and that it would require prompt action,
inasmuch as the decision of the judge would probably be pronounced on
the following day. It fortunately happened that a friend was just about
leaving for Newark, in his own conveyance, and feeling an interest in
the case, he kindly invited friend Shipley to accompany him. They left
in the afternoon, traveled all night, and arrived at Newark by daylight
the following morning. The weary traveler was unwilling, however, to
retire to bed, although the night was exceedingly cold and tempestuous,
but he proceeded at once to the house of the chief justice. He called
the worthy judge from his bed, offering the importance of his business,
and the necessity of speedy action, as an apology for so unseasonable a
visit. Chief Justice Hornblower, on being informed of the circumstances
of the case, expressed his pleasure at having it in his power to accede
to his wishes and treated him with a respect and kindness which the
disinterested benevolence of his mission was calculated to inspire.

Having obtained the necessary papers, he left at once for Mount Holly,
where he arrived on the following day, in time to place the writs in the
hands of the sheriff, just before the decision of Judge H. was
pronounced. Had he consulted his ease or convenience, and deferred his
visit to Newark a few hours, or had he, as most men, under similar
circumstances would have done, reposed his weary limbs, after a cold and
dreary ride of eighty miles, in order to enable him to return with
renewed strength, he would have arrived too late to render this
meritorious effort effectual. As it was, he was there in time. The
judge, according to the expectation of the friends of the colored man,
gave his decision in favor of the slave-holders, and ordered poor
Alexander to be given up to the tender mercies of the exasperated
claimant. The decision sent a thrill of indignation through the anxious
and excited multitude, which perhaps, was never equalled amongst the
inhabitants of that quiet town. The friends of humanity had assembled
from all parts of the country to witness the proceedings in the case.
Many of them were personally acquainted with the prisoner; they knew him
to be a man of intelligence and integrity; he was an industrious and
orderly citizen, and was universally respected in the neighborhood. He
was now about to be made a slave, and was declared to be the property of
another. The father was about to be torn from his helpless children; the
husband in defiance of the Divine command, was to be wrested from the
fond embrace of his sorrowing wife, to spend his days in misery and
toil. And this was to be done before the eyes of those who had a just
regard for human rights, a hearty hatred of oppression. Is it wonderful,
that under such circumstances, there should have been a deep abhorrence
for the perpetrators of this outrage upon humanity, and a general
sympathy for the innocent captive?

But it was decreed that those feelings of honest indignation should be
speedily supplanted by the warm outpouring of public gratitude and joy.
While the feeling of the spectators was in this state of intense
interest and excitement, the judge, stern and inflexible in his
purposes, and the clan of greedy claimants ready to seize upon their
prey, the sheriff produced his writ of certiorari and handed it to the
court. It was instantly returned, and the judge who sat unmoved, by a
scene to which he was not unaccustomed, and conceiving, perhaps, that
his official dignity was impugned, persisted in his determination that
the prisoner should be handed over to the claimant. The prudence and
foresight of Thomas Shipley and his friends had provided, however, for
this anticipated difficulty. Happily for the prisoner, he was yet
embraced under the provision of that constitution, which secured to him
the protection of a habeas corpus, and this threw around him a shield
which his enemies could not penetrate. A writ of habeas corpus, signed
by the chief justice of the State and demanding the body of the
prisoner, before the Supreme Court at its next term, was now produced!

The astonished judge found himself completely foiled. He had exercised
his authority to its utmost limit, in support of the claims of his
slave-holding friends, and had given the influence of his station and
character, to bolster up the "patriarchal institution;" but it was all
in vain. Just as they supposed they had achieved a victory, they were
obliged with fallen crests, to succumb to the dictates of a higher
tribunal, and to see their victim conveyed beyond their reach in the
safe keeping of the sheriff.

In the Third month, (March,) the case was brought up before the Supreme
Court for final adjudication. In the meantime, Thomas Shipley adopted
vigorous measures to have the facts collected and arranged. He procured
the aid of an intelligent and humane friend of the cause, who resided
near Trenton, to attend, personally to the case, and secured the legal
services of Theodore Frelinghuysen, well known as one of the most gifted
and virtuous statesmen of the age, and as a warm and zealous friend of
the oppressed. Under these happy auspices, the case came before the
Supreme Court, and gave rise to a highly interesting and important
argument; in which the distinguished Frelinghuysen appeared as the
disinterested advocate of the prisoner, and urged upon the court his
claim to liberty, under the laws of New Jersey, in a speech which was
one of his most brilliant and eloquent efforts, and added another to the
many laurels which his genius and philanthropy have achieved.

The opinion of Chief Justice Hornblower was given at length, and is said
to have displayed a soundness and extent of legal knowledge, with a
spirit of mildness and humanity, well worthy of the highest judicial
tribunal of New Jersey.

By this decision, Alexander Helmsley was declared to be a freeman, and
returned with rejoicing into the bosom of his family, and to the
enjoyment of the rights and privileges of a free citizen.

Thus terminated this interesting case, which for several months agitated
the public mind of Burlington county, to an extent almost unequalled.

Such disinterested devotion to the defence of the rights of the
oppressed, had it been displayed only in the instance recited, would be
sufficient to enroll the name of Thomas Shipley on the list of the
benefactors of his race; but when we consider that, for a period of
twenty years, his history abounds in similar incidents, and that he
uniformly stood forth as the unflinching advocate of the oppressed,
regardless of the sacrifices which he was obliged to make on their
behalf, we are disposed to view him as one of that noble band whose
lives have been consecrated to deeds of charity and benevolence, and
whose names will illumine the moral firmament, so long as virtue and
truth shall command the homage of mankind.

Thomas Shipley was one of the founders of the American Anti-Slavery
Society, and was an active agent in those stirring movements which soon
aroused the nation to a full consideration of the enormities of Slavery.
He was a prominent member of the Anti-slavery Convention, which
assembled in this city in 1833, and a signer of their declaration of
sentiments.

During the last few years of his life, he was more devotedly engaged in
his abolition labors than at any previous period. It was his constant
desire to diffuse the principles which had been so fearlessly proclaimed
by the Convention, and to encourage the formation of Anti-slavery
societies throughout the sphere of his influence. He was one of the most
prominent members of the Philadelphia Anti-slavery Society, which was
formed through much opposition, in 1835, and he steadily adhered to its
meetings, notwithstanding the threats which were so loudly made by the
enemies of public order.

In the midst of the popular commotions and tumults, which marked the
progress of Anti-slavery principles, he stood calm and unmoved. Having
been long known as a firm friend of the rights of the colored man, and
being amongst the most efficient public advocates of his cause, he was
of course subjected to the revilings which were so liberally heaped upon
the Abolitionists at that time. His name was associated with that of
Tappan, Birney, Green, Jay, Garrison, and other leading Abolitionists,
who were singled out by slave-holders and their abettors as fit subjects
for the merciless attacks of excited mobs.

In several attempts which were made in this city to stir up the passions
of the ignorant against the advocates of human rights, his person and
property were openly threatened with assault. Such menaces failed,
however, to deter him from the steady performance of what he believed to
be a solemn duty. Being fully satisfied of the truth of the principles
which he had espoused, he relied with unwavering confidence upon Divine
power for their ultimate triumph, and for the protection of those who
advocated them. When his friends expressed their anxiety for his safety,
he always allayed their apprehensions, and evinced by the firmness and
benignity of his manner that he was divested of the fear of man, and
acted under the influence of that spirit which is from above.

The active part which Thomas Shipley took in Anti-slavery movements, did
not diminish his interest in the prosperity and usefulness of the old
Pennsylvania Society. He was a steady attendant on its meetings, and
exercised his wonted care on all subjects connected with its interests.

A short time previous to his death, his services were acknowledged by
his fellow-members, by his election to the office of president.

The incessant and fatiguing labors in which he was engaged, had sensibly
affected the vigor of a constitution naturally delicate, and rendered
him peculiarly liable to the inroads of disease. He was seized in the
autumn of 1836, with an attack of intermittent fever, which confined him
to the house for ten or twelve days, and very much reduced his strength;
while recovering from this attack, he experienced an accession of
disease which terminated his life in less than twenty-four hours. But a
few hours before his death, he inquired of his physicians as to the
probable issue of his case; when informed of his critical condition, he
received the intelligence with composure, and immediately requested Dr.
Atlee, who was by his side, to take down some directions in regard to
his affairs, on paper. In a few minutes after this, he quietly lapsed
into the sleep of death, in the morning, on the 17th of Ninth month,
1836.

His last words were, "I die at peace with all mankind, and hope that my
trespasses may be as freely forgiven, as I forgive those who have
trespassed against me."

To all who knew him well, of whatever class in the community, the
tidings of this unexpected event brought a personal sorrow. It was felt
that a man of rare probity and virtue had gone to his reward. But to the
colored people the intelligence of his death was at once startling and
confounding. Their whole community was bowed down in public lamentation,
for their warmest and most steadfast friend was gone.

They repaired in large numbers to the house of their benefactor to
obtain a last glance at his lifeless body. Parents brought their little
ones to the house of mourning, and as they gazed upon the features of
the departed, now inanimate in death, they taught their infant minds the
impressive lesson, that before them were the mortal remains of one who
had devoted his energies to the disenthralment of their race, and whose
memory they should ever cherish with gratitude and reverence. When the
day arrived for committing his remains to the grave the evidence of deep
and pervading sorrow among these wronged and outraged people was
strikingly apparent.

Thousands, whose serious deportment and dejected countenances evinced
that they were fully sensible of their loss, collected in the vicinity
of his dwelling, anxious to testify their respect for his memory. Theirs
was not the gaze of the indifferent crowd, which clusters around the
abodes of fashion and splendor, to witness the pomp and circumstance
attendant on the interment of the haughty or the rich. It was a solemn
gathering, brought together by the impulse of feeling, to mingle their
tears and lamentations at the grave of one whom they had loved and
revered as a protector and a friend.

When the hearse arrived at the quiet burial place in Arch street, where
the Friends for many generations have buried their dead, six colored men
carried the body to its last resting-place, and the silent tear of the
son of Africa over the grave of his zealous friend, was more expressive
of real affection than all the parade which is sometimes brought so
ostentatiously before the public eye. In the expressive words of the
leading newspaper of the day, "Aaron Burr was lately buried with the
honors of war. Thomas Shipley was buried with the honors of peace. Let
the reflecting mind pause in the honorable contrast."

As a public speaker Thomas Shipley was clear, cogent, sometimes
eloquent, and always impressive. He never attempted oratorical effect,
or studied harangues. He generally spoke extemporaneously, on the spur
of the occasion, and what he said came warm from the heart. It was the
simple and unadorned expression of his sentiments and feelings. He was,
however, argumentative and even logical, when the occasion required it.
When intensely interested, his eye was full of deep and piercing
expression.

Although his education had been limited, and his pursuits afforded him
but little leisure time, yet he indulged his fondness for reading, and
exhibited a refined literary taste in his selections. He has left
amongst his books and papers eight manuscript volumes of about one
hundred and fifty pages each, filled with selections, copied in his own
handwriting, and culled from the writings of many of the most gifted
authors, both in poetry and prose.

These extracts are generally of a moral and religious caste, and include
scraps from Young, Milton, Addison, Burns, Cowper, Watts, Akenside,
Pope, Byron, Hemans, and many others.

In the domestic and social circle, his conversation was animated and
instructive, and always tempered by that kindness and amenity of manners
which endeared him to his family and friends.

He was no bigot in religion. While a firm believer in the doctrines of
the Gospel as maintained by the orthodox Society of Friends, he yet held
that religion was an operative principle producing the fruits of
righteousness and peace, in all of whatever name, who are sincere
followers of our Lord Jesus Christ. In conclusion we may add, that more
than most men he bore about with him the sentiment of that old Roman,
"Nihil humanum alienum a me puto," while he added to it the higher
thought of the Christian, that he who loveth God loveth his brother
also. We need not dwell upon the life of such a man. To-day, after the
lapse of more than a generation, his memory is fresh and green in the
hearts of those who knew him, and who still survive to hand down to
their children the story of the trials of that eventful period in our
history.

_To the Memory of_


THOMAS SHIPLEY,


President of the Pennsylvania Abolition Society,


Who died on the 17th of Ninth mo., 1836, a devoted Christian and
Philanthropist.

  Gone to thy Heavenly Father's rest--
    The flowers of Eden round thee blowing!
  And, on thine ear, the murmurs blest
    Of Shiloah's waters softly flowing!
  Beneath that tree of life which gives
  To all the earth its healing leaves--
  In the white robe of angels clad,
    And wandering by that sacred river,
  Whose streams of holiness make glad
    The city of our God forever!


  Gentlest of spirits!--not for thee
    Our tears are shed, our sighs are given:
  Why mourn to know thou art a free
    Partaker of the joys of Heaven?
  Finished thy work, and kept thy faith
  In Christian firmness unto death--
  And beautiful as sky and earth,
    When Autumn's sun is downward going,
  The blessed memory of thy worth
    Around thy place of slumber glowing!


  But, wo for us I--who linger still
    With feebler strength and hearts less lowly,
  And minds less steadfast to the will
    Of Him, whose every work is holy!
  For not like thine, is crucified
  The spirit of our human pride:
  And at the bondman's tale of woe,
    And for the outcast and forsaken,
  Not warm like thine, but cold and slow,
    Our weaker sympathies awaken!


  Darkly upon our struggling way
    The storm of human hate is sweeping;
  Hunted and branded, and a prey,
    Our watch amidst the darkness keeping!
  Oh! for that hidden strength which can
  Nerve unto death the inner man!
  Oh--for thy spirit tried and true
    And constant in the hour of trial--
  Prepared to suffer or to do
    In meekness and in self-denial.


  Oh, for that spirit meek and mild,
    Derided, spurned, yet uncomplaining--
  By man deserted and reviled,
    Yet faithful to its trust remaining.
  Still prompt and resolute to save
  From scourge and chain the hunted slave!
  Unwavering in the truth's defence
    E'en where the fires of hate are burning,
  The unquailing eye of innocence
    Alone upon the oppressor turning!


  Oh, loved of thousands! to thy grave,
    Sorrowing of heart, thy brethren bore thee!
  The poor man and the rescued slave
    Wept as the broken earth closed o'er thee--
  And grateful tears, like summer rain,
  Quickened its dying grass again!--
  And there, as to some pilgrim shrine,
    Shall come the outcast and the lowly,
  Of gentle deeds and words of thine
    Recalling memories sweet and holy!


  Oh, for the death the righteous die!
    An end, like Autumn's day declining,
  On human hearts, as on the sky,
    With holier, tenderer beauty shining!
  As to the parting soul were given
    The radiance of an opening heaven!
  As if that pure and blessed light
    From off the eternal altar flowing,
  Were bathing in its upward flight
    The spirit to its worship going!




ROBERT PURVIS


Was born in Charleston, S.C. on the 4th day of August, 1810. His father,
William Purvis, was a native of Ross county, in Northumberland, England.
His mother was a free-born woman, of Charleston. His maternal
grandmother was a Moor; and her father was an Israelite, named Baron
Judah. Robert Purvis and his two brothers were brought to the North by
their parents in 1819. In Pennsylvania and New England he received his
scholastic education, finishing it at Amherst College. Since that time
his home has been in Philadelphia, or in the vicinity of that city.

His interest in the Anti-slavery cause began in his childhood, inspired
by such books as "Sandford and Merton," and Dr. Toney's "Portraiture of
Slavery," which his father put into his hands. His father, though
resident in a slave state, was never a slaveholder; but was heartily an
Abolitionist in principle. It was Robert Purvis' good fortune, before he
attained his majority, to make the acquaintance of that earnest and
self-sacrificing pioneer of freedom, Benjamin Lundy; and in conjunction
with him, was an early laborer in the anti-slavery field. He was a
member of the Convention held in Philadelphia in 1833, which formed the
American Anti-slavery Society; and among the signatures to its
Declaration of Sentiments, the name of Robert Purvis is to be seen; a
record of which his posterity to the latest generation may be justly
proud. During the whole period of that Society's existence he was a
member of it; and was also an active member and officer of The
Pennsylvania Anti-slavery Society. To the cause of the slave's freedom
he gave with all his heart his money, his time, his talents. Fervent in
soul, eloquent in speech, most gracious in manner, he was a favorite on
the platform of Anti-slavery meetings. High-toned in moral nature,
keenly sensitive in all matters pertaining to justice and integrity, he
was a most valuable coadjutor with the leaders of an unpopular reform;
and throughout the Anti-slavery conflict, he always received, as he
always deserved, the highest confidence and warm personal regard of his
fellow-laborers.

His faithful labors in aiding fugitive slaves cannot be recorded within
the limits of this sketch. Throughout that long period of peril to all
who dared to "remember those in bonds as bound with them," his house was
a well-known station on the Underground Rail Road; his horses and
carriages, and his personal attendance, were ever at the service of the
travelers upon that road. In those perilous duties his family heartily
sympathized with him, and cheerfully performed their share.

He has lived to witness the triumph of the great cause to which he
devoted his youth and his manhood; to join in the jubilee song of the
American slave; and the thanksgiving of the Abolitionists; and to
testify that the work of his life has been one "whose reward is in
itself."



JOHN HUNN.


Almost within the lions' den, in daily sight of the enemy, in the little
slave-holding State of Delaware, lived and labored the freedom-loving,
earnest and whole-souled Quaker abolitionist, John Hunn. His
headquarters were at Cantwell's Bridge, but, as an engineer of the
Underground Rail Road, his duties, like those of his fellow-laborer
Thomas Garrett, were not confined to that section, but embraced other
places, and were attended with great peril, constant care and expense.
He was well-known to the colored people far and near, and was especially
sought with regard to business pertaining to the Underground Rail Road,
as a friend who would never fail to assist as far as possible in every
time of need. Through his agency many found their way to freedom, both
by land and water.

The slave-holders regarding him with much suspicion, watched him
closely, and were in the habit of "breathing out threatenings and
slaughter" very fiercely at times. But Hunn was too plucky to be
frightened by their threats and menaces, and as one, commissioned by a
higher power to remember those in bonds as bound with them he remained
faithful to the slave. Men, women or children seeking to be unloosed
from the fetters of Slavery, could not make their grievances known to
John Hunn without calling forth his warmest sympathies. His house and
heart were always open to all such. The slave-holders evidently
concluded that Hunn could not longer be tolerated, consequently devised
a plan to capture him, on the charge of aiding off a woman with her
children.

[John Hunn and Thomas Garrett were conjointly prosecuted in this case,
and in the sketch of the latter, the trial, conviction, etc., are so
fully referred to, that it is unnecessary to do more than allude to it
here].

These noted Underground Rail Road offenders being duly brought before
the United States District Court, in May, 1848, Judge Taney, presiding,
backed by a thoroughly pro-slavery sentiment, obviously found it a very
easy matter to convict them, and a still easier matter to fine them to
the extent of every dollar they possessed in the world. Thousands of
dollars were swept from Hunn in an instant, and his family left utterly
destitute; but he was by no means conquered, as he deliberately gave the
court to understand in a manly speech, delivered while standing to
receive his sentence. There and then he avowed his entire sympathy with
the slave, and declared that in the future, as in the past, by the help
of God, he would never withhold a helping hand from the down-trodden in
the hour of distress. That this pledge was faithfully kept by Hunn,
there can be no question, as he continued steadfast at his post until
the last fetter was broken by the great proclamation of Abraham Lincoln.

He was not without friends, however, for even near by, dwelt a few
well-tried Abolitionists. Ezekiel Jenkins, Mifflin Warner, and one or
two others, whole-souled workers in the same cause with Hunn; he was
therefore not forgotten in the hour of his extremity.

Wishing to produce a sketch worthy of this veteran, we addressed him on
the subject, but failed to obtain all the desired material. His reasons,
however, for withholding the information which we desired were
furnished, and, in connection therewith, a few anecdotes touching
Underground Rail Road matters coming under his immediate notice, which
we here take great pleasure in transcribing.


    BEAUFORT, S.C. 11th mo. 7th, 1871.

    WM. STILL, DEAR FRIEND:--In thy first letter thee asked for my
    photograph as well as for an opinion of the book about to be
    edited by thyself. I returned a favorable answer and sent
    likeness, as requested. I incidentally mentioned that, probably
    some of my papers might be of service to thee. The papers
    alluded to had no reference to myself; but consisted of
    anecdotes and short histories of some of the fugitives from the
    hell of American Slavery, who gave me a call, as engineer of the
    Underground Rail Road in the State of Delaware, and received the
    benefit of my advice and assistance.

    I was twenty-seven years-old when I engaged in the Underground
    Rail Road business, and I continued therein diligently until the
    breaking up of that business by the Great Rebellion. I then came
    to South Carolina to witness the uprising of a nation of slaves
    into the dignity and privileges of mankind.

    Nothing can possibly have the same interest to me. Therefore, I
    propose to remain where this great problem is in the process of
    solution; and to give my best efforts to its successful
    accomplishment. In this matter the course that I have pursued
    thus far through life has given me solid satisfaction. I ask no
    other reward for any efforts made by me in the cause, than to
    feel that I have been of use to my fellow-men.

    No other course would have brought peace to my mind; then why
    should any credit be awarded to me; or how can I count any
    circumstance that may have occurred to me, in the light of a
    sacrifice? If a man pursues the only course that will bring
    peace to his own mind, is he deserving of any credit therefor?
    Is not the reward worth striving for at any cost? Indeed it is,
    as I well know.

    Would it be well for me, entertaining such sentiments, to sit
    down and write an account of my sacrifices? I think not.
    Therefore please hold me excused. I am anxious to see thy book,
    and will forward the price of one as soon as I can ascertain
    what it is.

    Please accept my thanks for thy kind remembrance of me. I am now
    fifty-three years old, but I well remember thy face in the
    Anti-slavery Office in Fifth street, when I called on business
    of the Underground Rail Road. Our mutual friend, S.D. Burris,
    was the cause of much uneasiness to us in those times. It
    required much trouble, as well as expense to save him from the
    slave-traders. I stood by him on the auction-block; and when I
    stepped down, they thought they had him sure. Indeed he thought
    so himself for a little while. But we outwitted them at last, to
    their great chagrin. Those were stirring times, and the people
    of Dover, Delaware, will long remember the time when S.D. Burris
    was sold at public sale for aiding slaves to escape from their
    masters, and was bought by the Pennsylvania Anti-slavery
    Society. I remain very truly thy friend,

    JOHN HUNN.

THE CASE OF MOLLY, A SLAVE, BELONGING TO R---- B----, OF SMYRNA,
DELAWARE.


BY JOHN HUNN, ENGINEER OF THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD.


Molly escaped from her master's farm, in Cecil county, Maryland, and
found a place of refuge in the house of my cousin, John Alston, near
Middletown, Delaware. The man-hunters, headed by a constable with a
search warrant, took her thence and lodged her in New Castle Jail. This
fact was duly published in the county papers, and her master went after
his chattel, and having paid the expenses of her capture took immediate
possession thereof.

She was hand-cuffed, and, her feet being tied together, she was placed
in the wagon. Before she left the jail, the wife of the sheriff gave her
a piece of bread and butter, which her master kicked out of her hand,
and swore that bread and butter was too good for her. After this act her
master took a drink of brandy and drove off.

He stopped at a tavern about four miles from New Castle and took another
drink of brandy. He then proceeded to Odessa, then called Cantwell's
Bridge, and got his dinner and more brandy, for the day was a cold one.
He had his horse fed, but gave no food to his human chattel, who
remained in the wagon cold and hungry. After sufficient rest for himself
and horse he started again. He was now twelve miles from home, on a good
road, his horse was gentle, and he himself in a genial mood at the
recovery of his bond-woman. He yielded to the influence of the liquor he
had imbibed and fell into a sound sleep. Molly now determined to make
another effort for her freedom. She accordingly worked herself gradually
over the tail board of the wagon, and fell heavily upon the frozen
ground. The horse and wagon passed on, and she rolled into the bushes,
and waited for deliverance from her bonds. This came from a colored man
who was passing that way. As he was neither a priest nor a Levite, he
took the rope from her feet and guided her to a cabin near at hand,
where she was kindly received. Her deliverer could not take the
hand-cuffs off, but promised to bring a person, during the evening, who
could perform that operation. He fulfilled his promise, and brought her
that night to my house, which was in sight of the one whence she had
been taken to New Castle Jail.

I had no fear for her safety, as I believed that her master would not
think of looking for her so near to the place where she had been
arrested. Molly remained with us nearly a month; but, seeing fugitives
coming and going continually, she finally concluded to go further North.
I wrote to my friend, Thomas Garrett, desiring him to get a good home
for Molly. This he succeeded in doing, and a friend from Chester county,
Pennsylvania, came to my house and took Molly with him. She remained in
his family more than six months.

In the mean time the Fugitive Slave Law was passed by Congress, and
several fugitives were arrested in Philadelphia and sent back to their
masters. Molly, hearing of these doings, became uneasy, and finally
determined to go to Canada. She arrived safely in the Queen's Dominions,
and felt at last that she had escaped from the hell of American Slavery.

Molly described her master as an indulgent one when sober, but when he
was on a "spree" he seemed to take great delight in tormenting her. He
would have her beaten unmercifully without cause, and then have her
stripes washed in salt water, then he would have her dragged through the
horse pond until she was nearly dead. This last operation seemed to
afford him much pleasure. When he became sober he would express regret
at having treated her so cruelly. I frequently saw this master of
Molly's, and was always treated respectfully by him. He would have his
"sprees" after Molly left him.

AN ACCOUNT OF THE ESCAPE FROM SLAVERY OF SAMUEL HAWKINS AND FAMILY, OF
QUEEN ANNE'S COUNTY, MARYLAND, ON THE UNDERGROUND RAIL ROAD, IN THE
STATE OF DELAWARE.


BY JOHN HUNN.


On the morning of the 27th of 12th month (December), 1845, as I was
washing my hands at the yard pump of my residence, near Middletown, New
Castle county, Delaware, I looked down the lane, and saw a covered wagon
slowly approaching my house. The sun had just risen, and was shining
brightly (after a stormy night) on the snow which covered the ground to
the depth of six inches. My house was situated three quarters of a mile
from the road leading from Middletown to Odessa, (then called Cantwell's
Bridge.) On a closer inspection I noticed several men walking beside the
wagon. This seemed rather an early hour for visitors, and I could not
account for the circumstance. When they reached the yard fence I met
them, and a colored man handed me a letter addressed to Daniel Corbit,
John Alston or John Hunn; I asked the man if he had presented the letter
to either of the others to whom it was addressed; he said, no, that he
had not been able to see either of them. The letter was from my cousin,
Ezekiel Jenkins, of Camden, Delaware, and stated that the travelers were
fugitive slaves, under the direction of Samuel D. Burris (who handed me
the note). The party consisted of a man and his wife, with their six
children, and four fine-looking colored men, without counting the pilot,
S.D. Burris, who was a free man, from Kent county, Delaware.

This was the first time that I ever saw Burris, and also the first time
that I had ever been called upon to assist fugitives from the hell of
American Slavery. The wanderers were gladly welcomed, and made as
comfortable as possible until breakfast was ready for them. One man, in
trying to pull his boots off, found they were frozen to his feet; he
went to the pump and filled them with water, thus he was able to get
them off in a few minutes.

This increase of thirteen in the family was a little embarrassing, but
after breakfast they all retired to the barn to sleep on the hay, except
the woman and four children, who remained in the house. They were all
very weary, as they had traveled from Camden (twenty-seven miles),
through a snowstorm; the woman and four children in the wagon with the
driver, the others walking all the way. Most of them were badly
frost-bitten, before they arrived at my house. In Camden, they were
sheltered in the houses of their colored friends. Although this was my
first acquaintance with S.D. Burris, it was not my last, as he
afterwards piloted them himself, or was instrumental in directing
hundreds of fugitives to me for shelter.

About two o'clock of the day on which these fugitives arrived at my
house, a neighbor drove up with his daughter in a sleigh, apparently on
a friendly visit. I noticed his restlessness and frequent looking out of
the window fronting the road; but did not suppose, that he had come "to
spy out the land."

The wagon and the persons walking with it, had been observed from his
house, and he had reported the fact in Middletown. Accordingly, in half
an hour, another sleigh came up, containing a constable of Middletown,
William Hardcastle, of Queen Ann's county, Maryland, and William
Chesnut, of the same neighborhood. I met them at the gate, and the
constable handed me an advertisement, wherein one thousand dollars
reward was offered for the recovery of three runaway slaves, therein
described.

The constable asked me if they were in my house? I said they were not!
He then asked me if he might search the house? I declined to allow him
this privilege, unless he had a warrant for that purpose. While we stood
thus conversing, the husband of the woman with the six children, came
out of a house near the barn, and ran into the woods. The constable and
his two companions immediately gave chase, with many halloos! After
running more than a mile through the snow, the fugitive came toward the
house; I went to meet him, and found him with his back against the
barn-yard fence, with a butcher's knife in his hand. The man hunters
soon came up, and the constable asked me to get the knife from the
fugitive. This I declined, unless the constable should first give me his
pistol, with which he was threatening to shoot the man. He complied with
my request, and the fugitive handed me the knife. Then he produced a
pass, properly authenticated, and signed by a magistrate of Queen Ann's
county, Maryland, certifying that this man was free! and that his name
was Samuel Hawkins.

William Hardcastle now advanced, and said that he knew the man to be
free; but that he was accused of running away with his wife and children
who were slaves. He also said, that this man had two boys with him, who
belonged to a neighbor of his, named Charles Wesley Glanding, and that
the four other children and mother belonged to Catharine Turner, of
Queen Ann's county, Maryland. Hardcastle further expressed his belief,
that this man knew where his wife and children were at that time, and
insisted that he should go before a magistrate in Middletown, and be
examined in regard thereto. He also expressed doubts as to the
genuineness of this pass, and wished the man to go to Middletown on that
account also. As there was no other course to pursue under the
circumstances, I had my sleigh brought out, and we all went to
Middletown, before my friend, William Streets, who was then in
commission as a magistrate. It was now after dark of this short winter's
day. Soon after our arrival at the office of William Streets, Hardcastle
put his arm very lovingly around the neck of the colored man, Samuel
Hawkins, and drew him into another room. In a short time, Samuel came
out, and told me that Hardcastle had agreed, that if he, Hawkins, would
give up his two older boys, who belonged to Charles Wesley Glanding;
then he might pursue his journey with his wife and four children. I
asked him if he believed Hardcastle would keep his promise? He replied:
"Yes! I do not think master William would cheat me." I assured him that
he would cheat him, and that the offer was made for the purpose of not
only getting the two older boys (fourteen and sixteen years of age), but
his wife and other children to the office, when all of them would be
taken together to the jail, in New Castle. Samuel thought differently,
and at his request, I wrote to my wife for the delivery of the family of
Samuel Hawkins to the constable. They were soon forthcoming, and on
their arrival at the office, a commitment was made out for the whole
party. Samuel and his two older sons were hand-cuffed, amidst many tears
and lamentations, and they all went off under charge of the man-hunters,
to New Castle jail, a distance of eighteen miles.

William Streets committed the whole party as fugitives from Slavery,
while the husband (Samuel), was a free man. This was done on account of
the detestation of the wicked business, as much as on account of his
friendship for me.

On their arrival at the jail, about midnight, the sheriff was aroused,
and the commitment shown to him; after reading it, he asked Samuel if he
was a slave? He said no, and showed his pass (which had been pronounced
genuine by the magistrate). The sheriff hereupon told them, that the
commitment was not legal, and would not hold them lawfully. It was now
first day (Sunday), and the man-hunters were in a quandary.

The constable finally agreed to go back and get another commitment, if
the sheriff would take the party into the jail until his return;
Hardcastle also urged the sheriff to adopt this plan. Accordingly they
were taken into the jail.

The sheriff's daughter had heard her father's conversation with the
constable, accordingly she sent word on First-day morning, to my revered
friend, Thomas Garrett, of Wilmington, five miles distant, in regard to
the matter, inviting him to see the fugitives. Early on Second day
morning (Monday), Thomas went over with John Wales, attorney at law. The
latter soon obtained a writ of habeas corpus from Judge Booth of New
Castle, which was served upon the sheriff; who, therefore, brought the
whole party before Judge Booth, who discharged them at once, as being
illegally detained by the sheriff. Thomas Garrett, with the consent of
the judge, then hired a carriage to take the woman and four children
over to Wilmington, Samuel and the two older boys walked, so they all
escaped from the man-hunters. They went from Wilmington to Byberry, and
settled near the farm of Robert Purvis. Samuel Hawkins and wife have
since died, but their descendants still live in that neighborhood, under
the name of Hackett.

Soon after the departure of the fugitives from New Castle jail, the
constable arrived with new commitments from William Streets, and
presented them in due form to the sheriff; who informed him that they
had been liberated by order of Judge Booth! A few hours after, William
Hardcastle arrived from Philadelphia, expecting to take Samuel Hawkins
and his family to Queen Ann's county, Maryland. Judge of his
disappointment at finding they were beyond his control--absolutely gone!
They returned to Middletown in great anger, and threatened to prosecute
William Streets for his participation in the affair.

After the departure of the Hawkins family from Middletown, I returned
home to see what had become of S.D. Burris and his four men. I found
them taking some solid refreshment, preparatory to taking a long walk in
the snow. They left about nine P.M., for Wilmington. I sent by S.D.
Burris a letter to Thomas Garrett, detailing the arrest and commitment
of S. Hawkins and family to New Castle jail. They all arrived safely in
Wilmington before daylight next morning. Burris waited to hear the
result of the expedition to New Castle; and actually had the pleasure of
seeing S. Hawkins and family arrive in Wilmington.

Samuel Burris returned to my house early on Third day morning, with a
letter from Thomas Garrett, giving me a description of the whole
transaction. My joy on this occasion was great! and I returned thanks to
God for this wonderful escape of so many human beings from the
charnel-house of Slavery.

Of course this circumstance excited the ire of many pro-slavery editors
in Maryland. I had copies of several papers sent me, wherein I was
described as a man unfit to live in a civilized community, and calling
upon the inhabitants of Middletown to expel such a dangerous person from
that neighborhood! They also told exactly where I lived, which enabled
many a poor fugitive escaping from the house of bondage, to find a
hearty welcome and a resting-place on the road to liberty. Thanks be to
God! for His goodness to me in this respect.

The trial which ensued from the above, came off before Chief Justice
Taney, at New Castle. My revered friend, Thomas Garrett, and myself,
were there convicted of harboring fugitive slaves, and were fined
accordingly, to the extent of the law; Judge Taney delivering the
sentence. A detailed account of said trial, will fully appear in the
memoirs of our deceased friend, Thomas Garrett.

SAMUEL RHOADS


Was born in Philadelphia, in 1806, and was through life a consistent
member of the Society of Friends. His parents were persons of great
respectability and integrity. The son early showed an ardent desire for
improvement, and was distinguished among his young companions for warm
affections, amiable disposition, and genial manners, rare purity and
refinement of feeling, and a taste for literary pursuits. Preferring as
his associates those to whom he looked for instruction and example, and
aiming at a high standard, he won a position, both mentally and
socially, superior to his early surroundings. With a keen sense of
justice and humanity, he could not fail to share in the traditional
opposition of his religious society to slavery, and to be quickened to
more intense feeling as the evils of the system were more fully revealed
in the Anti-slavery agitation which in his early manhood began to stir
the nation.

A visit to England, in 1834, brought him into connection and friendship
with many leading Friends in that country, who were actively engaged in
the Anti-slavery movement, and probably had much to do with directing
his attention specially to the subject. Once enlisted, he never wavered,
but as long as slavery existed by law in our country his influence, both
publicly and privately, was exerted against it. He was strengthened in
his course by a warm friendship and frequent intercourse with the late
Abraham L. Pennock, a man whose unbending integrity and firm allegiance
to duty were equalled only by his active benevolence, broad charity, and
rare clearness of judgment. Samuel Rhoads, like him, while sympathizing
with other phases of the Anti-slavery movement, took especial interest
in the subject of abstaining from the use of articles produced by slave
labor. Believing that the purchase of such articles, by furnishing to
the master the only possibility of pecuniary profit from the labor of
his slaves, supplied one motive for holding them in bondage, and that
the purchaser thus became, however unwittingly, a partaker in the guilt,
he felt conscientiously bound to withhold his individual support as far
as practicable, and to recommend the same course to others.

His practical action upon these views began about the year 1841, and was
persevered in, at no small expense and inconvenience, till slavery
ceased in this country to have a legal existence. About this time he
united with the American Free Produce Association, which had been formed
in 1838, and in 1845 took an active part in the formation of the Free
Produce Association of Friends of Philadelphia, Y.M.; both associations
having the object of promoting the production by free labor of articles
usually grown by slaves, particularly of cotton. Agents were sent into
the cotton States, to make arrangements with small planters, who were
growing cotton by the labor of themselves and their families without the
help of slaves, to obtain their crops, which otherwise went into the
general market, and could not be distinguished. A manufactory was
established for working this cotton, and a limited variety of goods were
thus furnished. In all these operations Samuel Rhoads aided efficiently
by counsel and money.

In 1846, "The Non-slave-holder," a monthly periodical, devoted mainly to
the advocacy of the Free Produce cause, was established in Philadelphia,
edited by A.L. Pennock, S. Rhoads, and George W. Taylor. It was
continued five years, for the last two of which Samuel Rhoads conducted
it alone. He wrote also a pamphlet on the free labor question. From
July, 1856 to January, 1867 he was Editor of the "Friends' Review," a
weekly paper, religious and literary, conducted in the interest of his
own religious society, and in this position he gave frequent proofs of
interest in the slave, keeping his readers well advised of events and
movements bearing upon the subject.

While thus awake to all forms of anti-slavery effort, his heart and hand
were ever open to the fugitive from bondage, who appealed to him, and
none such were ever sent away empty. Though not a member of the
Vigilance Committee, he rendered it frequent and most efficient aid,
especially during the dark ten years after the passage of the Fugitive
Slave Law.

A second visit to England, in 1847, had enlarged his connection and
correspondence with anti-slavery friends there, and in addition to his
own contributions, very considerable sums of money were transmitted to
him, especially through A.H. Richardson, for the benefit of the
fugitives. Often when the treasury of the Committee ran low, he came
opportunely to their relief with funds sent by his English friends,
while his sympathy and encouragement never failed. The extent of his
assistance in this direction was known to but few, but by them its value
was gratefully acknowledged. None rejoiced more than he in the overthrow
of American slavery, though its end came in convulsion and bloodshed, at
which his spirit revolted, not by the peaceful means through which he
with others had labored to bring it about. He had some years before been
active in preparing a memorial to Congress, asking that body to make an
effort to put an end to slavery in the States, by offering from the
national treasury, to any State or States which would emancipate the
slaves therein, and engage not to renew the system, compensation for
losses thus sustained. This proposition was made, not as admitting any
_right_ of the masters to compensation; but on the ground that the whole
nation, having shared in the guilt of maintaining slavery, might justly
share also in whatever pecuniary loss might follow its abandonment.

This memorial was sent to Congress, but elicited no response; and in the
fulness of time, the nation paid even in money many times any possible
price that could have been demanded under this plan. Samuel Rhoads died
in 1868.



GEORGE CORSON


Was born in Plymouth township, Montgomery county, Pennsylvania, January
24th, 1803. He was the son of Joseph and Hannah Corson. He was married
January 24th, 1832, to Martha, daughter of Samuel and Susanna Maulsby.

There were perhaps few more devoted men than George Corson to the
interests of the oppressed everywhere. The slave, fleeting from his
master, ever found a home with him, and felt while there that no
slave-hunter would get him away until every means of protection should
fail. He was ever ready to send his horse and carriage to convey them on
the road to Canada, or elsewhere towards freedom. His home was always
open to entertain the anti-slavery advocates, and being warmly supported
in the cause by his excellent wife, everything which they could do to
make their guests comfortable was done. The Burleighs, J. Miller McKim,
Miss Mary Grew, F. Douglass, and others will not soon forget that
hospitable home. It is to be regretted that he died before the
emancipation of the slaves, which he had so long labored for, arrived.
In this connection it may not be improper to state that simultaneously
with his labors in the Anti-slavery cause, he was also laboring with
zeal in the cause of Temperance. Of his efforts in that direction
through nearly thirty years, our space will not allow us to speak. His
life and labors were a daily protest against the traffic of rum. There
is also another phase of his character which should be mentioned.
Whenever he saw animals abused, horses beaten, he instantly interfered,
often at great risk of personal harm from the brutal drivers about the
lime quarries and iron ore diggings. So firm, so determined was he, that
the cruellest ruffian felt that he must yield or confront the law. Take
him all for all, there will rarely be found in one man more universal
benevolence and justice than was possessed by the subject of this
notice.

Hiram Corson, brother of the subject of this sketch, and a faithful
co-laborer in the cause, in response to a request that he would furnish
a reminiscence touching his brother's agency in assisting fugitives,
wrote as follows:


    _November 1st_, 1871.

    DEAR ROBERT:--Wm. Still wishes some account of the case of the
    negro slave taken from our neighborhood some years ago, after an
    attempt by my brother George to release him. (About thirty years
    ago.) George had been on a visit to our brother Charles, living
    at the fork of the Skippack and Perkiomen Creeks, in this
    county, and on his return, late in the afternoon, while coming
    along an obscure road, not the main direct road, he came up to a
    man on horseback, who was followed at a distance of a few feet
    by a colored man with a rope tied around his neck, and the other
    end held by the person on horseback.

    George had had experience with those slave-drivers before, as in
    the case of John and James Lewis, and withal had become deeply
    interested in the Anti-slavery cause. He, therefore, inquired of
    the mounted man, what the other had done that he was to be thus
    treated. He quietly remarked that he was his slave and had run
    away. He then asked by what authority he held him. He said by
    warrant from Esquire Vanderslice. Indignant at this great
    outrage, my brother hurried on to Norristown, and waited his
    arrival with a process to arrest him. The slave-master,
    confident in his rights, bold in the country of those pretended
    freemen, who were ever ready to kiss the rod of Slavery, came
    slowly riding into Norristown, just before sunset, with the rope
    still fast to the slave's neck. He was immediately taken before
    a Justice of the Peace, whose name I do not now remember. The
    people gathered around; anxious inquiries were made as to the
    person who had the audacity to question the right of this quiet,
    peaceable man to do with his slave as he pleased. Great scorn
    was expressed for the busy Abolitionists. Much sympathy given to
    the abused slave owner. It was soon decided, by the aid of a
    volunteer lawyer, whose sons have since fought the battle for
    freedom, that the slave-owner had a right to take his slave
    whereever, and in whatever way he pleased, through the country,
    and not only that, but at his call for help it was the bounden
    duty of every man, called upon, to aid him; and the person who
    had the audacity to stop him was threatened with punishment.

    But George's blood was up, so pained was he at the sight of a
    man, a poor man, a helpless man, being dragged through from
    Pennsylvania with a halter around his neck, that, amidst the
    jeers and insults of the debased crowd, he denounced Slavery,
    its aiders and abettors, in tones of scorn and loathing. But the
    man thief was left with his prey. Through the advice of those
    who stood by the slave laws and who knelt before the slave
    power, as personified by that hunter of slaves, the rope was
    taken from the neck, and the man guarded while the master
    regaled himself. That night he disappeared with his man.

    I can also give a few particulars of the escape of the Gorsuch
    murderers, from Norristown on their way to Canada. There should
    be a portrait of Daniel Ross, and a history of his labors during
    twenty or more years. Hundreds were entertained in his humble
    home, and it was in his home that the Gorsuch murderer was
    secreted. He must not be left out. I can also get the whole
    history, escape, capture, trial, conviction and redemption of
    James and John Lewis, and one other. They were captured here
    within sight of our house. George Corson, Esq., published it
    all, about ten years ago. Respectfully,

Mr. Still has asked me to record the part that my father bore in the
Anti-slavery enterprise, as it began and grew in this city. I comply,
because the history of that struggle would be very incomplete, if from
it were omitted the peculiar work which my father's position here shaped
for him. Yet I can only indicate his work, not portray it; tell some of
its elements, and then leave them to the moral sympathies of the reader
to upbuild. For, first, his labor for the love of man was evenly
distributed through the mould and movements of his entire life; and from
a perpetual current of nourishing blood, one cannot name those
particular atoms that are busiest or richest to sustain vitality. And,
further, if I could hear his voice, it would forbid any detailed account
of what he accomplished and endured. It was all done unobtrusively in
his life; bravely, defiantly, in regard of the evil to be met and
mastered, but as unconsciously in regard of himself as every conviction
works, when it is as broad as the entire spiritual life of a man and has
his entire spiritual force to give it expression. I know, therefore,
that while I should be permitted to mention so much of his service as
the history of the conflict might demand, I should be forbidden all tale
of sacrifice and labor that mere personal narrative would include; and I
ask now only this: What peculiar influence did he exert for the
furtherance of the cause which so largely absorbed his labor and life?
Did he contribute anything to it stamped with the signature of so clear
an individuality that no other man could have contributed quite the
same? To this I maintain an affirmative answer; and in witness of its
truth, I sketch the general course of his life, that through it we may
find those elements of his character which intuitively ranged him on the
side of the slave.

When my father came to Philadelphia in 1834, his sentiments in regard to
Slavery were those held generally in the North--an easy-going wish to
avoid direct issue with the South on a question supposed to be
peculiarly theirs. But the winds of Heaven owned to no decorous limit in
Mason and Dixon's line; and there were larger winds blowing than
these--winds rising in the vast laboratories of the general human heart,
and destined to sweep into all the vast spaces of human want and woe.
The South was finding, through her blacks' perpetual defiance of torture
and death for freedom, that there was perhaps something, even in a
negro, which most vexatiously refused to be counted in with the figures
of the auctioneer's bill of sale; and now the North's lesson was coming
to her--that the soul of a century's civilization was still less
purchasable than the soul of a slave. A growing feeling of humanity was
stirring through the northern States. It was not the work, I think, of
any man or body of men; it was rather itself a creative force, and made
men and bodies of men the results of its awakening influence. To such a
power, my father's nature was quickly responsive. Both his head and his
heart recognized the terrible wrongs of the enslaved, and the urgency
with which they pressed for remedy; but where was the means? From the
first, he felt that the movement which brought Freedom and Slavery
fairly into the field and squarely against each other, threw unnecessary
obstacles in its own way by the violence with which it was begun and
prosecuted. If he were to work at all in the cause, he determined to
work within the limits of recognized law. The Colonization Society held
out a good hope; at least, he could see no other as close to the true
but closer to the feasible; and, after connecting himself with it, he
seems to have been content for a while on the score of political
matters, and to have devoted himself to what he had adopted as his chief
purpose in life. This was, enlarging the sphere of female education, and
giving it a more vigorous tone. To this he tasked all his abilities. His
convictions on the subject were very earnest; his strength of character
sufficient to bear them out; so that, in a short time, he was able to
establish his school so firmly in the respect of this community, that,
for twenty-five years, all the odium that his activity in the
Anti-slavery cause drew upon him did not for a moment abate the public
confidence accorded to his professional power.

It was in 1836, in one of his vacations, that his mind was violently
turned inwards to re-examine his status upon the Anti-slavery question.
He happened to be visiting his old college-friend, Salmon P. Chase, at
Cincinnati, and, fortunately for the spiritual life of both men, it was
at the time of the terrible riots that broke up the press of John G.
Birney. Both being known as already favoring the cause of the slave,
they stood in much peril for several days; but when the dark time was
passed, the clearness that defined their sentiments was seen to be worth
all the personal danger that had bought it. Self-delusion on the subject
was no longer possible. The deductions from the facts were as plain as
the facts themselves. The two friends took counsel together, and adopted
the policy from which thenceforward neither ever swerved. A great cloud
was rolled from their eyes. In all this turmoil of riot, they saw on the
one side, indeed, a love of man great in its devotion; but on the other,
a moral deadness in the North so profound and determined that it
threatened thus brutally any voice that would disturb it. Their duty,
then, was evident: to fling all the forces of their lives, and by all
social and political means, right against this inertness, and shatter it
if they could. To Mr. Chase, the course of things gave the larger
political work; to my father, the larger social. His diary records how
amazed he was, when he returned to Philadelphia, at his former
blindness, and how thankful to the spirit of love that had touched and
cleansed his eyes that he might see God's image erect. He knew now that
his lot had been cast in the very stronghold of apathy, the home of a
lukewarm spirit, which, not containing anything positive to keep it
close to the right, let its sullen negativeness gravitate towards the
wrong. It will be difficult to make coming generations understand, not
the flaming antagonism to humanity, but the more brutal avoidance of it
that ruled the political tone in this latitude, from 1836 to 1861. I
have thought of the word _bitterness_, as expressing it; but though that
might convey somewhat of its recoil when disturbed, it pictures nothing
of its inhuman solicitude against all disturbance. Conservatism, it was
called; and certainly it did conserve the devil admirably. At the South,
one race of men were so basely wielding a greater physical power over
another race of men, as to crush from them the attributes of
self-responsible creatures; Philadelphia, the city of the North nearest
the wrong, made no plea for humanity's claims. It went on, this
monstrous abrogation of everything that lends sanctity to man's
relations on earth, till slaves were beasts, with instincts annihilated,
and masters demons, with instincts reversed; Philadelphia made no plea
for the violated rhythm of life on either side. Even the Church betrayed
its mission, and practically aided in stamping out from millions the
spirit that related them to the Divine; still Philadelphia made no plea
for God's love in his humanity. Utterly insensible to the most piercing
appeals that man can make to man, she loved her hardness, clung to it;
and if, now and then, a voice from the North blew down, warningly as a
trumpet, the great city turned sluggishly in her bed of spiritual and
political torpor, and cried: Let be, let be! a little more slumber! a
little more folding of the hands to my moral death-sleep!

This souring of faith, this half-paralysis of the heart's beating, this
blurring of the intuitions that make manhood possible, were what my
father found here in that year of our Lord's grace, 1836. It will be
worth while to watch him move into the fight and bear his part in its
thickest, just to learn how largely history lays her humanitarian
advances on a few willing souls.

The means which lay readiest to his use for rousing the dormant spirit
of the city was his social position. And yet how hard, one would think,
it must have been to make this sacrifice. He came accredited by all the
claims of finished culture, a man consecrated to the scholar's life.[A]
Then, with the sensitiveness that springs from intellectual breeding,
one will look to see him shrink from conflict with the callous condition
of feeling around him. The glamour of book-lore will spread over it, and
hide it from his sight. He has a noble enough mission, at all events: to
raise the standard of educational culture in a city that hardly knows
the meaning of the term; and if any glimpse should come to him of the
lethargic inhumanity around him, he can afford to let it pass as a
glimpse--his look being fixed on the sacred heights which the scholar's
feet must tread.

[Footnote A: All that I here write of my father, I write equally of his
co-laborer in the same sphere of work--Rev. W.H. Furness; and if it is
true of others whom I did not know, then to their memory also I bear
this record of the two whose labors and characters it has been the
deepest privilege of my life to know so well.]

Ah, how his course, so different, proves to us that the true scholar is
always a scholar of truth. No matter what element of the public
sentiment he met--the listlessness of pampered wealth; the brutal
prejudice of some voting savage; the refined sneer of lettered
dilettanteism; the purposed aversion of trade or pulpit fearing
disturbed markets or pews;--he beat lustily and incessantly at all the
parts of the iron image of wrong sitting stolidly here with close-shut
eyes. No matter when it was, on holiday or working-day or Sabbath; at
home and abroad; in the parlor, the street, the counting-room; in his
school and in the Church;--he bore down on this apathy and its brood of
scorns like a west wind that sweeps through a city dying under weight of
miasma. And the wind might as well cease blowing yet not cease to be
wind, as my father's influence stop and himself live. It scattered the
good seed everywhere. How often have I heard him say, "I know nothing of
what the harvest will be; I am responsible only for the sowing." And
bravely went the sowing on, with the broadcast largesse of love. There
was no breeze of talk that did not carry the seeds;--to the wayside, for
from those that even chance upon the truth the fowls of the air cannot
take it all; to thin soil and among thorns, for no heart so feeble or
choked that will not find in a single day's growth of truth germination
for eternity; to stony places, for no cranny in the rocks that can hold
a seed but can be a home for riving roots;--"And other fell on good
ground and did bring forth fruit."

Thus it was primarily to rouse those of his own class that he labored,
to gall them into seeing (though they should turn again and rend him)
that moral supineness is moral decay, that the soul shrivels into
nothingness when wrong is acquiesced in, as surely as it is torn and
scattered by the furies let loose within it, when wrong is done. But
just there lay the difficulty and pain of his mission: that, from his
acknowledged standing in the literary world, and as a leader in the
interests of higher education, his path brought him into contact mainly
with the cultured, and it was among these that the pro-slavery spirit
ruled with its bitterest stringency. Not cultured: let us unsay the
word; rather, with the gloss and hard polish which reading and wealth
and the finer appointments of living can throw over spiritual arrest or
decay. Culture is a holy word, and dare be used of intellectual advance
only when the moral sympathies have kept equal step. It includes
something beyond an amateur sentiment; in favor of what we favor. If it
does not open the ear to every cry of humanity, struggling up or
slipping back, it is no culture properly so called, but a sham, a mask
of wax, a varnish with cruel glitter; and what a double wrath will be
poured on him who cracks the wax and the varnish, not only because of
the rude awakening, but because the crack shows the sham.

It is impossible for us now to realize what revenge this class dealt to
my father for twenty-five years. Consider their power of revenge. They
could not force a loss of property or of life, it is true; they made no
open assault in the street; their 'delicacy' held itself above common
vituperation. But they wielded a greater power than all these over a man
whose every accomplishment made him their equal, and they used it
without stint. They doomed him to the slow martyrdom of social scorn.
They shut their doors against him. They elbowed him from every position
to which he had a wish or a right, except public respect, and they could
not elbow him from that unless they pushed his character from its poise.
They cut him off from every friendly regard which would else have been
devotedly his, on that level of educated life, and limited him to
'solitary confinement' within himself. They compelled him to walk as if
under a ban or an anathema. Had he been a leper in Syrian deserts, or a
disciple of Jesus among Pharisees, he could not have been more utterly
banished from the region of homes and self-constituted piety. They
showered ineffable contempt upon him in every way consistent with their
littleness and--refinement. Slight, sneer, insult, all the myriad
indignities that only 'good society' can devise, these were what my
father received in return for his love and his work in love.

How little personal relation all this obloquy bore to him, let this
stand as evidence: that he not only continued his work, but daily gave
it more caustic energy and wider scope. As I have hinted, he did not, in
political matters, give in his adherence to that class of abolitionists
who, as he thought, threw away their best chances of success in refusing
to work within constitutional provisions. He was prouder that this
single community should call him "abolitionist," though it spat the word
at him, than if the whole earth should hail him with the kingliest
title; but he loved the name too well not to make it stand for some
practical fact, some feasible and organized effort. He believed that our
National Constitution did, indeed, hold many compromises with Slavery,
but was framed, in the majority of its provisions and certainly in the
totality of its spirit, in the interests of freedom; and that it only
needed enforcement by the choice of the ballot-box to bring the South
either to an amicable or a hostile settlement of the question. Which, he
did not ask or care. The duty of the present could not be mis-read; it
was written in _the vote_.

With these views, he gave much time and work to organizing in this
State, "The National Liberty Party," in 1840, and to securing from
Pennsylvania some of the seven thousand votes that were cast for John G.
Birney in that year throughout the Union. By the time another election
came, the party had swelled its numbers to seventy thousand. To
contribute his share towards this success, tract after tract, address
after address, were written and sent broadcast; meetings were convened,
committees formed, resolutions framed, speeches made, petitions and
remonstrances sent, public action fearlessly sifted and criticised; in
short, because he held a steady faith in men's humane promptings when
ultimately reached, he 'cried aloud' to them by every access, and
'spared not' to call them from their timidity and time-serving to manly
utterance through the ballot-box.

Of such appeals, his address of the "Liberty Party of Pennsylvania, to
the people of the State," issued in 1844, may stand as a sample. It is a
vivid portrayal of the slave power's insidious encroachments, and of its
monopolized guidance of the Government. It gathers up the national
statistics into groups, shows how new meaning is reflected from them
thus related, that all unite to illustrate the single fact of the
South's steady increase of power, her tightening grasp about the throat
of government, and her buffets of threat to the North when a weedling
palm failed to palsy fast enough. It warns northern voters of the
undertow that is drawing them, and adjures them, by every consideration
of political common sense, not to cast their ballots for either of the
pro-slavery candidates presented. The conclusion of this address is as
follows:



OUR OBJECT.



    "And now, fellow-citizens, you may ask, what is our object in
    thus exhibiting to you the alarming influence of the slave
    power? Do we wish to excite in your bosoms feelings of hatred
    against citizens of a common country? Do we wish to array the
    Free states against the Slave states in hostile strife? No,
    fellow-citizens. But we wish to show you that, while the slave
    states are inferior to us in free population, having not even
    one half of ours; inferior in morals, being the region of bowie
    knives and duels, of assassinations and lynch law; inferior in
    mental attainments, having not one-fourth of the number that can
    read and write; inferior in intelligence, having not one-fifth
    of the number of literary and scientific periodicals; inferior
    in the products of agriculture and manufactures, of mines, of
    fisheries, and of the forest; inferior, in short, in everything
    that constitutes the wealth, the honor, the dignity, the
    stability, the happiness, the true greatness of a nation,--it is
    wrong, it is unjust, it is absurd, that they should have an
    influence in all the departments of government so entirely
    disproportionate to our own. We would arouse you to your own
    true interests. We would have you, like men, firmly resolved to
    maintain your own rights. We would have you say to the
    South,--if you choose to hug to your bosom that system which is
    continually injuring and impoverishing you; that system which
    reduces two millions and a half of native Americans in your
    midst to the most abject condition of ignorance and vice,
    withholding from them the very key of knowledge; that system
    which is at war with every principle of justice, every feeling
    of humanity; that system which makes man the property of man,
    and perpetuates that relation from one generation to another;
    that system which tramples, continually, upon a majority of the
    commandments of the Decalogue; that system which could not live
    a day if it did not give one party supreme control over the
    persons, the health, the liberty, the happiness, the marriage
    relations, the parental authority and filial obligations of the
    other;--if you choose to cling to such a system, cling to it;
    but you shall not cross our line; you shall not bring that foul
    thing here. We know, and we here repeat it for the thousandth
    time to meet, for the thousandth time, the calumnies of our
    enemies, that while we may present to you every consideration of
    duty, we have no right, as well as no power, to alter your State
    laws. But remember, that slavery is the mere creature of local
    or statute law, and cannot exist out of the region where such
    law has force. 'It is so odious,' says Lord Mansfield, 'that
    nothing can be suffered to support it but _positive_ law.'

    "We would, therefore, say to you again, in the strength of that
    Constitution under which we live, and which no where
    countenances slavery, you shall not bring that foul thing here.
    You shall not force the corrupted and corrupting blood of that
    system into every vein and artery of our body politic. You shall
    not have the controlling power in all the departments of our
    government at home and abroad. You shall not so negotiate with
    foreign powers, as to open markets for the products of slave
    labor alone. You shall not so manage things at home, as every
    few years to bring bankruptcy upon our country. You shall not,
    in the apportionment of public moneys, have what you call your
    'property' represented, and thus get that which, by no right,
    belongs to you. You shall not have the power to bring your
    slaves upon our free soil, and take them away at pleasure; nor
    to reclaim them, when they, panting for liberty, have been able
    to escape your grasp; for we would have it said of us, as the
    eloquent Curran said of Britain, the moment the slave touches
    our soil, 'The ground on which he stands is holy, and
    consecrated to the Genius of UNIVERSAL EMANCIPATION.'

    "Thus, fellow-citizens, we come to _the great object of the
    Liberty Party_: ABSOLUTE AND UNQUALIFIED DIVORCE OF THE GENERAL
    GOVERNMENT FROM ALL CONNECTION WITH SLAVERY. We would employ
    every _constitutional_ means to eradicate it from our entire
    country, because it would be for the highest welfare of our
    entire country. We would have liberty established in the
    District, and in all the Territories.  *  *  We would have
    liberty of speech and of the press, which the Constitution
    guarantees to us. We would have the right of petition most
    sacredly regarded. We would secure to every man what the
    Constitution secures, 'The right of trial by jury.' We would do
    what we can for the encouragement and improvement of the colored
    race, and restore to them that inestimable right of which they
    have been so meanly, as well as unjustly, deprived, the RIGHT OF
    SUFFRAGE. We would look to the best interests of the country,
    and the _whole_ country, and not legislate for the good of an
    Oligarchy, the most arrogant that ever lorded it over an
    insulted people. We would have our commercial treaties with
    foreign nations regard the interests of the Free states. We
    would provide safe, adequate, and permanent markets for the
    produce of free labor. And, when reproached with slavery, we
    would be able to say to the world, with an open front and a
    clear conscience, our General Government has nothing to do with
    it, either to promote, to sustain, to defend, to sanction, or to
    approve.

    "Thus, fellow-citizens, you see our objects. You may now ask, by
    what means we hope to attain them. We answer, by POLITICAL
    ACTION. What is political action? It is _acting in a manner
    appropriate to those objects which we wish to secure through the
    agency of the different departments of Government_.  *  *  The
    only way in which we can act _constitutionally_, is to go to the
    ballot-box, and there, silently and unostentatiously, deposit a
    vote for such men as will do what they can to carry out those
    principles which we have so much at heart.


           *       *       *       *       *

    "Come, then, men of Pennsylvania, come and join us in this good
    work. Join us, to use such moral means as to correct public
    sentiment throughout the region where slavery exists, and to
    impress upon the people of the Free states a manly sense of
    their own rights. Join us, to place "just men" in all our public
    offices; men whose example a whole people may safely imitate.
    Join us to free our General Government from the ignominious
    reproach of slavery; to restore to our country those principles
    which our fathers so labored to establish; and to hand these
    principles down afresh to successive generations. It is the
    cause of truth, of humanity, and of God, to which we invite your
    aid. It is a cause of which you never need be ashamed. Living,
    you may be thankful, and dying, you may be thankful, for having
    labored in it. We have, as co-laborers with us, the noblest
    allies that man can wish. Within, we have the deepest
    convictions of conscience, the clearest deductions of reason;
    and, all over the world, wherever man is found, the first, the
    most ardent longings of the human soul. Without, we have the
    happiness of nearly three millions of the human race; the honor,
    as well as the best interests of our whole country; and the
    universal consent of all good men whose moral vision is not
    obscured by the mist of a low, misguided selfishness: while we
    seem to hear, as it were, the voices of the great and the good,
    the patriot and the philanthropist, of a past generation,
    calling to us and cheering us on. But, above all these, and
    beyond all these, we have with us the highest attributes of God,
    Justice and Mercy. With such allies, and in such a cause, who
    can doubt on which side the victory will ultimately rest.

    "May He who guides the destinies of nations, and without whose
    aid 'they labor in vain that build,' so incline your hearts to
    exert your whole influence to place in all our public offices
    just and good men, that our country may be preserved, her best
    interests advanced, and her institutions, free in reality as in
    name, handed down to the latest posterity."


Is not the love of God and man ingrained in every line of this writing?
Yet let us see how it was received by the most Christian (?) body in
this city.

I need hardly say that my father's mind had been largely impressed, from
earliest manhood, with the highest subject human thought can touch. His
library records his wide religious reading; but he could not see an
honest path towards the profession of any definite views till 1836. The
change wrought in him then, can best be gathered from his own simple
words (under date, 1842) written in a fly-leaf of "The Unitarian
Miscellany:" "Though I humbly trust that God made my trials in 1836 the
means of bringing me to true repentance, yet I have kept these books as
monuments of what I once was, and to remind me how grateful I should be
to Him for having snatched me as a 'brand from the burning,'" Such a
faith as this, born of the spiritual travail of years, what a life it
always has for the heart that forms it! It tells not of a persuasion,
but of a conviction; a disproof of skepticism through the gathered
forces of the soul; a struggle, through epochs of doubt and dismay, into
an attitude of positive vital faith. Its process is the only one that
gives real right to ultimate peace. In comparison with the method and
measure of such a conviction, what matters its specific form? Self-truth
is the point,--the fact for starting, the line for guiding; and as for
result, this lonely and solemn rally on the deepest within us, as it is
continuously unfolded, must lead to a glad and solemn union with the
Highest without us. Who can know unfailing inward energy except through
this new birth? It proved an ever-fresh spring of vigor to my father,
and because of it he was chosen, in 1839, president of "The Philadelphia
Bible Society." What changes were wrought in the policy of the Society,
what numerous plans were devised and executed for multiplying its
operations, how it was made a cordial alliance of all denominations,
will presently appear. This is now to be said: that, after filling his
office for five years, he found that his Anti-slavery testimony had
engendered in the managers a bitterness that would seize the address of
1844 for pretext, and make retaliation in his sacrifice. Thankful, for
the thousandth time, to be a sacrifice for the cause he loved, he sent
in his resignation in a letter full of Christian kindness and sorrow. A
short extract will show its tone:


    "One whose great heart wishes the best for humanity calls to us
    from the West: 'When your Society propose to put a Bible into
    every family, and yet omit all reference to the slaves; and
    when, giving an account of the destitution of the land, they
    make no mention of two and a half millions of people perishing
    in our midst without the Scriptures, can we help feeling that
    something is dreadfully wrong?' This, brethren, is a most solemn
    question. It is a question which I verily believe the American
    Bible Society, so far as they may have yielded, directly or
    indirectly, openly or silently, to a corrupt public sentiment on
    this subject, will have to answer at the bar of Him who has
    declared, that, 'If ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin,'
    and that 'Inasmuch as ye did it not to one of the least of
    these, ye did it not to me.' The spirit of Christianity is a
    spirit of universal love and philanthropy. She looks down with
    pity, and, if she could, she would look with scorn upon all the
    petty distinctions that exist among men. She casts her benignant
    eye abroad over the earth, and, wherever she sees man, she sees
    him _as man,_ as a being made in the image of God, whether an
    Indian, an African, or a Caucasian sun may shine upon him. She
    stoops from heaven to raise the fallen, to bind up the
    broken-hearted, to release the oppressed, to give liberty to the
    captive, and to break the fetters of those that are bound. She
    is marching onward with accelerated step, and, wherever she
    leaves the true impress of her heavenly influence, the moral
    wilderness is changed into the garden of the Lord. May it never
    be ours to do what may seem to be even the slightest obstacle to
    her universal sway.

    "But I have already written more than I intended. In bringing
    this communication to a close, allow me to express to you
    individually, and as a Board, my most sincere Christian
    attachment. Whatever course any members may have taken in
    relation to this matter, I must believe that they have acted
    from what has seemed to them a sense of duty. Far be it from me
    to impeach their motives. Time, the great test of truth, may
    show them their course in a very different light from that in
    which they now view it. I may, as a Christian, lament that their
    views of duty are not more in unison with my own. I may, as a
    man, feel heart-sickened at the diseased, the deplorably
    diseased state of the public mind, in relation to two and a half
    millions of my fellow-men in bondage. I may, as a citizen of a
    Free state, blush at the humiliating fact, that not only the
    tyranny, but the ubiquity of the slave power is everywhere so
    manifest; that it has insinuated itself into our free domain to
    such a degree that there seems to be as much mental Slavery in
    the Free states, as there is personal in the Slave states. I may
    feel all this, but I must not impeach the motives by which
    others have been governed."


There were twenty-one managers present at the reading of this letter,
and, at its conclusion, a noble friend of the slave moved that the
resignation be not accepted; the motion was lost by a vote of fourteen
against seven. It was then moved that it be accepted 'with regret:' this
was carried by the same vote! But 'with regret' was not an empty form
for easing this action to its recipient; how much it meant is seen in
the resolution that was added by unanimous acceptance:
"_Resolved_,--That this Board are mainly indebted to Professor C.D.
Cleveland for the prominent and influential position it has attained in
the regards of this Christian community, and that they bear an earnest
testimony to the sound judgment and unwearied zeal which have ever
characterized the discharge of his duties in his responsible office."
Let this tribute, coming from the bitterest personal opposition that
ever man encountered, measure the work that extorted it. Looking at it,
it will be difficult for the reader to believe that a sacrifice was made
of the man to whom it refers by a representative Christian body, and
merely to sate for a time the inhuman slave-greed; yet it is only one
fact out of many that might be adduced, and I have brought it forward
because it is, in my father's words, "a fair exponent of the position of
the Christian Church at that time upon the subject of Slavery."
Henceforward, he ceased not to rain blows, not only at his own (the
Presbyterian) denomination, but at all the organized expressions of
Christian purpose,--the Sunday-School Union, the Tract Society, etc.

While working thus by voice and pen, he was incessantly busy in personal
rescue of the slave. Especially was this the case when it became the
duty of every lover of his kind to defy the Fugitive Slave Law. How
eagerly he then sprang to aid the escape of those against whom a law of
the land impotently tried to bar the law of our common humanity! During
the years that followed the passage of this infamous bill, the position
he had attained here was of particular service. Recognized as one, who,
being a sort of standing sacrifice, might as well continue to battle in
the front; trusted implicitly even by his bitterest foes; with such a
broad philanthropy to back his appeals; pushing straight into every
breach where work was needed; blind to everything but his one light of
moral instinct;--he became an organ for the charities of those whose
softer natures longingly whispered the cry, but could not do the cut and
thrust work, of deliverance. Dr. Furness held the same position, and
others who, like him, refused to be enrolled in the 'Underground
Committee,' or in any definite Anti-Slavery organization. These men knew
that they were of greater service to the cause by being its body-guard,
by standing between it and the public, by making the appeals and taking
the blows, and by affording access, pecuniary and other, of each to
each.

Thus the times moved on--growing hotter, more difficult and dangerous,
but always working these two results: redoubling the labors of this
noble band, and shaking the city from lethargy into ferment. Men were
compelled to take sides, and but one result could follow, (the result
which always follows when human nature is stung and quickened to find
its highest instincts,) the Party of Right steadily moved to triumph.


       *       *       *       *       *


For a lesson to us in courage, it is worth while to ask, how these
Apostles of Freedom stood the terrible strain put upon them for so many
years. I can answer for the two of whom I write, and do not doubt that
the answer is true of the rest: This self-forgetfulness was made easy by
a love that filled and overfilled all their moral energies--the simple
love of man, as God's highest creation, and of his natural rights, as
God's best gift. Their work was not a mere result of will, not an
outcome of faculty, not an unsupported impulse of heart. It was
character living itself out, an utterance of its entire unity, something
drawn from the solemn depths of those life-convictions which all the
personal and impersonal powers of a man, aglow and welded, unite in
producing. Hence, their work was not apart from them, even so far as to
be called ahead of them; nor parallel with them; it was _one_ with them
by a necessary spiritual inclusion. Will and Duty ceased to be separate
powers; they were transfused through the whole breadth of their human
sympathies, adding to their warmth a fixity of purpose that bore them
without a falter, through thirty years of such bitter obloquy, as, in
these latter days, only the early Anti-Slavery disciples have had to
endure. These men never said, in reference to the Anti-slavery cause, _I
ought_ or _I will_, because they never needed to say them. The sun
shines without them, and life expands without them; and here were souls
as unconsciously beneficent as the one, as spontaneous in growth and
shaping as the other. Theirs was not a force that moved mechanically in
right lines, with limited objects before it. It did, indeed, sweep with
arrowy swiftness of assail on every point that offered; but when I
remember that it more often pleaded than stormed, that it penetrated
into every secret recess that mercy casually opened, and gently stirred
into fuller life those roots of human feeling that can be numbed by
apathy but not killed even by hate, I know that it was persuasive,
diffusive, inbreathing force, an influence vital in others because an
effluence vitalized from themselves.

So they stood, self-consecrated, enveloped by the love of God, permeated
by the love of man,--twin Perfect Loves that cast out all dream of fear.
And so they walked, calm as if a thousand stabs of personal insult never
brought them one of personal pain, passing through all as if nothing but
the serenest skies were above them. And, as I have said, right there is
one explanation of the anomaly; there _were_ the serenest skies above
them--heaven's love perpetually shining. Why should it not shine? all
the powers of the men were dedicated to rescuing the image of God on
this earth,--not man as he suffered physically, but the moral instinct
threatened with annihilation. It was sacred to them, this soul so sacred
to redeeming love, but too brutalized to find its way to it. Nor merely
the slave. Their love embraced, with yet more pitying fervor, the master
compelling his spiritual nature into death, and the northern apologist
letting his die; and this overmastering love of saving spiritual
integrity, was one power that made them and heart-ease hold unfailing
friends through the obloquy of those days; the other must be found in
the fact mentioned,--that neither resolve nor impulse was their spur,
but personal character moving from its depths.

From such a motive-power as this can come no parade of results. The
nature that works, proceeds from the necessary laws and forces of its
being, and is as simple and unconscious as any other natural law or
force. Hence there are no startling epochs to record in my father's
history, no supreme efforts; in filling the measure of daily opportunity
lay his chief work. I cannot measure it by our ten fingers' counting. I
can only show a life unfolding, and, by the essential laws of its
growth, embracing the noblest cause of its time. But if action means
vivifying public sentiment decaying under insidious poison; if it
includes the doing of this amid a storm of odium that would quickly have
shattered any soul irresolute for an instant; if it means incessant toil
quietly performed, vast sums collected and disbursed, time sacrificed,
strength spent; if it means holding up a great iniquity to loathing by a
powerful pen, and nailing moral cowardice where-ever it showed; if it be
risking livelihood by introducing the cause of the slave into every
literary work, and by mingling the school-culture of fifty future
mothers, year by year, with hatred of the sin; if it means one's life in
one's hand, friendships yielded, society defied, and position in it
cheerfully renounced; above all, if action means a wealth of goodness
overliving all scorns, compelling respect from a community rebuked,
fellowship from a Church charged with ungodliness, and acknowledgment of
unstained repute from a public eager to blacken with scandal; if to do
thus, and bear thus, and live thus, is action, then my father did act to
the full purpose of life in the struggle that freed the slave.

WILLIAM WHIPPER.


The locality of Columbia, where Mr. Whipper resided for many years, was,
as is well-known, a place of much note as a station on the Underground
Rail Road. The firm of Smith and Whipper (lumber merchants), was
likewise well-known throughout a wide range of country. Who, indeed,
amongst those familiar with the history of public matters connected with
the colored people of this country, has not heard of William Whipper?
For the last thirty years, as an able business man, it has been very
generally admitted, that he hardly had a superior.

Although an unassuming man, deeply engrossed with business--Anti-slavery
papers, conventions, and public movements having for their aim the
elevation of the colored man, have always commanded Mr. Whipper's
interest and patronage. In the more important conventions which have
been held amongst the colored people for the last thirty years, perhaps
no other colored man has been so often called on to draft resolutions
and prepare addresses, as the modest and earnest William Whipper. He has
worked effectively in a quiet way, although not as a public speaker. He
is self-made, and well read on the subject of the reforms of the day.
Having been highly successful in his business, he is now at the age of
seventy, in possession of a handsome fortune; the reward of long years
of assiduous labor. He is also cashier of the Freedman's Bank, in
Philadelphia. For the last few years he has resided at New Brunswick,
New Jersey, although his property and business confine him mainly to his
native State, Pennsylvania.

Owing to a late affliction in his family, compelling him to devote the
most of his time thereto, it has been impossible to obtain from him the
material for completing such a sketch as was desired. Prior to this
affliction, in answer to our request, he furnished some reminiscences of
his labors as conductor of the Underground Rail Road, and at the same
time, promised other facts relative to his life, but for the reason
assigned, they were not worked up, which is to be regretted.


    NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J., December 4, 1871.

    MR. WILLIAM STILL, DEAR SIR:--I sincerely regret the absence of
    statistics that would enable me to furnish you with many events,
    that would assist you in describing the operations of the
    Underground Rail Road. I never kept any record of those persons
    passing through my hands, nor did I ever anticipate that the
    history of that perilous period would ever be written. I can
    only refer to the part I took in it from memory, and if I could
    delineate the actual facts as they occurred they would savor so
    much of egotism that I should feel ashamed to make them public.
    I willingly refer to a few incidents which you may select and
    use as you may think proper.

    You are perfectly cognizant of the fact, that after the decision
    in York, Pa., of the celebrated Prigg case, Pennsylvania was
    regarded as free territory, which Canada afterwards proved to
    be, and that the Susquehanna river was the recognized northern
    boundary of the slave-holding empire. The borough of Columbia,
    situated on its eastern bank, in the county of Lancaster, was
    the great depot where the fugitives from Virginia and Maryland
    first landed. The long bridge connecting Wrightsville with
    Columbia, was the only safe outlet by which they could
    successfully escape their pursuers. When they had crossed this
    bridge they could look back over its broad silvery stream on its
    western shore, and say to the slave power: "Thus far shalt thou
    come, and no farther." Previous to that period, the line of
    fugitive travel was from Baltimore, by the way of Havre de Grace
    to Philadelphia; but the difficulty of a safe passage across the
    river, at that place caused the route to be changed to York,
    Pa., a distance of fifty-eight miles, the fare being forty
    dollars, and thence to Columbia, in the dead hour of the night.
    My house was at the end of the bridge, and as I kept the
    station, I was frequently called up in the night to take charge
    of the passengers.

    On their arrival they were generally hungry and penniless. I
    have received hundreds in this condition; fed and sheltered from
    one to seventeen at a time in a single night. At this point the
    road forked; some I sent west by boats, to Pittsburgh, and
    others to you in our cars to Philadelphia, and the incidents of
    their trials form a portion of the history you have compiled. In
    a period of three years from 1847 to 1850, I passed hundreds to
    the land of freedom, while others, induced by high wages, and
    the feeling that they were safe in Columbia, worked in the
    lumber and coal yards of that place. I always persuaded them to
    go to Canada, as I had no faith in their being able to elude the
    grasp of the slave-hunters. Indeed, the merchants had the
    confidence of their security and desired them to remain; several
    of my friends told me that I was injuring the trade of the place
    by persuading the laborers to leave. Indeed, many of the
    fugitives themselves looked upon me with jealousy, and expressed
    their indignation at my efforts to have them removed from peace
    and plenty to a land that was cold and barren, to starve to
    death.

    It was a period of great prosperity in our borough, and
    everything passed on favorably and successfully until the
    passage of the fugitive slave bill in 1850. At first the law was
    derided and condemned by our liberty-loving citizens, and the
    fugitives did not fear its operations because they asserted that
    they could protect themselves. This fatal dream was of short
    duration. A prominent man, by the name of Baker, was arrested
    and taken to Philadelphia, and given up by the commissioner, and
    afterwards purchased by our citizens; another, by the name of
    Smith, was shot dead in one of our lumber yards, because he
    refused to surrender, and his pursuer permitted to escape
    without arrest or trial. This produced not only a shock, but a
    crisis in the affairs of our little borough. It made the
    stoutest hearts quail before the unjust sovereignty of the law.
    The white citizens fearing the danger of a successful resistance
    to the majesty of the law, began to talk of the insecurity of
    these exiles. The fugitives themselves, whose faith and hope had
    been buoyed up by the promises held up to them of protection,
    began to be apprehensive of danger, and talked of leaving, while
    others, more bold, were ready to set the dangers that surrounded
    them at defiance, and if necessary, die in the defence of their
    freedom and the homes they had acquired.

    At this juncture private meetings were held by the colored
    people, and the discussions and resolves bore a peculiar
    resemblance in sentiment and expression to the patriotic
    outbursts of the American revolution.

    Some were in favor, if again attacked, of killing and slaying
    all within their reach; of setting their own houses on fire, and
    then going and burning the town. It was the old spirit which
    animated the Russians at Moscow, and the blacks of Hayti. At
    this point my self-interest mingled with my sense of humanity,
    and I felt that I occupied a more responsible position than I
    shall ever attain to again. I, therefore, determined to make the
    most of it. I exhorted them to peace and patience under their
    present difficulties, and for their own sakes as well as the
    innocent sufferers, besought them to leave as early as they
    could. If I had advocated a different course I could have caused
    the burning of the town. The result of our meeting produced a
    calm, that lasted only for a few days, when it was announced,
    one evening, that the claimants of a Methodist preacher, by the
    name of Dorsey, were in the borough, and that it was expected
    that they would attempt to take him that night.

    It was about nine o'clock in the evening when I went to his
    house, but was refused admittance, until those inside
    ascertained who I was. There were several men in the house all
    armed with deadly weapons, awaiting the approach of the
    intruders. Had they come the whole party would have been
    massacred. I advised Dorsey to leave, but he very pointedly
    refused, saying he had been taken up once before alive, but
    never would be again. The men told him to stand his ground, and
    they would stand by him and defend him, they had lived together,
    and would die together. I told them that they knew the strength
    of the pro-slavery feeling that surrounded them, and that they
    would be overpowered, and perhaps many lives lost, which might
    be saved by his changing his place of residence. He said, he had
    no money, and would rather die with his family, than be killed
    on the road. I said, how much money do you want to start with,
    and we will send you more if you need it. Here is one hundred
    dollars in gold. "That is not enough." "Will two hundred dollars
    do?" "Yes." I shall bring it to you to-morrow. I got the money
    the next morning, and when I came with it, he said, he could not
    leave unless his family was taken care of. I told him I would
    furnish his family with provisions for the next six months. Then
    he said he had two small houses, worth four hundred and
    seventy-five dollars. My reply was that I will sell them for
    you, and give the money to your family. He then gave me a power
    of attorney to do so, and attended to all his affairs. He left
    the next day, being the Sabbath, and has never returned since,
    although he has lived in the City of Boston ever since, except
    about six months in Canada.

    I wish to notice this case a little further, as the only one out
    of many to which I will refer. About the year 1831 or 1832, Mr.
    Joseph Purvis, a younger brother of Robert Purvis, about
    nineteen or twenty years of age, was visiting Mr. Stephen Smith,
    of Columbia, and while there the claimants of Dorsey came and
    secured him, and had proceeded about two miles with him on the
    way to Lancaster. Young Purvis heard of it, and his natural and
    instinctive love of freedom fired up his warm southern blood at
    the very recital. He was one of nature's noblemen. Fierce,
    fiery, and impulsive, he was as quick to decide as to perform.
    He demanded an immediate rescue. Though he was advised of the
    danger of such an attempt, his spirit and determination made him
    invincible. He proceeded to a place where some colored men were
    working. With a firm and determined look, and a herculean shout,
    he called out to them, "To arms, to arms! boys, we must rescue
    this man; I shall lead if you will follow." "We will," was the
    immediate response. And they went and overtook them, and
    dispersed his claimants. They brought Dorsey back in triumph to
    Columbia.

    He then gave Dorsey his pistol, with the injunction that he
    should use it and die in defence of his liberty rather than
    again be taken into bondage. He promised he would. I found him
    with this pistol on his table, the night I called on him, and I
    have every reason to believe that the promise gave to Mr. Purvis
    was one of the chief causes of his obstinacy. The lesson he had
    taught him had not only become incorporated in his nature, but
    had become a part of his religion.

    The history of this brave and noble effort of young Purvis, in
    rescuing a fellow-being from the jaws of Slavery has been handed
    down, in Columbia, to a generation that was born since that
    event has transpired. He always exhibited the same devotion and
    manly daring in the cause of the flying bondman that inspired
    his youthful ardor in behalf of freedom. The youngest of a
    family distinguished for their devotion to freedom, he was
    without superiors in the trying hour of battle. Like John Brown,
    he often discarded theories, but was eminently practical. He has
    passed to another sphere. Peace to his ashes! I honor his name
    as a hero, and friend of man. I loved him for the noble
    characteristics of his nature, and above all for his noble
    daring in defense of the right. As a friend I admired him, and
    owe his memory this tribute to departed worth.

    At this point a conscientious regard for truth dictates that I
    should state that my disposition to make a sacrifice for the
    removal of Dorsey and some other leading spirits was aided by my
    own desire for  _self-preservation._

    I knew that it had been asserted, far down in the slave region,
    that Smith & Whipper, the negro lumber merchants, were engaged
    in secreting fugitive slaves. And on two occasions attempts had
    been made to set fire to their yard for the purpose of punishing
    them for such illegal acts. And I felt that if a collision took
    place, we should not only be made to suffer the penalty, but the
    most valuable property in the village be destroyed, besides a
    prodigal waste of human life be the consequence. In such an
    event I felt that I should not only lose all I had ever earned,
    but peril the hopes and property of others, so that I would have
    freely given one thousand dollars to have been insured against
    the consequences of such a riot. I then borrowed fourteen
    hundred dollars on my own individual account, and assisted many
    others to go to a land where the virgin soil was not polluted by
    the foot-prints of a slave.

    The colored population of the Borough of Columbia, in 1850, was
    nine hundred and forty-three, about one-fifth the whole
    population, and in five years they were reduced to four hundred
    and eighty-seven by emigration to Canada.

    In the summer of 1853, I visited Canada for the purpose of
    ascertaining the actual condition of many of those I had
    assisted in reaching a land of freedom; and I was much gratified
    to find them contented, prosperous, and happy. I was induced by
    the prospects of the new emigrants to purchase lands on the
    Sydenham River, with the intention of making it my future home.

    In the spring of 1861, when I was preparing to leave, the war
    broke out, and with its progress I began to realize the prospect
    of a new civilization, and, therefore, concluded to remain and
    share the fortunes of my hitherto ill-fated country.

    I will say in conclusion that it would have been fortunate for
    us if Columbia, being a port of entry for flying fugitives, had
    been also the seat of great capitalists and freedom-loving
    inhabitants; but such was not the case. There was but little
    Anti-slavery sentiment among the whites, yet there were many
    strong and valiant friends among them who contributed freely;
    the colored population were too poor to render much aid, except
    in feeding and secreting strangers. I was doing a prosperous
    business at that time and felt it my duty to contribute
    liberally out of my earnings. Much as I loved Anti-slavery
    meetings I did not feel that I could afford to attend them, as
    my immediate duty was to the flying fugitive.

    Now, my friend, I have extended this letter far beyond the
    limits intended, not with the expectation that it will be
    published, but for your own private use to select any matter
    that you might desire to use in your history. I have to regret
    that I am compelled to refer so often to my own exertions.

    I know that I speak within bounds when I say that directly and
    indirectly from 1847 to 1860, I have contributed from my
    earnings one thousand dollars annually, and for the five years
    during the war a like amount to put down the rebellion.

    Now the slaves are emancipated, and we are all enfranchised,
    after struggling for existence, freedom and manhood--I feel
    thankful for having had the glorious privilege of laboring with
    others for the redemption of my race from oppression and
    thraldom; and I would prefer to-day to be penniless in the
    streets, rather than to have withheld a single hour's labor or a
    dollar from the sacred cause of liberty, justice, and humanity.

    I remain yours in the sacred cause of liberty and equality,

    WM. WHIPPER.




ISAAC T. HOPPER.


The distinctive characteristics of this individual were so admirably
portrayed in the newspapers and other periodicals published at the time
of his death, that we shall make free use of them without hesitation. He
was distinguished from his early life by his devotion to the relief of
the oppressed colored race. He was an active member of the old
Pennsylvania Abolition Society, and labored zealously with Dr. Benjamin
Rush, Dr. Rogers, Dr. Wistar, and other distinguished philanthropists of
the time. No man at that day, not even eminent judges and advocates, was
better acquainted with the intricacies of law questions connected with
slavery. His accurate legal knowledge, his natural acuteness, his ready
tact in avoiding dangerous corners and slipping through unseen
loop-holes, often gave him the victory in cases that seemed hopeless to
other minds. In many of these cases, physical courage was needed as much
as moral firmness; and he possessed these qualities in a very unusual
degree.

Being for many years an inspector of the public prisons, his practical
sagacity and benevolence were used with marked results. His enlarged
sympathies had always embraced the criminal and the imprisoned, as well
as the oppressed; and the last years of his life were especially devoted
to the improvement of prisons and prisoners. In this department of
benevolence he manifested the same zealous kindness and untiring
diligence that had so long been exerted for the colored people, for
whose welfare he labored to the end of his days.

He possessed a wonderful wisdom in furnishing relief to all who were in
difficulty and embarrassment. This caused a very extensive demand upon
his time and talents, which were rarely withheld when honestly sought,
and seldom applied in vain.

Mrs. Kirkland prepared, under the title of "The Helping Hand," a small
volume, for the benefit of "The Home" for discharged female convicts,
containing a brief description of the institution, and a detail of facts
illustrating the happy results of its operation. Its closing chapter is
appropriately devoted to the following well-deserved tribute to the
veteran philanthropist, to whose zeal and discretion that and so many
other similar institutions owe their existence, or to a large degree
their prosperity.


    "Not to inform the public what it knows very well already, nor
    to forestall the volume now preparing by Mrs. Child, a kindred
    spirit, but to gratify my own feelings, and to give grace and
    sanctity to this little book, I wish to say a few words of Mr.
    Hopper, the devoted friend of the prisoner as of the slave; one
    whose long life, and whose last thoughts, were given to the care
    and succor of human weakness, error, and suffering. To make even
    the most unpretending book for the benefit of 'The Home,'
    without bringing forward the name of Isaac T. Hopper, and
    recognizing the part he took in its affairs, from the earliest
    moment of its existence until the close of his life, would be an
    unpardonable omission. A few words must be said where a volume
    would scarcely suffice.

    "'The rich and the poor meet together, and the Lord is the
    Father of them all,' might stand for the motto of Mr. Hopper's
    life. That the most remote of these two classes stood on the
    same level of benevolent interest in his mind, his whole career
    made obvious; he was the last man to represent as naturally
    opposite those whom God has always, even to the end of the
    world, made mutually dependent. He told the simple truth to each
    with equal frankness; helped both with equal readiness. The
    palace owed him no more than the hovel suggested thoughts of
    superiority. Nothing human, however grand, or however degraded,
    was a stranger to him. In the light that came to him from
    heaven, all stood alike children of the Great Father; earthly
    distinction disappearing the moment the sinking soul or the
    suffering body was in question. No amount of depravity could
    extinguish his hope of reform; no recurrence of ingratitude
    could paralyze his efforts. Early and late, supported or
    unsupported, praised or ridiculed, he went forward in the great
    work of relief, looking neither to the right hand, nor to the
    left; and when the object was accomplished, he shrank back into
    modest obscurity, only to wait till a new necessity called for
    his reappearance. Who can number the poor, aching, conscious,
    despairing hearts that have felt new life come to them from his
    kind words, his benignant smile, his helping hand. If the record
    of his long life could be fully written, which it can never be,
    since every day and all day, in company, in the family circle,
    with children, with prisoners, with the insane, 'virtue went out
    of him' that no human observation could measure or describe,
    what touching interest would be added to the history of our poor
    and vicious population for more than half a century past; what
    new honor and blessing would surround the venerated name of our
    departed friend and leader!

    "But he desired nothing of this. Without claiming for him a
    position above humanity, which alone would account for a
    willingness to be wholly unrecognized as a friend of the
    afflicted, it is not too much to say that no man was ever less
    desirous of public praise or outward honor. He was even
    unwilling that any care should be taken to preserve the
    remembrance of his features, sweet and beautiful as they were,
    though he was brought reluctantly to yield to the anxious wish
    of his children and friends that the countenance on which every
    eye loved to dwell, should not be wholly lost when the grave
    should close above it. He loved to talk of interesting cases of
    reform and recovery, both because those things occupied his
    mind, and because every one loved to hear him; but the hearer
    who made these disclosures the occasion for unmeaning
    compliment, as if he fancied a craving vanity to have prompted
    them, soon found himself rebuked by the straightforward and
    plain-spoken patriarch. Precious indeed were those seasons of
    outpouring, when one interesting recital suggested another, till
    the listener seemed to see the whole mystery of prison-life and
    obscure wretchedness laid open before him with the distinctness
    of a picture. For, strange as it may seem, our friend had under
    his plain garb--unchanged in form since the days of Franklin, to
    go no further back--a fine dramatic talent, and could not relate
    the humblest incident without giving it a picturesque or
    dramatic turn, speaking now for one character, now for another,
    with a variety and discrimination very remarkable. This made his
    company greatly sought, and as his strongly social nature
    readily responded, his acquaintance was very large. To every one
    that knew him personally, I can appeal for the truth and
    moderation of these views of his character and manners.

    "A few biographical items will close what I venture to offer
    here.

    "Isaac T. Hopper was born December 3, 1771, in the township of
    Deptford, Gloucester county, New Jersey, but spent a large
    portion of his life in Philadelphia, where he served his
    apprenticeship to the humble calling of a tailor. But neither
    the necessity for constant occupation nor the temptations of
    youthful gaiety, prevented his commencing, even then, the
    devotion of a portion of his time, to the care of the poor and
    needy. He had scarcely reached man's estate when we find him an
    active member of a benevolent association, and his volume, of
    notes of cases, plans and efforts, date back to that early
    period. To that time also, we are to refer the beginning of his
    warm Anti-slavery sentiment, a feeling so prominent and
    effective throughout his life, and the source of some of his
    noblest efforts and sacrifices. For many years he served as
    inspector of prisons in Philadelphia, and thus, by long and
    constant practical observation, was accumulated that knowledge
    of the human heart in its darkest windings, that often
    astonished the objects of his care, when they thought they had
    been able cunningly to blind his eyes to their real character
    and intentions. After his removal to New York, and when the
    occasion for his personal labors in the cause of the slave had
    in some measure, ceased or slackened, he threw his whole heart
    into the Prison Association, whose aims and plans of action were
    entirely in accordance with his views, and indeed, in a great
    degree, based on his experience and advice. The intent of the
    Prison Association is threefold: first to protect and defend
    those who are arrested, and who, as is well known, often suffer
    greatly from want of honest and intelligent counsel; secondly,
    to attend to the treatment and instruction of convicts while in
    prison; and thirdly, on their discharge to render them such
    practical aid as shall enable the repentant to return to society
    by means of the pursuit of some honest calling. The latter
    branch occupied Mr. Hopper's time and attention, and he devoted
    himself to it with an affectionate and religious earnestness
    that ceased only with his life. No disposition was too perverse
    for his efforts at reform; no heart was so black that he did not
    at least try the balm of healing upon it; no relapses could tire
    out his patience, which, without weak waste of means still
    apostolically went on 'hoping all things,' while even a dying
    spark of good feeling remained.

    Up to February last did this venerable saint continue his
    abundant labors; when a severe cold, co-operating with the decay
    of nature, brought him his sentence of dismissal. He felt that
    it was on the way, and with the serious grace that marked
    everything he did, he began at once to gather his earthly robes
    about him and prepare for the great change which no one could
    dread less. It was hard for those who saw his ruddy cheek and
    sparkling eye, his soft brown hair, and sprightly movements to
    feel that the time of his departure was drawing nigh: but he
    knew and felt it, with more composure than his friends could
    summon. It might well be said of this our beloved patriarch,
    that his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated. To the
    last of his daily journeyings through the city, for which he
    generally used the rail road, he would never allow the drivers
    to stop for him to get on or off the car, feeling, as he used
    smilingly to observe, 'very jealous on that point.' Few ever
    passed him in the street without asking who he was; for not only
    did his primitive dress, his broad-brimmed hat, and his antique
    shoe buckles attract attention, but the beauty and benevolence
    of his face was sure to fix the eye of ordinary discernment. He
    was a living temperance lecture, and those who desire to
    preserve good looks could not ask a more infallible receipt,
    than that sweet temper and out-flowing benevolence which made
    his countenance please every eye. Gay and cheerful as a boy, he
    had ever some pleasant anecdote or amusing turn to relate, and
    in all perhaps not one without a moral bearing, not thrust
    forward, but left to be picked out by the hearer at his leisure.
    He seemed born to show how great strictness in essentials could
    exist without the least asceticism in trifles. Anything but a
    Simeon Stylites in his sainthood, he could go among 'publicans
    and sinners' without the least fear of being mistaken by them
    for one of themselves. An influence radiated from him that made
    itself felt in every company, though he would very likely be the
    most modest man present. More gentlemanly manners and address no
    court in Christendom need require; his resolute simplicity and
    candor, always under the guidance of a delicate taste, never for
    a moment degenerated into coarseness or disregard even of the
    prejudices of others. His life, even in these minute
    particulars, showed how the whole man is harmonized by the sense
    of being


        'Ever in the Great Taskmaster's eye.'


    "He died on the 7th of May, 1852, in his eighty-first year, and
    a public funeral in the Tabernacle brought together thousands
    desirous of showing respect to his memory."


Mrs. Child has written a full, and in many respects, an exceedingly
interesting biography of the subject of this memoir, towards the close
of which she says:


    "From the numerous notices in papers of all parties and sects, I
    will merely quote the following. 'The New York Observer' thus
    announces his death:


        "'The venerable Isaac T. Hopper, whose placid,
        benevolent face has so long irradiated almost every
        public meeting for doing good, and whose name,
        influence, and labors, have been devoted with an
        apostolic simplicity and constancy to humanity, died on
        Friday last, at an advanced age. He was a Quaker of that
        early sort illustrated by such philanthropists as
        Anthony Benezet, Thomas Clarkson, Mrs. Fry, and the
        like.

        "'He was a most self-denying, patient, loving friend of
        the poor, and the suffering of every kind; and his life
        was an unbroken history of beneficence. Thousands of
        hearts will feel a touch of grief at the news of his
        death; for few men have so large a wealth in the
        blessings of the poor, and the grateful remembrance of
        kindness and benevolence, as he.'


    "'The New York Times' contained the following:


        "'Most of our readers will call to mind, in connection
        with the name of Isaac T. Hopper, the compact, well-knit
        figure of a Quaker gentleman, apparently about sixty
        years of age, dressed in drab or brown clothes of the
        plainest cut, and bearing on his handsome, manly face
        the impress of that benevolence with which his whole
        heart was filled.

        "'He was twenty years older than he seemed. The fountain
        of benevolence within freshened his old age with its
        continuous flow. The step of the octogenarian was
        elastic as that of a boy, his form erect as a mountain
        pine.

        "'His whole physique was a splendid sample of nature's
        handiwork. We see him now with our mind's eye, but with
        the eye of flesh we shall see him no more. Void of
        intentional offence to God or man, his spirit has joined
        its happy kindred in a world where there is neither
        sorrow nor perplexity.'


    "I sent the following communication to 'The New York Tribune':


        "In this world of shadows, few things strengthen the
        soul like seeing the calm and cheerful exit of a truly
        good man; and this has been my privilege by the bedside
        of Isaac T. Hopper.

        "He was a man of remarkable endowments, both of head and
        heart. His clear discrimination, his unconquerable will,
        his total unconsciousness of fear, his extraordinary
        tact in circumventing plans he wished to frustrate,
        would have made him illustrious as the general of an
        army; and these qualities might have become faults, if
        they had not been balanced by an unusual degree of
        conscientiousness and benevolence. He battled
        courageously, not from ambition, but from an inborn love
        of truth. He circumvented as adroitly as the most
        practiced politician; but it was always to defeat the
        plans of those who oppressed God's poor; never to
        advance his own self-interest.

        "'Few men have been more strongly attached to any
        religious society than he was to the Society of Friends,
        which he joined in the days of its purity, impelled by
        his own religious convictions. But when the time came
        that he must either be faithless to duty in the cause of
        his enslaved brethren, or part company with the Society
        to which he was bound by the strong and sacred ties of
        early religious feeling, this sacrifice he also calmly
        laid on the altar of humanity.

        "'During nine years that I lived in his household, my
        respect and affection for him continually increased.
        Never have I seen a man who so completely fulfilled the
        Scripture injunction, to forgive an erring brother, 'not
        only seven times, but seventy times seven.' I have
        witnessed relapse after relapse into vice, under
        circumstances which seemed like the most heartless
        ingratitude to him; but he joyfully hailed the first
        symptom of repentance, and was always ready to grant a
        new probation.

        "'Farewell, thou brave and kind old Friend! The prayers
        of ransomed ones ascended to Heaven for thee, and a
        glorious company have welcomed thee to the Eternal
        City.'"





SAMUEL D. BURRIS,


Referred to by John Hunn, was also a brave conductor on the Underground
Rail Road leading down into Maryland (via Hunn's place). Mr. Burris was
a native of Delaware, but being a free man and possessing more than
usual intelligence, and withal an ardent love of liberty, he left
"slave-dom" and moved with his family to Philadelphia. Here his
abhorrence of Slavery was greatly increased, especially after becoming
acquainted with the Anti-slavery Office and the Abolition doctrine.
Under whose auspices or by what influence he was first induced to visit
the South with a view of aiding slaves to escape, the writer does not
recollect; nevertheless, from personal knowledge, prior to 1851, he well
knew that Burris was an accredited agent on the road above alluded to,
and that he had been considered a safe, wise, and useful man in his day
and calling. Probably the simple conviction that he would not otherwise
be doing as he would be done by actuated him in going down South
occasionally to assist some of his suffering friends to get the yokes
off their necks, and with him escape to freedom. A number were thus
aided by Burris. But finally he found himself within the fatal snare;
the slave-holders caught him at last, and Burris was made a prisoner in
Dover jail. His wife and children were thereby left without their
protector and head. The friends of the slave in Philadelphia and
elsewhere deeply sympathized with him in this dreadful hour. Being able
to use the pen, although he could not write without having his letters
inspected, he kept up a constant correspondence with his friends both in
Delaware and Philadelphia. John Hunn and Thomas Garrett were as faithful
to him as brothers. After lying in prison for many months, his trial
came on and Slavery gained the victory. The court decided that he must
be sold in or out of the State to serve for seven years. No change,
pardon or relief, could be expected from the spirit and power that held
sway over Delaware at that time.

The case was one of great interest to Mr. McKim, as indeed to the entire
Executive Committee of the Pennsylvania Anti-slavery Society, who felt
constrained to do all they could to save the poor man from his
threatened fate, although they had not advised or encouraged him in the
act for which he was condemned and about to suffer. In viewing his
condition, but a faint ray of hope was entertained from one single
direction. It was this: to raise money privately and have a man at the
auction on the day of sale to purchase him.

John Hunn and Thomas Garrett were too well known as Abolitionists to
undertake this mission. A friend indeed, was desirable, but none other
would do than such an one as would not be suspected. Mr. McKim thought
that a man who might be taken for a negro trader would be the right kind
of a man to send on this errand. Garrett and Hunn being consulted
heartily acquiesced in this plan, and after much reflection and inquiry,
Isaac S. Flint, an uncompromising abolitionist, living in Wilmington,
Delaware, was elected to buy Burris at the sale, providing that he was
not run up to a figure exceeding the amount in hand.

Flint's abhorrence of Slavery combined with his fearlessness, cool
bearing, and perfect knowledge from what he had read of the usages of
traders at slave sales, without question admirably fitted him to play
the part of a trader for the time being.

When the hour arrived, the doomed man was placed on the auction-block.
Two traders from Baltimore were known to be present; how many others the
friends of Burris knew not. The usual opportunity was given to traders
and speculators to thoroughly examine the property on the block, and
most skillfully was Burris examined from the soles of his feet to the
crown of his head; legs, arms and body, being handled as horse-jockies
treat horses. Flint watched the ways of the traders and followed for
effect their example. The auctioneer began and soon had a bid of five
hundred dollars. A Baltimore trader was now in the lead, when Flint, if
we mistake not, bought off the trader for one hundred dollars. The bids
were thus suddenly checked, and Burris was knocked down to Isaac S.
Flint (a strange trader). Of course he had left his abolition name at
home and had adopted one suited to the occasion. When the crier's hammer
indicated the last bid, although Burris had borne up heroically
throughout the trying ordeal, he was not by any means aware of the fact
that he had fallen into the hands of friends, but, on the contrary,
evidently labored under the impression that his freedom was gone. But a
few moments were allowed to pass ere Flint had the bill of sale for his
property, and the joyful news was whispered in the ear of Burris that
all was right; that he had been bought with abolition gold to save him
from going south. Once more Burris found himself in Philadelphia with
his wife and children and friends, a stronger opponent than ever of
Slavery. Having thus escaped by the skin of his teeth, he never again
ventured South.

After remaining a year or two in Philadelphia, about the year 1852 he
went to California to seek more lucrative employment than he had
hitherto found. Becoming somewhat satisfactorily situated he sent for
his family, who joined him. In the meanwhile, his interest in the cause
of freedom did not falter; he always kept posted on the subject of the
Underground Rail Road and Anti-slavery questions; and after the war,
when appeals were made on behalf of contrabands who flocked into
Washington daily in a state of utter destitution, Burris was among the
first to present the matter to the colored churches of San Francisco,
with a view of raising means to aid in this good work, and as the
result, a handsome collection was taken up and forwarded to the proper
committee in Washington.

About three years ago, Samuel D. Burris died, in the city of San
Francisco, at about the age of sixty years. To the slave he had been a
true friend, and had labored faithfully for the improvement of his own
mind as well as the general elevation of his race.



MARIANN, GRACE ANNA, AND ELIZABETH R. LEWIS.


Near Kimberton, in Chester county, Pa., was the birth-place, and, till
within a few years, the home of three sisters, Mariann, Grace Anna and
Elizabeth R. Lewis, who were among the most faithful, devoted, and
quietly efficient workers in the Anti-slavery cause, including that
department of it which is the subject of this volume.

Birth-right members of the Society of Friends, they were born into more
than the traditional Anti-slavery faith and feeling of that Society. A
deep abhorrence of slavery, and an earnest will to put that feeling into
act, as opportunity should serve, were in the very life-blood which they
drew from father and mother both.

Left fatherless at an early age, they were taught by their mother to
remember that their father, on his visits to their maternal grandfather,
living then in Maryland, was wont, as he expressed it, to feel the black
shadow of slavery over his spirit, from the time he entered, till he
left, the State; and that, on his death-bed, he had regretted having let
ill-health prevent his meeting with, and joining one of the Anti-slavery
Societies of that day. Of the mother's share in the transmission of
their hereditary feeling, it is enough, to all acquainted with the
history of Anti-slavery work in Pennsylvania, to say that she was
sister, not by blood alone, but in heart and soul, to that early,
active, untiring abolitionist, Dr. Bartholomew Fussell.

It is easy to see that the children of such parents, growing up under
the influence of such a mother, needed no conversion, no sacrifices of
prejudice or hostile opinions, to make them Anti-slavery; but were
ready, simply as a matter of course, to work for the good cause whenever
any way appeared in which their work could serve it. What was called
"modern abolitionism," as distinguished from the less aggressive form of
opposition to slavery, which preceded the movement pioneered by
Garrison, they at once accepted, as soon as it was set before them,
through the agents of the American Anti-Slavery Society, in the campaign
in Pennsylvania, begun in 1836. Regarding it but as the next step
forward in the way they had already entered, they instinctively fell
into line with the new movement, assisted in forming a society auxiliary
to it, in their own neighborhood, and were constant to the end in
working for its advancement.


EARNEST IN THE CAUSE.


[Illustration: GRACE ANNE LEWIS]

[Illustration: MRS. FRANCIS E. W. HARPER]

[Illustration: JOHN NEEDLES.]

Auxiliary to the influences already mentioned, was a very early
recollection of seeing a colored man, Henry, bound with ropes and
carried off to slavery. Grace Anna, not more than four or five years old
at the time, declared that the man's face of agony is before her now;
nor is it likely that her sisters were impressed less deeply. Of natures
keenly sensitive, they hated slavery, from that hour, as only children
of such natures can; and--as yet too young and immature for that charity
to have been developed in them, which can see a brother even in the
evil-doer, and pity while condemning him,--they even more intensely
hated, while they feared, the actors in the outrage, and despised the
girl who had betrayed the victim. Ever after, any one of them could be
trusted to be faithful to the hunted fugitive, though an army of
kidnappers might surround her.

Another of their early recollections was of a white handkerchief which
was to be waved from a back window, as a signal of danger, to a colored
man at work in a wood near by. And, all the while, the feelings aroused
by such events were kept alive by little Anti-slavery poems, which they
were wont to learn by heart and recite in the evenings. Grace Anna, on
her first visit to Philadelphia, when nine years old, bought a copy of
one of these, entitled "Zambo's Story," pleased to recognize in it a
favorite of her still earlier childhood.

By means like these they were unconsciously preparing themselves for the
predestined tasks of their after-life; and if there were danger that
such a strain upon their sympathies, as they often underwent, might
prove unhealthful, it was fully counteracted by ball-playing, and all
kinds of active out-door amusements of childhood, so that it was never
known to result in harm.

As time passed on, their home, always open to fugitives, became an
important centre of Underground Rail Road operations for the region
extending from Wilmington, Del., into Adams county, Pa.; and they, grown
to womanhood, had glided into the management of its very considerable
business. They received passengers from Thomas Garrett, and sometimes
others, perhaps, of Wilmington, when it was thought unsafe to send them
thence directly through Philadelphia; from Wm. and Phebe Wright, in
Adams county, and from friends, more than we have room to name, in York,
Columbia, and the southern parts of Lancaster and Chester counties; the
several lines, from Adams county to Wilmington, converging upon the
house of John Vickers, of Lionville, whose wagon, laden apparently with
innocent-looking earthen ware from his pottery, sometimes conveyed,
unseen beneath the visible load, a precious burden of Southern chattels,
on their way to manhood.

[At a later period, the trains from Adams county generally took another
course, going to Harrisburg, and on to Canada, by way of the Susquehanna
Valley; though still, when pursuit that way was apprehended, the former
course was taken.]

These passengers, the Lewises forwarded in diverse ways; usually, in the
earlier times, by wagon or carriage, to Richard Moore, of Quakertown, in
Bucks county, about thirty miles distant; but later, when abolitionists
were more numerous, and easier stages could be safely made, either
directly to the writer, or to one or other of ten or twelve stations
which had become established at places less remote, in the counties of
Chester and Montgomery. During portions of the time, their married
sister Rebecca, and her husband, Edwin Fussell, and their uncle, Dr. B.
Fussell, and, after him, his brother William, lived on farms adjoining
theirs, and were their active helpers in this work.

The receiving and passing on of fugitives, was not all they had to do.
Often it was necessary to fit out whole families with clothing suitable
for the journey. In cases of emergency they would sometimes gather a
sewing-circle from such neighboring families as could be trusted; and,
with its help, accomplish rapidly the needed work. One instance is
remembered, of a woman, with her little boy, whom they put into girls'
attire; and, changing also the woman's dress, sent both, by cars, to
Canada, accompanied by a friend. In this kind of work, too, they had
generous aid from friends at neighboring stations. From Lawrenceville
and Limerick, and Pottstown and Pughtown, came contributions of
clothing; at one time a supply which filled compactly three three-bushel
bags, and of which a small remainder, still on hand when slavery was
abolished, was sent South to the freedmen.

The prudence, skill, and watchful care with which the business was
conducted, are well attested by the fact that, so far as can be
remembered, during all the many years of their connection with the
Underground Rail Road, not a plan miscarried, and not a slave that
reached their station was retaken; although among their neighbors there
were bitter adversaries of the Anti-slavery cause, eager to find
occasion for hostile acts against any abolitionist; and, at times,
especially vindictive against the noble sisters, because of their
effective co-operation with other friends of Temperance, in preventing
the licensing of a liquor-selling tavern in the neighborhood. On one
occasion, when, within a week, they had passed on to freedom no less
than forty fugitives, eleven of whom had been in the house at once, they
were amused at hearing a remark by some of their pro-slavery neighbors,
to the effect that "there used to be a pretty brisk trade of running off
niggers, but there was not much of it done now."

Though parties of four, five or six sometimes arrived in open day, they
seldom sent any away till about nightfall or later, and, whenever the
danger was greater than usual, the coming was also at night. The
fugitives, in attempting to capture whom, Gorsuch was killed, near
Christiana, were brought to them at midnight, by Dr. Fussell; and in
this case such caution was observed, that not even the hired girl knew
of the presence of persons not of the family.

For one reason or another,--perhaps to let a hot pursuit go by; perhaps
to allow opportunity for recovering from fatigue and recruiting
exhausted strength, or for earning means to pursue the journey by the
common railroads,--it was often thought advisable that passengers should
remain with them for a considerable period; and numbers of these were,
at different times, employed as laborers in some capacity. Grace Anna
testifies that some of the best assistants they ever had in the house or
on the farm, were these escaped slaves; that in general they were
thrifty and economical, one man, for instance, who spent several years
with them, having accumulated five hundred dollars before he went on to
Canada; and another, enough to furnish an old coat with a full set of
buttons, each of which was a golden half-eagle, covered with cloth, and
firmly sewed on, besides an ample supply of good clothing for himself
and his wife; and that, almost without exception, they were honest and
loyal to their benefactors, and only too happy to find opportunities of
showing their gratitude. One man sent back to the sisters a letter of
thanks, through a gentleman in England, whither he had gone. And once,
when Grace Anna was passing an elegant mansion in Philadelphia, a
colored woman rushed out upon her with such an impetuous demonstration
of affection, joy, and thankfulness--all thought of fitness of time and
place swept away by the swell of strong emotion--as might well have
amused, or slightly astonished, the passers in the street, who knew not
that in her arms the woman's child had died. But it is no marvel that to
her the memory of that poor runaway slave-woman's true affection is more
than could have been the warmest welcome from her educated and refined
mistress.

One case, of which the sisters for a time had charge, seems worthy of a
somewhat more extended mention. In the fall of 1855 a slave named
Johnson, who, in fleeing from bondage, had come as far as Wilmington,
thinking he saw his master on the train by which he was journeying
northward, sprang from the car and hurt his foot severely. The Kennett
abolitionists having taken him in hand, and fearing that suspicious eyes
were on him in their region, felt it necessary to send him onward
without waiting for his wound to heal. He was therefore taken to the
Lewises, suffering very much in his removal, and arriving in a condition
which required the most assiduous care. For more than four months he
remained with them, patient and gentle in his helplessness and
suffering, and very thankful for the ministrations of kindness he
received. He was nursed as tenderly as if his own sisters had attended
him, instead of strangers, and was so carefully concealed that the
nearest neighbors knew not of his being with them. Their cousin, Morris
Fussell, who lived near, being a physician, they had not to depend for
even medical advice upon the outside world.

As the sufferer's wound, in natural course, became offensive, the care
of it could not but have been disagreeable as well as toilsome; and the
feeble health of one of the sisters at that time must have made heavier
the burden to be borne. But it was borne with a cheerful constancy. In a
letter which Grace Anna wrote after she had attended for some time in
person to the patient, with the care and sympathy which his condition
demanded, and begun to feel her strength unequal to the task, in
addition to her household duties, she asked a friend in Philadelphia to
procure for her a trusty colored woman fit to be a helper in the work,
offering higher wages than were common in that region for the services
required, and adding that, indeed, they could not stand upon the amount
of pay, but must have help, if it could be obtained, though not in a
condition to bear undue expenditure. But, she said, the man "is unable
to be removed; and if he were not, I know of no place where the charge
would not be equally severe." So, in perfect keeping with her character,
she just quietly regarded it as a matter of course that it should still
continue where it was. And there it did continue until spring, when the
man, now able to bear removal, was conveyed to the writer, and, after a
time, went thence to Boston. There his foot, pronounced incurable, was
amputated, and the abolitionists supplied him with a wooden limb. He
then returned and spent another winter with the Lewises, assisting in
the household work, and rendering services invaluable at a time when it
was almost impossible to obtain female help. The next spring, hoping
vainly to recover in a warmer climate from the disease induced by the
drain his wounded foot had made upon his system, he went to Hayti, and
there died; happy, we may well believe, to have escaped from slavery,
though only to have won scarely two years of freedom as an invalid and a
cripple.

The sisters were so thoroughly united in their work, as well as in all
the experiences of life, that this brief sketch has not attempted what
indeed it could not have achieved--a separation of their spheres of
beneficent activity. Yet they had each her individual traits and
adaptations to their common task; "diversities of gifts, but the same
spirit." Elizabeth, although for many years shut out by feeble health
from any part requiring much bodily exertion, was ever a wise
counsellor, as well as ready with such help as her state of health would
warrant. Though weak in body, in spirit she was strong and calm and
self-reliant, with a clear, discriminating intellect, a keen sense of
right, and a certain solidity and balanced symmetry of the spiritual
nature which made her an appreciable power wherever she was known. Of
Mariann, Grace Anna says, that if a flash of inspiration was required,
it usually came from her. Taught by her love for others, and by a
sensitiveness almost preternaturally quick, "she always knew exactly the
right thing to do," and put all the poetry of a nature exquisitely fine
into her efforts to diffuse around her purity and peace and happiness.
Her constant, utterly unselfish endeavors to this end contributed in
ample measure to the blessedness of a delightful home, rich in the
virtues, charities and graces which make home blessed. Veiled by her
modest and retiring disposition, to few beyond the circle of her home
were known the beauty and beneficence of her noiseless life; but those
who did look in upon it testified her worth in terms so strong as showed
how deeply it impressed them. "Just the best woman I ever knew," said a
young man for whom she had long cared like a mother. "I cannot
remember," said another, "ever hearing from her one ungentle word;" and
it may be safely doubted whether she was ever heard to utter such. And
one who "knew her every mood" cannot recall an instance of selfishness
in her, even when a child. "The most womanly woman I ever knew,"
declared a friend long closely intimate with her, "and such as would
have been adored, if found by any man worthy of her."

The ideal element in her was chastened by sound sense and blended with a
quick sagacity; but her shrinking sensitiveness, too keen to be quite
healthy, and an extreme of self-forgetfulness, amounting possibly to a
defect in one sojourning amid this world's diverse dispositions and
experiences, rendered her, on the whole, less balanced and complete than
her younger sisters, and not well fitted for rough encounter with life's
trials. So it became Grace Anna's province, especially after their
mother's death, to stand a shelter between her and whatever would
unpleasantly affect her by its contact; to be in some sort as a brother
to her, seeing there was no brother in the house. But from this it must
not be inferred that Grace Anna is less gifted with the distinctive
qualities of her sex. For the native fineness of her spiritual texture,
her gentle dignity and feminine delicacy and grace, mark her as "every
inch" a true and noble woman. In her combine in happy union the calm
strength of soul and self-reliance of her younger, with the poetic
ideality and a just degree of the quick sensibility of her elder sister,
with better health than either, making her foremost of the three in that
executive efficiency which did so much to give their plans the uniform
success already mentioned. Kindness and warm affection, clearness of
moral vision, and purity of heart, with a lively relish for quiet
intellectual pleasures, for society and books adapted to refine, improve
and elevate, were among the characteristics common to them all.

Mariann and Elizabeth, having lived to see the triumph of the Right, in
the Presidential Proclamation of Freedom to the slaves, have gone from
their earthly labors to their heavenly rest; which, we may well believe,
is that whereof the poet speaks:


      "Rest in harmonious action like the stars,
      Doing the deeds which make heaven musical,
      The earth a heaven, and brothers of us all."



Grace Anna still continues here, working for human welfare in such
fields as still demand the laborer's toil; and finding mental profit and
delight in the pursuit of natural science.



CUNNINGHAM'S RACHE.


BY MISS GRACE A. LEWIS.

Among the many fugitives whose stories were full of interest, was that
of a woman named Rachel. She was tall, muscular, slight, with an
extremely sensitive nervous organization, a brain of large size, and an
expression of remarkable sagacity and quickness. She was living in West
Chester, Chester county, Pa., when attempts were made to retake her to
Slavery. With wonderful swiftness and adroitness she eluded pursuit, and
was soon hurried away. Speedily reaching our house, she hid herself away
during the day, and in the evening, as a place of greater safety, she
was transferred to the house of our uncle, Dr. Fussell, then residing on
an adjoining farm. As was his wont, this kind-hearted man soon entered
into a conversation with her, and in a few minutes discovered that she
had once been a pupil of his during his residence in Maryland many years
before.

At the moment of recognition she sprang up, overwhelming him with her
manifestations of delight, crying: "You Dr. Fussell? You Dr. Fussell?
Don't you remember me? I'm Rache--Cunningham's Rache, down at Bush River
Neck." Then receding to view him better, "Lord bless de child! how he is
grown!"

Her tongue once loosened, she poured forth her whole history, expressing
in every lineament her concentrated abhorrence of her libertine master,
"Mort Cunningham." Over that story, it is needful to pass lightly,
simply saying, she endured all outraged nature could endure and survive.
For the sake of humanity we may trust there were few such fiends even
among southern masters as this monster in human shape. Cunningham
finally sold her to go further South, with a master whose name cannot
now be recalled. This man was in ill health, and after a time he and his
wife started northward, bringing Rache with them. On the voyage the
master grew worse, and one night when he was about to die, a fearful
storm arose, which Rache devoutly believed was sent from Heaven. In
describing this scene, she impersonated her surroundings with wonderful
vividness and marvellous power. At one moment she was the howling wind;
at another the tumultuous sea--then the lurching ship--the bellowing cow
frightened by the storm--the devil, who came to carry away her master's
soul, and finally the weak, dying man, as he passed to eternity.

They proceeded on their voyage and landed at their place of destination.
Rache sees the cow snuffing the land breeze and darting off through the
crowd. The captain of the vessel points to the cow and motions her to
follow its example. She needs nothing more. Again she is acting--she is
now the cow; but human caution, shrewdness, purpose, are lent to animal
instinct. She looks around her with wary eye--scents the air--a flash,
and she is hidden from the crowd which you see around her--she is free!
Making her way northward, she finally arrived at the house of Emmer
Kimber, Kimberton, Chester county, Pa., and proving a remarkably capable
woman, she remained a considerable time in his family, as a cook. She
finally married, and settled in West Chester, where the pair prospered
and were soon surrounded by the comforts of a neat home. After several
years of peaceful life there, she was one day alarmed, not by the heirs
of her dead master, but by the loathed "Mort Cunningham," who, without
the shadow of legal right, had come to carry her back to Slavery. Fear
lent her wings. She darted into a hatter's shop and out through the back
buildings, springing over a dye kettle in her way, and cleared a board
fence at a bound. On her way to a place of safety she looked back to
see, with keen enjoyment, "Mort Cunningham" falling backward from the
fence she had leaped. Secure in a garret, she looked down into the
streets below, to see his vacant, dazed look as he sought, unable to
find her. Her rendering of the expression of his face at this time, was
irresistibly ludicrous, as was that of his whole bearing while searching
for her. "Mort Cunningham" did not get her, but whether or not she ever
returned to the enjoyment of her happy home, in West Chester, we never
knew, as this sudden flight was the last we ever heard of her. She was
one of the most wide-awake of human beings, and the world certainly lost
in the uneducated slave, an actor of great dramatic power.



FRANCES ELLEN WATKINS HARPER.


The narratives and labors of eminent colored men such as Banneker,
Douglass, Brown, Garnet, and others, have been written and sketched very
fully for the public, and doubtless with advantage to the cause of
freedom. But there is not to be found in any written work portraying the
Anti-Slavery struggle, (except in the form of narratives,) as we are
aware of, a sketch of the labors of any eminent colored woman. We feel,
therefore, not only glad of the opportunity to present a sketch not
merely of the leading colored poet in the United States, but also of one
of the most liberal contributors, as well as one of the ablest advocates
of the Underground Rail Road and of the slave.

No extravagant praise of any kind,--only simple facts are needed to
portray the noble deeds of this faithful worker.

The want of space forbids more than a brief reference to her early life.

Frances Ellen Watkins Harper (Watkins being her maiden name) was born in
the City of Baltimore in 1825, not of slave parentage, but subjected of
course to the oppressive influence which bond and free alike endured
under slave laws. Since reaching her majority, in looking back, the
following sentences from her own pen express the loneliness of her
childhood days. "Have I yearned for a mother's love? The grave was my
robber. Before three years had scattered their blight around my path,
death had won my mother from me. Would the strong arm of a brother have
been welcome? I was my mother's only child." Thus she fell into the
hands of an aunt, who watched over her during these early helpless
years. Rev. William Watkins, an uncle, taught a school in Baltimore for
free colored children, to which she was sent until she was about
thirteen years of age. After this period, she was put out to work to
earn her own living. She had many trials to endure which she would fain
forget; but in the midst of them all she had an ardent thirst for
knowledge and a remarkable talent for composition, as she evinced at the
age of fourteen in an article which attracted the attention of the lady
in whose family she was employed, and others. In this situation she was
taught sewing, took care of the children, &c.; and at the same time,
through the kindness of her employer, her greed for books was satisfied
so far as was possible from occasional half-hours of leisure. She was
noted for her industry, rarely trifling away time as most girls are wont
to do in similar circumstances. Scarcely had she reached her majority
ere she had written a number of prose and poetic pieces which were
deemed of sufficient merit to publish in a small volume called "Forest
Leaves." Some of her productions found their way into newspapers and
attracted attention. The ability exhibited in some of her productions
was so remarkable that some doubted and others denied their originality.
Of this character we here copy an extract from one of her early prose
productions:



CHRISTIANITY.



    "Christianity is a system claiming God for its author, and the
    welfare of man for its object. It is a system so uniform,
    exalted and pure, that the loftiest intellects have acknowledged
    its influence, and acquiesced in the justness of its claims.
    Genius has bent from his erratic course to gather fire from her
    altars, and pathos from the agony of Gethsemane and the
    sufferings of Calvary. Philosophy and science have paused amid
    their speculative researches and wondrous revelations to gain
    wisdom from her teachings and knowledge from her precepts.
    Poetry has culled her fairest flowers and wreathed her softest
    to bind her Author's 'bleeding brow.' Music has strung her
    sweetest lyres and breathed her noblest strains to celebrate his
    fame; whilst Learning has bent from her lofty heights to bow at
    the lowly cross. The constant friend of man, she has stood by
    him in his hour of greatest need. She has cheered the prisoner
    in his cell, and strengthened the martyr at the stake. She has
    nerved the frail and shrinking heart of woman for high and holy
    deeds. The worn and weary have rested their fainting heads upon
    her bosom, and gathered strength from her words and courage from
    her counsels. She has been the staff of decrepit age and the joy
    of manhood in its strength. She has bent over the form of lovely
    childhood, and suffered it to have a place in the Redeemer's
    arms. She has stood by the bed of the dying, and unveiled the
    glories of eternal life, gilding the darkness of the tomb with
    the glory of the resurrection."


Her mind being of a strictly religious caste, the effusions from her pen
all savor of a highly moral and elevating tone.

About the year 1851 she left Baltimore to seek a home in a Free State,
and for a short time resided in Ohio, where she was engaged in teaching.
Contrary to her expectations, her adopted home and calling not proving
satisfactory, she left that State and came to Pennsylvania as a last
resort, and again engaged in teaching at Little York. Here she not only
had to encounter the trouble of dealing with unruly children, she was
sorely oppressed with the thought of the condition of her people in
Maryland. Not unfrequently she gave utterance to such expressions as the
following: "Not that we have not a right to breathe the air as freely as
anybody else here (in Baltimore), but we are treated worse than aliens
among a people whose language we speak, whose religion we profess, and
whose blood flows and mingles in our veins.... Homeless in the land of
our birth and worse off than strangers in the home of our nativity."
During her stay in York she had frequent opportunities of seeing
passengers on the Underground Rail Road. In one of her letters she thus
alluded to a traveler: "I saw a passenger _per_ the Underground Rail
Road yesterday; did he arrive safely? Notwithstanding that abomination
of the nineteenth century--the Fugitive Slave Law--men still determine
to be free. Notwithstanding all the darkness in which they keep the
slaves, it seems that somehow light is dawning upon their minds....
These poor fugitives are a property that can walk. Just to think that
from the rainbow-crowned Niagara to the swollen waters of the Mexican
Gulf, from the restless murmur of the Atlantic to the ceaseless roar of
the Pacific, the poor, half-starved, flying fugitive has no
resting-place for the sole of his foot!"

Whilst hesitating whether or not it would be best to continue teaching,
she wrote to a friend for advice as follows: "What would you do if you
were in my place? Would you give up and go back and work at your trade
(dress-making)? There are no people that need all the benefits resulting
from a well-directed education more than we do. The condition of our
people, the wants of our children, and the welfare of our race demand
the aid of every helping hand, the God-speed of every Christian heart.
It is a work of time, a labor of patience, to become an effective school
teacher; and it should be a work of love in which they who engage should
not abate heart or hope until it is done. And after all, it is one of
woman's most sacred rights to have the privilege of forming the symmetry
and rightly adjusting the mental balance of an immortal mind." "I have
written a lecture on education, and I am also writing a small book."

Thus, whilst filling her vocation as a teacher in Little York, was she
deeply engrossed in thought as to how she could best promote the welfare
of her race. But as she was devoted to the work in hand, she soon found
that fifty-three untrained little urchins overtaxed her naturally
delicate physical powers; it also happened just about this time that she
was further moved to enter the Anti-Slavery field as a lecturer
substantially by the following circumstance: About the year 1853,
Maryland, her native State, had enacted a law forbidding free people of
color from the North from coming into the State on pain of being
imprisoned and sold into slavery. A free man, who had unwittingly
violated this infamous statute, had recently been sold to Georgia, and
had escaped thence by secreting himself behind the wheel-house of a boat
bound northward; but before he reached the desired haven, he was
discovered and remanded to slavery. It was reported that he died soon
after from the effects of exposure and suffering. In a letter to a
friend referring to this outrage, Mrs. Harper thus wrote: "Upon that
grave I pledged myself to the Anti-Slavery cause."

Having thus decided, she wrote in a subsequent letter, "It may be that
God himself has written upon both my heart and brain a commission to use
time, talent and energy in the cause of freedom." In this abiding faith
she came to Philadelphia, hoping that the way would open for usefulness,
and to publish her little book (above referred to). She visited the
Anti-Slavery Office and read Anti-Slavery documents with great avidity;
in the mean time making her home at the station of the Underground Rail
Road, where she frequently saw passengers and heard their melting tales
of suffering and wrong, which intensely increased her sympathy in their
behalf. Although anxious to enter the Anti-Slavery field as a worker,
her modesty prevented her from pressing her claims; consequently as she
was but little known, being a young and homeless maiden (an exile by
law), no especial encouragement was tendered her by Anti-Slavery friends
in Philadelphia.

During her stay in Philadelphia she published some verses entitled,
"Eliza Harris crossing the River on the Ice." It was deemed best to
delay the issuing of the book.

After spending some weeks in Philadelphia, she concluded to visit
Boston. Here she was treated with the kindness characteristic of the
friends in the Anti-Slavery Office whom she visited, but only made a
brief stay, after which she proceeded to New Bedford, the "hot-bed of
the fugitives" in Massachusetts, where by invitation she addressed a
public meeting on the subject of Education and the Elevation of the
Colored Race.

The occasion and result of the commencement of her public career was
thus given by her own pen in a letter dated August, 1854:


    "Well, I am out lecturing. I have lectured every night this
    week; besides addressed a Sunday-school, and I shall speak, if
    nothing prevent, to-night. My lectures have met with success.
    Last night I lectured in a white church in Providence. Mr.
    Gardener was present, and made the estimate of about six hundred
    persons. Never, perhaps, was a speaker, old or young, favored
    with a more attentive audience.... My voice is not wanting in
    strength, as I am aware of, to reach pretty well over the house.
    The church was the Roger Williams; the pastor, a Mr. Furnell,
    who appeared to be a kind and Christian man.... My maiden
    lecture was Monday night in New Bedford on the Elevation and
    Education of our People. Perhaps as intellectual a place as any
    I was ever at of its size."


Having thus won her way to a favorable position as a lecturer, the
following month she was engaged by the State Anti-Slavery Society of
Maine, with what success appears from one of her letters bearing
date--Buckstown Centre, Sept. 28, 1854:


    "The agent of the State Anti-Slavery Society of Maine travels
    with me, and she is a pleasant, dear, sweet lady. I do like her
    so. We travel together, eat together, and sleep together. (She
    is a white woman.) In fact I have not been in one colored
    person's house since I left Massachusetts; but I have a pleasant
    time. My life reminds me of a beautiful dream. What a difference
    between this and York!... I have met with some of the kindest
    treatment up here that I have ever received.... I have lectured
    three times this week. After I went from Limerick, I went to
    Springvale; there I spoke on Sunday night at an Anti-Slavery
    meeting. Some of the people are Anti-Slavery, Anti-rum and
    Anti-Catholic; and if you could see our Maine ladies,--some of
    them among the noblest types of womanhood you have ever seen!
    They are for putting men of Anti-Slavery principles in office,
    ... to cleanse the corrupt fountains of our government by
    sending men to Congress who will plead for our down-trodden and
    oppressed brethren, our crushed and helpless sisters, whose
    tears and blood bedew our soil, whose chains are clanking 'neath
    our proudest banners, whose cries and groans amid our loudest
    paeans rise."


Everywhere in this latitude doors opened before her, and her gifts were
universally recognized as a valuable acquisition to the cause. In the
letter above referred to she said: "I spoke in Boston on Monday
night.... Well, I am but one, but can do something, and, God helping me,
I will try. Mr. Brister from Lowell addressed the meeting; also Rev.
---- Howe. We had a good demonstration."

Having read the narrative of Solomon Northrup (12 years a slave), she
was led to embrace the Free Labor doctrine most thoroughly; and in a
letter dated at Temple, Maine, Oct. 20, 1854, after expressing the
interest she took in the annual meeting of the Anti-Slavery Society of
that state, she remarked:


    "I spoke on Free Produce, and now by the way I believe in that
    kind of Abolition. Oh, it does seem to strike at one of the
    principal roots of the matter. I have commenced since I read
    Solomon Northrup. Oh, if Mrs. Stowe has clothed American slavery
    in the graceful garb of fiction, Solomon Northrup comes up from
    the dark habitation of Southern cruelty where slavery fattens
    and feasts on human blood with such mournful revelations that
    one might almost wish for the sake of humanity that the tales of
    horror which he reveals were not so. Oh, how can we pamper our
    appetites upon luxuries drawn from reluctant fingers? Oh, could
    slavery exist long if it did not sit on a commercial throne? I
    have read somewhere, if I remember aright, of a Hindoo being
    loth to cut a tree because being a believer in the
    transmigration of souls, he thought the soul of his father had
    passed into it ... Oh, friend, beneath the most delicate
    preparations of the cane can you not see the stinging lash and
    clotted whip? I have reason to be thankful that I am able to
    give a little more for a Free Labor dress, if it is coarser. I
    can thank God that upon its warp and woof I see no stain of
    blood and tears; that to procure a little finer muslin for my
    limbs no crushed and broken heart went out in sighs, and that
    from the field where it was raised went up no wild and startling
    cry unto the throne of God to witness there in language deep and
    strong, that in demanding that cotton I was nerving oppression's
    hand for deeds of guilt and crime. If the liberation of the
    slave demanded it, I could consent to part with a portion of the
    blood from my own veins if that would do him any good."


After having thus alluded to free labor, she gave a short journal of the
different places where she had recently lectured from the 5th of
September to the 20th of October, which we mention here simply to show
the perseverance which characterized her as an advocate of her enslaved
race, and at the same time show how doors everywhere opened to her:
Portland, Monmouth Centre, North Berwick, Limerick (two meetings),
Springvale, Portsmouth, Elliott, Waterborough (spoke four times), Lyman,
Saccarappo, Moderation, Steep Falls (twice), North Buxton, Goram,
Gardner, Litchfield, twice, Monmouth Ridge twice, Monmouth Centre three
times, Litchfield second time, West Waterville twice, Livermore Temple.
Her ability and labors were everywhere appreciated, and her meetings
largely attended. In a subsequent letter referring to the manner that
she was received, she wrote, "A short while ago when I was down this way
I took breakfast with the then Governor of Maine."

For a year and a half she continued in the Eastern States, speaking in
most or all of them with marked success; the papers meting out to her
full commendation for her efforts. The following extract clipped from
the Portland Daily Press, respecting a lecture that she was invited to
deliver after the war by the Mayor (Mr. Washburne) and others, is a fair
sample of notices from this source:


    "She spoke for nearly an hour and a half, her subject being 'The
    Mission of the War, and the Demands of the Colored Race in the
    Work of Reconstruction;' and we have seldom seen an audience
    more attentive, better pleased, or more enthusiastic. Mrs.
    Harper has a splendid articulation, uses chaste, pure language,
    has a pleasant voice, and allows no one to tire of hearing her.
    We shall attempt no abstract of her address; none that we could
    make would do her justice. It was one of which any lecturer
    might feel proud, and her reception by a Portland audience was
    all that could be desired. We have seen no praises of her that
    were overdrawn. We have heard Miss Dickinson, and do not
    hesitate to award the palm to her darker colored sister."


In 1856, desiring to see the fugitives in Canada, she visited the Upper
Province, and in a letter dated at Niagara Falls, Sept. 12th, she
unfolded her mind in the following language:


    "Well, I have gazed for the first time upon Free Land, and,
    would you believe it, tears sprang to my eyes, and I wept. Oh,
    it was a glorious sight to gaze for the first time on a land
    where a poor slave flying from our glorious land of liberty
    would in a moment find his fetters broken, his shackles loosed,
    and whatever he was in the land of Washington, beneath the
    shadow of Bunker Hill Monument or even Plymouth Rock, here he
    becomes a man and a brother. I have gazed on Harper's Ferry, or
    rather the rock at the Ferry; I have seen it towering up in
    simple grandeur, with the gentle Potomac gliding peacefully at
    its feet, and felt that that was God's masonry, and my soul had
    expanded in gazing on its sublimity. I have seen the ocean
    singing its wild chorus of sounding waves, and ecstacy has
    thrilled upon the living chords of my heart. I have since then
    seen the rainbow-crowned Niagara chanting the choral hymn of
    Omnipotence, girdled with grandeur, and robed with glory; but
    none of these things have melted me as the first sight of Free
    Land. Towering mountains lifting their hoary summits to catch
    the first faint flush of day when the sunbeams kiss the shadows
    from morning's drowsy face may expand and exalt your soul. The
    first view of the ocean may fill you with strange delight.
    Niagara--the great, the glorious Niagara--may hush your spirit
    with its ceaseless thunder; it may charm you with its robe of
    crested spray and rainbow crown; but the land of Freedom was a
    lesson of deeper significance than foaming waves or towering
    mounts."


While in Toronto she lectured, and was listened to with great interest;
but she made only a brief visit, thence returning to Philadelphia, her
adopted home.

With her newly acquired reputation as a lecturer, from 1856 to 1859 she
continued her labors in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, &c. In
the meantime she often came in contact with Underground Rail Road
passengers, especially in Philadelphia. None sympathized with them more
sincerely or showed a greater willingness to render them material aid.
She contributed apparently with the same liberality as though they were
her own near kin. Even when at a distance, so deep was her interest in
the success of the Road, she frequently made it her business to forward
donations, and carefully inquire into the state of the treasury. The
Chairman of the Committee might publish a volume of interesting letters
from her pen relating to the Underground Rail Road and kindred topics;
but a few extracts must suffice. We here copy from a letter dated at
Rushsylvania, Ohio, Dec. 15th: "I send you to-day two dollars for the
Underground Rail Road. It is only a part of what I subscribed at your
meeting. May God speed the flight of the slave as he speeds through our
Republic to gain his liberty in a monarchical land. I am still in the
lecturing field, though not very strong physically.... Send me word what
I can do for the fugitive."

From Tiffin, Ohio, March 31st, touching the news of a rescue in
Philadelphia, she thus wrote:


    "I see by the Cincinnati papers that you have had an attempted
    rescue and a failure. That is sad! Can you not give me the
    particulars? and if there is anything that I can do for them in
    money or words, call upon me. This is a common cause; and if
    there is any burden to be borne in the
    Anti-Slavery-cause--anything to be done to weaken our hateful
    chains or assert our manhood and womanhood, I have a right to do
    my share of the work. The humblest and feeblest of us can do
    something; and though I may be deficient in many of the
    conventionalisms of city life, and be considered as a person of
    good impulses, but unfinished, yet if there is common rough work
    to be done, call on me."


Mrs. Harper was not content to make speeches and receive plaudits, but
was ever willing to do the rough work and to give material aid wherever
needed.

From another letter dated Lewis Centre, Ohio, we copy the following
characteristic extract:


    "Yesterday I sent you thirty dollars. Take five of it for the
    rescuers (who were in prison), and the rest pay away on the
    books. My offering is not large; but if you need more, send me
    word. Also how comes on the Underground Rail Road? Do you need
    anything for that? You have probably heard of the shameful
    outrage of a colored man or boy named Wagner, who was kidnapped
    in Ohio and carried across the river and sold for a slave....
    Ohio has become a kind of a negro hunting ground, a new Congo's
    coast and Guinea's shore. A man was kidnapped almost under the
    shadow of our capital. Oh, was it not dreadful?... Oh, may the
    living God prepare me for an earnest and faithful advocacy of
    the cause of justice and right!"


In those days the blows struck by the hero, John Brown, were agitating
the nation. Scarcely was it possible for a living soul to be more deeply
affected than this female advocate. Nor did her sympathies end in mere
words. She tendered material aid as well as heartfelt commiseration.

To John Brown's wife[A] she sent through the writer the following
letter:

[Footnote A: Mrs. Harper passed two weeks with Mrs. Brown at the house
of the writer while she was awaiting the execution of her husband, and
sympathized with her most deeply.]



LETTER TO JOHN BROWN'S WIFE.



    FARMER CENTRE, OHIO, Nov. 14th.

    MY DEAR MADAM:--In an hour like this the common words of
    sympathy may seem like idle words, and yet I want to say
    something to you, the noble wife of the hero of the nineteenth
    century. Belonging to the race your dear husband reached forth
    his hand to assist, I need not tell you that my sympathies are
    with you. I thank you for the brave words you have spoken. A
    republic that produces such a wife and mother may hope for
    better days. Our heart may grow more hopeful for humanity when
    it sees the sublime sacrifice it is about to receive from his
    hands. Not in vain has your dear husband periled all, if the
    martyrdom of one hero is worth more than the life of a million
    cowards. From the prison comes forth a shout of triumph over
    that power whose ethics are robbery of the feeble and oppression
    of the weak, the trophies of whose chivalry are a plundered
    cradle and a scourged and bleeding woman. Dear sister, I thank
    you for the brave and noble words that you have spoken. Enclosed
    I send you a few dollars as a token of my gratitude, reverence
    and love.

    Yours respectfully,

    FRANCES ELLEN WATKINS.

    Post Office address: care of William Still, 107 Fifth St.,
    Philadelphia, Penn.

    May God, our own God, sustain you in the hour of trial. If there
    is one thing on earth I can do for you or yours, let me be
    apprized. I am at your service.


Not forgetting Brown's comrades, who were then lying in prison under
sentence of death, true to the best impulses of her generous heart, she
thus wrote relative to these ill-fated prisoners, from Montpelier, Dec.
12th:


    "I thank you for complying with my request. (She had previously
    ordered a box of things to be forwarded to them.) And also that
    you wrote to them. You see Brown towered up so bravely that
    these doomed and fated men may have been almost overlooked, and
    just think that I am able to send one ray through the night
    around them. And as their letters came too late to answer in
    time, I am better satisfied that you wrote. I hope the things
    will reach them. Poor doomed and fated men! Why did you not send
    them more things? Please send me the bill of expense.... Send me
    word what I can do for the fugitives. Do you need any money? Do
    I not owe you on the old bill (pledge)? Look carefully and see
    if I have paid all. Along with this letter I send you one for
    Mr. Stephens (one of Brown's men), and would ask you to send him
    a box of nice things every week till he dies or is acquitted. I
    understand the balls have not been extracted from him. Has not
    this suffering been overshadowed by the glory that gathered
    around the brave old man?... Spare no expense to make the last
    hours of his (Stephens') life as bright as possible with
    sympathy.... Now, my friend, fulfil this to the letter. Oh, is
    it not a privilege, if you are sisterless and lonely, to be a
    sister to the human race, and to place your heart where it may
    throb close to down-trodden humanity?"


On another occasion in writing from the lecturing field hundreds of
miles away from Philadelphia, the sympathy she felt for the fugitives
found expression in the following language:


    "How fared the girl who came robed in male attire? Do write me
    every time you write how many come to your house; and, my dear
    friend, if you have that much in hand of mine from my books,
    will you please pay the Vigilance Committee two or three dollars
    for me to help carry on the glorious enterprise. Now, please do
    not write back that you are not going to do any such thing. Let
    me explain a few matters to you. In the first place, I am able
    to give something. In the second place, I am willing to do
    so.... Oh, life is fading away, and we have but an hour of time!
    Should we not, therefore, endeavor to let its history gladden
    the earth? The nearer we ally ourselves to the wants and woes of
    humanity in the spirit of Christ, the closer we get to the great
    heart of God; the nearer we stand by the beating of the pulse of
    universal love."


Doubtless it has not often been found necessary for persons desirous of
contributing to benevolent causes to first have to remove anticipated
objections. Nevertheless in some cases it would seem necessary to
admonish her not to be quite so liberal; to husband with a little more
care her hard-earned income for a "rainy day," as her health was not
strong.

"My health," she wrote at that time, "is not very strong, and I may have
to give up before long. I may have to yield on account of my voice,
which I think, has become somewhat affected. I might be so glad if it
was only so that I could go home among my own kindred and people, but
slavery comes up like a dark shadow between me and the home of my
childhood. Well, perhaps it is my lot to die from home and be buried
among strangers; and yet I do not regret that I have espoused this
cause; perhaps I have been of some service to the cause of human rights,
and I hope the consciousness that I have not lived in vain, will be a
halo of peace around my dying bed; a heavenly sunshine lighting up the
dark valley and shadow of death."

Notwithstanding this yearning for home, she was far from desiring at her
death, a burial in a Slave State, as the following clearly expressed
views show:


    "I have lived in the midst of oppression and wrong, and I am
    saddened by every captured fugitive in the North; a blow has
    been struck at my freedom, in every hunted and down-trodden
    slave in the South; North and South have both been guilty, and
    they that sin must suffer."


Also, in harmony with the above sentiments, came a number of verses
appropriate to her desires in this respect, one of which we here give as
a sample:


  "Make me a grave where'er you will,
  In a lowly plain, or a lofty hill,
  Make it among earth's humblest graves,
  But not in a land where men are slaves."


In the State of Maine the papers brought to her notice the capture of
Margaret Garner, and the tragic and bloody deed connected therewith. And
she writes:


    "Rome had her altars where the trembling criminal, and the worn
    and weary slave might fly for an asylum--Judea her cities of
    refuge; but Ohio, with her Bibles and churches, her baptisms and
    prayers, had not one temple so dedicated to human rights, one
    altar so consecrated to human liberty, that trampled upon and
    down-trodden innocence knew that it could find protection for a
    night, or shelter for a day."


In the fall of 1860, in the city of Cincinnati, Mrs. Harper was married
to Fenton Harper, a widower, and resident of Ohio. It seemed obvious
that this change would necessarily take her from the sphere of her
former usefulness. The means she had saved from the sale of her books
and from her lectures, she invested in a small farm near Columbus, and
in a short time after her marriage she entered upon house-keeping.

Notwithstanding her family cares, consequent upon married life, she only
ceased from her literary and anti-slavery labors, when compelled to do
so by other duties.

On the 23d of May, 1864, death deprived her of her husband.

Whilst she could not give so much attention to writing as she could have
desired in her household days, she, nevertheless, did then produce some
of her best productions. Take the following for a sample, on the return
from Cleveland, Ohio, of a poor, ill-fated slave-girl, (under the
Fugitive Slave Law):


TO THE UNION SAVERS OF CLEVELAND.


  Men of Cleveland, had a vulture
    Sought a timid dove for prey,
  Would you not, with human pity,
    Drive the gory bird away?


  Had you seen a feeble lambkin,
    Shrinking from a wolf so bold,
  Would ye not to shield the trembler,
    In your arms have made its fold?


  But when she, a hunted sister,
    Stretched her hands that ye might save,
  Colder far than Zembla's regions
    Was the answer that ye gave.


  On the Union's bloody altar,
    Was your hapless victim laid;
  Mercy, truth and justice shuddered,
    But your hands would give no aid.


  And ye sent her back to torture,
    Robbed of freedom and of right.
  Thrust the wretched, captive stranger.
    Back to slavery's gloomy night.


  Back where brutal men may trample,
    On her honor and her fame;
  And unto her lips so dusky,
    Press the cup of woe and shame.


  There is blood upon your city,
    Dark and dismal is the stain;
  And your hands would fail to cleanse it,
    Though Lake Erie ye should drain.


  There's a curse upon your Union,
    Fearful sounds are in the air;
  As if thunderbolts were framing,
    Answers to the bondsman's prayer.


  Ye may offer human victims,
    Like the heathen priests of old;
  And may barter manly honor
    For the Union and for gold.


  But ye can not stay the whirlwind,
    When the storm begins to break;
  And our God doth rise in judgment,
    For the poor and needy's sake.


  And, your sin-cursed, guilty Union,
    Shall be shaken to its base,
  Till ye learn that simple justice,
    Is the right of every race.


Mrs. Harper took the deepest interest in the war, and looked with
extreme anxiety for the results; and she never lost an opportunity to
write, speak, or serve the cause in any way that she thought would best
promote the freedom of the slave. On the proclamation of General
Fremont, the passages from her pen are worthy to be long remembered:


    "Well, what think you of the war? To me one of the most
    interesting features is Fremont's Proclamation freeing the
    slaves of the rebels. Is there no ray of hope in that? I should
    not wonder if Edward M. Davis breathed that into his ear. His
    proclamation looks like real earnestness; no mincing the matter
    with the rebels. Death to the traitors and confiscation of their
    slaves is no child's play. I hope that the boldness of his stand
    will inspire others to look the real cause of the war in the
    face and inspire the government with uncompromising earnestness
    to remove the festering curse. And yet I am not uneasy about the
    result of this war. We may look upon it as God's controversy
    with the nation; His arising to plead by fire and blood the
    cause of His poor and needy people. Some time since
    Breckinridge, in writing to Sumner, asks, if I rightly remember,
    What is the fate of a few negroes to me or mine? Bound up in one
    great bundle of humanity our fates seem linked together, our
    destiny entwined with theirs, and our rights are interwoven
    together."


Finally when the long-looked-for Emancipation Proclamation came,
although Mrs. Harper was not at that time very well, she accepted an
invitation to address a public meeting in Columbus, Ohio, an allusion to
which we find in a letter dated at Grove City, O., which we copy with
the feeling that many who may read this volume will sympathize with
every word uttered relative to the Proclamation:


    "I spoke in Columbus on the President's Proclamation.... But was
    not such an event worthy the awakening of every power--the
    congratulation of every faculty? What hath God wrought! We may
    well exclaim how event after event has paved the way for
    freedom. In the crucible of disaster and defeat God has stirred
    the nation, and permitted no permanent victory to crown her
    banners while she kept her hand upon the trembling slave and
    held him back from freedom. And even now the scale may still
    seem to oscillate between the contending parties, and some may
    say, Why does not God give us full and quick victory? My friend,
    do not despair if even deeper shadows gather around the fate of
    the nation, that truth will not ultimately triumph, and the
    right be established and vindicated; but the deadly gangrene has
    taken such deep and almost fatal hold upon the nation that the
    very centres of its life seem to be involved in its eradication.
    Just look, after all the trials deep and fiery through which the
    nation has waded, how mournfully suggestive was the response the
    proclamation received from the democratic triumphs which
    followed so close upon its footsteps. Well, thank God that the
    President did not fail us, that the fierce rumbling of
    democratic thunder did not shake from his hand the bolt he
    leveled against slavery. Oh, it would have been so sad if, after
    all the desolation and carnage that have dyed our plains with
    blood and crimsoned our borders with warfare, the pale young
    corpses trodden down by the hoofs of war, the dim eyes that have
    looked their last upon the loved and lost, had the arm of
    Executive power failed us in the nation's fearful crisis! For
    how mournful it is when the unrighted wrongs and fearful agonies
    of ages reach their culminating point, and events solemn,
    terrible and sublime marshal themselves in dread array to mould
    the destiny of nations, the hands appointed to hold the helm of
    affairs, instead of grasping the mighty occasions and stamping
    them with the great seals of duty and right, permit them to
    float along the current of circumstances without comprehending
    the hour of visitation or the momentous day of opportunity. Yes,
    we may thank God that in the hour when the nation's life was
    convulsed, and fearful gloom had shed its shadows over the land,
    the President reached out his hand through the darkness to break
    the chains on which the rust of centuries had gathered. Well,
    did you ever expect to see this day? I know that all is not
    accomplished; but we may rejoice in what has been already
    wrought,--the wondrous change in so short a time. Just a little
    while since the American flag to the flying bondman was an
    ensign of bondage; now it has become a symbol of protection and
    freedom. Once the slave was a despised and trampled on pariah;
    now he has become a useful ally to the American government. From
    the crimson sods of war springs the white flower of freedom, and
    songs of deliverance mingle with the crash and roar of war. The
    shadow of the American army becomes a covert for the slave, and
    beneath the American Eagle he grasps the key of knowledge and is
    lifted to a higher destiny."


This letter we had intended should complete the sketch of Mrs. Harper's
Anti-Slavery labors; but in turning to another epistle dated Boston,
April 19th, on the Assassination of the President, we feel that a part
of it is too interesting to omit:


    "Sorrow treads on the footsteps of the nation's joy. A few days
    since the telegraph thrilled and throbbed with a nation's joy.
    To-day a nation sits down beneath the shadow of its mournful
    grief. Oh, what a terrible lesson does this event read to us! A
    few years since slavery tortured, burned, hung and outraged us,
    and the nation passed by and said, they had nothing to do with
    slavery where it was, slavery would have something to do with
    them where they were. Oh, how fearfully the judgments of Ichabod
    have pressed upon the nation's life! Well, it may be in the
    providence of God this blow was needed to intensify the nation's
    hatred of slavery, to show the utter fallacy of basing national
    reconstruction upon the votes of returned rebels, and rejecting
    loyal black men; making (after all the blood poured out like
    water, and wealth scattered like chaff) a return to the old idea
    that a white rebel is better or of more account in the body
    politic than a loyal black man.... Moses, the meekest man on
    earth, led the children of Israel over the Red Sea, but was not
    permitted to see them settled in Canaan. Mr. Lincoln has led up
    through another Red Sea to the table land of triumphant victory,
    and God has seen fit to summon for the new era another man. It
    is ours then to bow to the Chastener and let our honored and
    loved chieftain go. Surely the everlasting arms that have hushed
    him so strangely to sleep are able to guide the nation through
    its untrod future; but in vain should be this fearful baptism of
    blood if from the dark bosom of slavery springs such terrible
    crimes. Let the whole nation resolve that the whole virus shall
    be eliminated from its body; that in the future slavery shall
    only be remembered as a thing of the past that shall never have
    the faintest hope of a resurrection."


Up to this point, we have spoken of Mrs. Harper as a laborer, battling
for freedom under slavery and the war. She is equally earnest in
laboring for Equality before the law--education, and a higher manhood,
especially in the South, among the Freedmen.

For the best part of several years, since the war, she has traveled very
extensively through the Southern States, going on the plantations and
amongst the lowly, as well as to the cities and towns, addressing
schools, Churches, meetings in Court Houses, Legislative Halls, &c.,
and, sometimes, under the most trying and hazardous circumstances;
influenced in her labor of love, wholly by the noble impulses of her own
heart, working her way along unsustained by any Society. In this
mission, she has come in contact with all classes--the original
slaveholders and the Freedmen, before and since the Fifteenth Amendment
bill was enacted. Excepting two of the Southern States (Texas and
Arkansas), she has traveled largely over all the others, and in no
instance has she permitted herself, through fear, to disappoint an
audience, when engagements had been made for her to speak, although
frequently admonished that it would be dangerous to venture in so doing.

We first quote from a letter dated Darlington, S.C., May 13, 1867:


    "You will see by this that I am in the sunny South.... I here
    read and see human nature under new lights and phases. I meet
    with a people eager to hear, ready to listen, as if they felt
    that the slumber of the ages had been broken, and that they were
    to sleep no more.... I am glad that the colored man gets his
    freedom and suffrage together; that he is not forced to go
    through the same condition of things here, that has inclined him
    so much to apathy, isolation, and indifference, in the North.
    You, perhaps, wonder why I have been so slow in writing to you,
    but if you knew how busy I am, just working up to or past the
    limit of my strength. Traveling, conversing, addressing day and
    Sunday-schools (picking up scraps of information, takes up a
    large portion of my time), besides what I give to reading. For
    my audiences I have both white and colored. On the cars, some
    find out that I am a lecturer, and then, again, I am drawn into
    conversation. 'What are you lecturing about?' the question comes
    up, and if I say, among other topics politics, then I may look
    for an onset. There is a sensitiveness on this subject, a dread,
    it may be, that some one will 'put the devil in the nigger's
    head,' or exert some influence inimical to them; still, I get
    along somewhat pleasantly. Last week I had a small congregation
    of listeners in the cars, where I sat. I got in conversation
    with a former slave dealer, and we had rather an exciting time.
    I was traveling alone, but it is not worth while to show any
    signs of fear.  *  *  *Last Saturday I spoke in Sumter; a number
    of white persons were present, and I had been invited to speak
    there by the Mayor and editor of the paper. There had been some
    violence in the district, and some of my friends did not wish me
    to go, but I had promised, and, of course, I went.  *  *  *  *
    I am in Darlington, and spoke yesterday, but my congregation was
    so large, that I stood near the door of the church, so that I
    might be heard both inside and out, for a large portion, perhaps
    nearly half my congregation were on the outside; and this, in
    Darlington, where, about two years ago, a girl was hung for
    making a childish and indiscreet speech. Victory was perched on
    our banners. Our army had been through, and this poor, ill-fated
    girl, almost a child in years, about seventeen years of age,
    rejoiced over the event, and said that she was going to marry a
    Yankee and set up housekeeping. She was reported as having made
    an incendiary speech and arrested, cruelly scourged, and then
    brutally hung. Poor child! she had been a faithful servant--her
    master tried to save her, but the tide of fury swept away his
    efforts.  *  *  *  Oh, friend, perhaps, sometimes your heart
    would ache, if you were only here and heard of the wrongs and
    abuses to which these people have been subjected.  *  *  *
    Things, I believe, are a little more hopeful; at least, I
    believe, some of the colored people are getting better
    contracts, and, I understand, that there's less murdering. While
    I am writing, a colored man stands here, with a tale of
    wrong--he has worked a whole year, year before last, and now he
    has been put off with fifteen bushels of corn and his food;
    yesterday he went to see about getting his money, and the person
    to whom he went, threatened to kick him off, and accused him of
    stealing. I don't know how the colored man will vote, but
    perhaps many of them will be intimidated at the polls."


From a letter dated Cheraw, June 17th, 1867, the following remarks are
taken:


    "Well, Carolina is an interesting place. There is not a state in
    the Union I prefer to Carolina. Kinder, more hospitable,
    warmer-hearted people perhaps you will not find anywhere. I have
    been to Georgia; but Carolina is my preference.  *  *  The South
    is to be a great theatre for the colored man's development and
    progress. There is brain-power here. If any doubt it, let him
    come into our schools, or even converse with some of our
    Freedmen either in their homes or by the way-side."


A few days later she gave an account of a visit she had just made in
Florence, where our poor soldiers had been prisoners; saw some of the
huts where they were exposed to rain and heat and cold with only the
temporary shelter they made for themselves, which was a sad sight. Then
she visited the grave-yards of some thousands of Union soldiers. Here in
"eastern South Carolina" she was in "one of the worst parts of the
State" in the days of Slavery; but under the new order of things,
instead of the lash, she saw school books, and over the ruins of
slavery, education and free speech springing up, at which she was moved
to exclaim, "Thank God for the wonderful change! I have lectured several
nights this week, and the weather is quite warm; but I do like South
Carolina. No state in the Union as far as colored people are concerned,
do I like better--the land of warm welcomes and friendly hearts. God
bless her and give her great peace!"

At a later period she visited Charleston and Columbia, and was well
received in both places. She spoke a number of times in the different
Freedmen schools and the colored churches in Charleston, once in the
Legislative Hall, and also in one of the colored churches in Columbia.
She received special encouragement and kindness from Hon. H. Cadoza,
Secretary of State, and his family, and regarded him as a wise and
upright leader of his race in that state.

The following are some stirring lines which she wrote upon the Fifteenth
Amendment:


FIFTEENTH AMENDMENT.


  Beneath the burden of our joy
    Tremble, O wires, from East to West!
  Fashion with words your tongues of fire,
    To tell the nation's high behest.


  Outstrip the winds, and leave behind
    The murmur of the restless waves;
  Nor tarry with your glorious news,
    Amid the ocean's coral caves.


  Ring out! ring out! your sweetest chimes,
    Ye bells, that call to praise;
  Let every heart with gladness thrill,
    And songs of joyful triumph raise.


  Shake off the dust, O rising race!
    Crowned as a brother and a man;
  Justice to-day asserts her claim,
    And from thy brow fades out the ban.


  With freedom's chrism upon thy head,
    Her precious ensign in thy hand,
  Go place thy once despised name
    Amid the noblest of the land.


  O ransomed race! give God the praise,
    Who led thee through a crimson sea,
  And 'mid the storm of fire and blood,
    Turned out the war-cloud's light to thee.


Mrs. Harper, in writing from Kingstree, S.C., July 11th, 1867, in
midsummer (laboring almost without any pecuniary reward), gave an
account of a fearful catastrophe which had just occurred there in the
burning of the jail with a number of colored prisoners in it. "It was a
very sad affair. There was only one white prisoner and he got out. I
believe there was some effort made to release some of the prisoners; but
the smoke was such that the effort proved ineffectual. Well, for the
credit of our common human nature we may hope that it was so.  *  *  *
Last night I had some of the 'rebs' to hear me (part of the time some of
the white folks come out). Our meetings are just as quiet and as orderly
on the whole in Carolina as one might desire.  *  *  I like General
Sickles as a Military Governor. 'Massa Daniel, he King of the
Carolinas.' I like his Mastership. Under him we ride in the City Cars,
and get first-class passage on the railroad." At this place a colored
man was in prison under sentence of death for "participating in a riot;"
and the next day (after the date of her letter) was fixed for his
execution. With some others, Mrs. Harper called at General Sickles' Head
Quarters, hoping to elicit his sympathies whereby the poor fellow's life
might be saved; but he was not in. Hence they were not able to do
anything.

"Next week," continued Mrs. Harper, "I am to speak in a place where one
of our teachers was struck and a colored man shot, who, I believe, gave
offence by some words spoken at a public meeting. I do not feel any
particular fear."

Her Philadelphia correspondent had jestingly suggested to her in one of
his letters, that she should be careful not to allow herself to be
"bought by the rebels." To which she replied:


    "Now, in reference to being bought by rebels and becoming a
    Johnsonite I hold that between the white people and the colored
    there is a community of interests, and the sooner they find it
    out, the better it will be for both parties; but that community
    of interests does not consist in increasing the privileges of
    one class and curtailing the rights of the other, but in getting
    every citizen interested in the welfare, progress and durability
    of the state. I do not in lecturing confine myself to the
    political side of the question. While I am in favor of Universal
    suffrage, yet I know that the colored man needs something more
    than a vote in his hand: he needs to know the value of a home
    life; to rightly appreciate and value the marriage relation; to
    know how and to be incited to leave behind him the old shards
    and shells of slavery and to rise in the scale of character,
    wealth and influence. Like the Nautilus outgrowing his home to
    build for himself more 'stately temples' of social condition. A
    man landless, ignorant and poor may use the vote against his
    interests; but with intelligence and land he holds in his hand
    the basis of power and elements of strength."


While contemplating the great demand for laborers, in a letter from
Athens, February 1st, 1870, after referring to some who had been
"discouraged from the field," she wisely added that it was "no time to
be discouraged."


    *  *  *  "If those who can benefit our people will hang around
    places where they are not needed, they may expect to be
    discouraged.  *  *  *  Here is ignorance to be instructed; a
    race who needs to be helped up to higher planes of thought and
    action; and whether we are hindered or helped, we should try to
    be true to the commission God has written upon our souls. As far
    as the colored people are concerned, they are beginning to get
    homes for themselves and depositing money in Bank. They have
    hundreds of homes in Kentucky. There is progress in Tennessee,
    and even in this State while a number have been leaving, some
    who stay seem to be getting along prosperously. In Augusta
    colored persons are in the Revenue Office and Post Office. I
    have just been having some good meetings there. Some of my
    meetings pay me poorly; but I have a chance to instruct and
    visit among the people and talk to their Sunday-schools and
    day-schools also. Of course I do not pretend that all are saving
    money or getting homes. I rather think from what I hear that the
    interest of the grown-up people in getting education has
    somewhat subsided, owing, perhaps, in a measure, to the novelty
    having worn off and the absorption or rather direction of the
    mind to other matters. Still I don't think that I have visited
    scarcely a place since last August where there was no desire for
    a teacher; and Mr. Fidler, who is a Captain or Colonel, thought
    some time since that there were more colored than white who were
    learning or had learned to read. There has been quite an amount
    of violence and trouble in the State; but we have the military
    here, and if they can keep Georgia out of the Union about a year
    or two longer, and the colored people continue to live as they
    have been doing, from what I hear, perhaps these rebels will
    learn a little more sense. I have been in Atlanta for some time,
    but did not stay until the Legislature was organized; but I was
    there when colored members returned and took their seats. It was
    rather a stormy time in the House; but no blood was shed. Since
    then there has been some 'sticking;' but I don't think any of
    the colored ones were in it."


In the neighborhood of Eufaula, Ala., in December, 1870, Mrs. Harper did
a good work, as may be seen from the following extract taken from a
letter, dated December 9th:


    "Last evening I visited one of the plantations, and had an
    interesting time. Oh, how warm was the welcome! I went out near
    dark, and between that time and attending my lecture, I was out
    to supper in two homes. The people are living in the old cabins
    of slavery; some of them have no windows, at all, that I see; in
    fact, I don't remember of having seen a pane of window-glass in
    the settlement. But, humble as their homes were, I was kindly
    treated, and well received; and what a chance one has for
    observation among these people, if one takes with her a manner
    that unlocks other hearts. I had quite a little gathering, after
    less, perhaps, than a day's notice; the minister did not know
    that I was coming, till he met me in the afternoon. There was no
    fire in the church, and so they lit fires outside, and we
    gathered, or at least a number of us, around the fire. To-night
    I am going over to Georgia to lecture. In consequence of the low
    price of cotton, the people may not be able to pay much, and I
    am giving all my lectures free. You speak of things looking dark
    in the South; there is no trouble here that I know of--cotton is
    low, but the people do not seem to be particularly depressed
    about it; this emigration question has been on the carpet, and I
    do not wonder if some of them, with their limited knowledge,
    lose hope in seeing full justice done to them, among their
    life-long oppressors; Congress has been agitating the St.
    Domingo question; a legitimate theme for discussion, and one
    that comes nearer home, is how they can give more security and
    strength to the government which we have established in the
    South--for there has been a miserable weakness in the security
    to human life. The man with whom I stopped, had a son who
    married a white woman, or girl, and was shot down, and there
    was, as I understand, no investigation by the jury; and a number
    of cases have occurred of murders, for which the punishment has
    been very lax, or not at all, and, it may be, never will be;
    however, I rather think things are somewhat quieter. A few days
    ago a shameful outrage occurred at this place--some men had been
    out fox hunting, and came to the door of a colored woman and
    demanded entrance, making out they wanted fire; she replied that
    she had none, and refused to open the door; the miserable
    cowards broke open the door, and shamefully beat her. I am going
    to see her this afternoon. It is remarkable, however, in spite
    of circumstances, how some of these people are getting along.
    Here is a woman who, with her husband, at the surrender, had a
    single dollar; and now they have a home of their own, and
    several acres attached--five altogether; but, as that was rather
    small, her husband has contracted for two hundred and forty
    acres more, and has now gone out and commenced operations."


From Columbiana, February 20th, she wrote concerning her work, and
presented the "lights and shades" of affairs as they came under her
notice.


    "I am almost constantly either traveling or speaking. I do not
    think that I have missed more than one Sunday that I have not
    addressed some Sunday-school, and I have not missed many
    day-schools either. And as I am giving all my lectures free the
    proceeds of the collections are not often very large; still as
    ignorant as part of the people are perhaps a number of them
    would not hear at all, and may be prejudice others if I charged
    even ten cents, and so perhaps in the long run, even if my work
    is wearing, I may be of some real benefit to my race.  *  *  I
    don't know but that you would laugh if you were to hear some of
    the remarks which my lectures call forth: 'She is a man,' again
    'She is not colored, she is painted.' Both white and colored
    come out to hear me, and I have very fine meetings; and then
    part of the time I am talking in between times, and how tired I
    am some of the time. Still I am standing with my race on the
    threshold of a new era, and though some be far past me in the
    learning of the schools, yet to-day, with my limited and
    fragmentary knowledge, I may help the race forward a little.
    Some of our people remind me of sheep without a shepherd."

PRIVATE LECTURES TO FREEDWOMEN.


Desiring to speak to women who have been the objects of so much wrong
and abuse under Slavery, and even since Emancipation, in a state of
ignorance, not accessible always to those who would or could urge the
proper kind of education respecting their morals and general
improvement, Mrs. Harper has made it her business not to overlook this
all important duty to her poor sisters.

The following extract taken from a letter dated "Greenville, Georgia,
March 29th," will show what she was doing in this direction:


    "But really my hands are almost constantly full of work;
    sometimes I speak twice a day. Part of my lectures are given
    privately to women, and for them I never make any charge, or
    take up any collection. But this part of the country reminds me
    of heathen ground, and though my work may not be recognized as
    part of it used to be in the North, yet never perhaps were my
    services more needed; and according to their intelligence and
    means perhaps never better appreciated than here among these
    lowly people. I am now going to have a private meeting with the
    women of this place if they will come out. I am going to talk
    with them about their daughters, and about things connected with
    the welfare of the race. Now is the time for our women to begin
    to try to lift up their heads and plant the roots of progress
    under the hearthstone. Last night I spoke in a school-house,
    where there was not, to my knowledge, a single window glass;
    to-day I write to you in a lowly cabin, where the windows in the
    room are formed by two apertures in the wall. There is a
    wide-spread and almost universal appearance of poverty in this
    State where I have been, but thus far I have seen no, or
    scarcely any, pauperism. I am not sure that I have seen any. The
    climate is so fine, so little cold that poor people can live off
    of less than they can in the North. Last night my table was
    adorned with roses, although I did not get one cent for my
    lecture."  *  *  *

    "The political heavens are getting somewhat overcast. Some of
    this old rebel element, I think, are in favor of taking away the
    colored man's vote, and if he loses it now it may be generations
    before he gets it again. Well, after all perhaps the colored man
    generally is not really developed enough to value his vote and
    equality with other races, so he gets enough to eat and drink,
    and be comfortable, perhaps the loss of his vote would not be a
    serious grievance to many; but his children differently educated
    and trained by circumstances might feel political inferiority
    rather a bitter cup."

    "After all whether they encourage or discourage me, I belong to
    this race, and when it is down I belong to a down race; when it
    is up I belong to a risen race."


She writes thus from Montgomery, December 29th, 1870:


    "Did you ever read a little poem commencing, I think, with these
    words:


      A mother cried, Oh, give me joy,
      For I have born a darling boy!
      A darling boy! why the world is full
      Of the men who play at push and pull.


    Well, as full as the room was of beds and tenants, on the
    morning of the twenty-second, there arose a wail upon the air,
    and this mundane sphere had another inhabitant, and my room
    another occupant. I left after that, and when I came back the
    house was fuller than it was before, and my hostess gave me to
    understand that she would rather I should be somewhere else, and
    I left again. How did I fare? Well, I had been stopping with one
    of our teachers and went back; but the room in which I stopped
    was one of those southern shells through which both light and
    cold enter at the same time; it had one window and perhaps more
    than half or one half the panes gone. I don't know that I was
    ever more conquered by the cold than I had been at that house,
    and I have lived parts of winter after winter amid the snows of
    New England; but if it was cold out of doors, there was warmth
    and light within doors; but here, if you opened the door for
    light, the cold would also enter, and so part of the time I sat
    by the fire, and that and the crevices in the house supplied me
    with light in one room, and we had the deficient window-sash, or
    perhaps it never had had any lights in it. You could put your
    finger through some of the apertures in the house; at least I
    could mine, and the water froze down to the bottom of the
    tumbler. From another such domicile may kind fate save me. And
    then the man asked me four dollars and a half a week board.

    One of the nights there was no fire in the stove, and the next
    time we had fires, one stove might have been a second-hand
    chamber stove. Now perhaps you think these people very poor, but
    the man with whom I stopped has no family that I saw, but
    himself and wife, and he would make two dollars and a half a
    day, and she worked out and kept a boarder. And yet, except the
    beds and bed clothing, I wouldn't have given fifteen dollars for
    all their house furniture. I should think that this has been one
    of the lowest down States in the South, as far as civilization
    has been concerned. In the future, until these people are
    educated, look out for Democratic victories, for here are two
    materials with which Democracy can work, ignorance and poverty.
    Men talk about missionary work among the heathen, but if any
    lover of Christ wants a field for civilizing work, here is a
    field. Part of the time I am preaching against men ill-treating
    their wives. I have heard though, that often during the war men
    hired out their wives and drew their pay."


           *       *       *       *       *


    "And then there is another trouble, some of our Northern men
    have been down this way and by some means they have not made the
    best impression on every mind here. One woman here has been
    expressing her mind very freely to me about some of our
    Northerners, and we are not all considered here as saints and
    angels, and of course in their minds I get associated with some
    or all the humbugs that have been before me. But I am not
    discouraged, my race needs me, if I will only be faithful, and
    in spite of suspicion and distrust, I will work on; the deeper
    our degradation, the louder our call for redemption. If they
    have little or no faith in goodness and earnestness, that is
    only one reason why we should be more faithful and earnest, and
    so I shall probably stay here in the South all winter. I am not
    making much money, and perhaps will hardly clear expenses this
    winter; but after all what matters it when I am in my grave
    whether I have been rich or poor, loved or hated, despised or
    respected, if Christ will only own me to His Father, and I be
    permitted a place in one of the mansions of rest."


Col. J.W. Forney, editor of "The Press," published July 12, 1871, with
the brief editorial heading by his own hand, the document appended:


    The following letter, written by Mrs. F.E.W. Harper, the
    well-known colored orator, to a friend, Mr. Wm. Still, of
    Philadelphia, will be read with surprise and pleasure by all
    classes; especially supplemented as it is by an article from the
    Mobile (Alabama) _Register,_ referring to one of her addresses
    in that city. The _Register_ is the organ of the fire-eaters of
    the South, conducted by John Forsyth, heretofore one of the most
    intolerant of that school. Mrs. Harper describes the manner in
    which the old plantation of Jefferson Davis in Mississippi was
    cultivated by his brother's former slave, having been a guest in
    the Davis mansion, now occupied by Mr. Montgomery, the aforesaid
    slave. She also draws a graphic picture of her own marvellous
    advancement from utter obscurity to the platform of a public
    lecturer, honored by her own race and applauded by their
    oppressors. While we regret, as she says, that her experience
    and that of Mr. Montgomery is exceptional, it is easy to
    anticipate the harvest of such a sowing. The same culture--the
    same courage on the part of the men and women who undertake to
    advocate Republican doctrines in the South--the same
    perseverance and intelligence on the part of those who are
    earning their bread by the cultivation of the soil, will be
    crowned with the same success. Violence, bloodshed, and murder
    cannot rule long in communities where these resistless elements
    are allowed to work. No scene in the unparalleled tragedy of the
    rebellion, or in the drama which succeeded that tragedy, can be
    compared to the picture outlined by Mrs. Harper herself, and
    filled in by the ready pen of the rebel editor of the Mobile
    _Register_:


        MOBILE, July 5, 1871.

        MY DEAR FRIEND:--It is said that truth is stranger than
        fiction; and if ten years since some one had entered my
        humble log house and seen me kneading bread and making
        butter, and said that in less than ten years you will be
        in the lecture field, you will be a welcome guest under
        the roof of the President of the Confederacy, though not
        by special invitation from him, that you will see his
        brother's former slave a man of business and influence,
        that hundreds of colored men will congregate on the old
        baronial possessions, that a school will spring up there
        like a well in the desert dust, that this former slave
        will be a magistrate upon that plantation, that labor
        will be organized upon a new basis, and that under the
        sole auspices and moulding hands of this man and his
        sons will be developed a business whose transactions
        will be numbered in hundreds of thousands of dollars,
        would you not have smiled incredulously? And I have
        lived to see the day when the plantation has passed into
        new hands, and these hands once wore the fetters of
        slavery. Mr. Montgomery, the present proprietor by
        contract of between five and six thousand acres of land,
        has one of the most interesting families that I have
        ever seen in the South. They are building up a future
        which if exceptional now I hope will become more general
        hereafter. Every hand of his family is adding its quota
        to the success of this experiment of a colored man both
        trading and farming on an extensive scale. Last year his
        wife took on her hands about 130 acres of land, and with
        her force she raised about 107 bales of cotton. She has
        a number of orphan children employed, and not only does
        she supervise their labor, but she works herself. One
        daughter, an intelligent young lady, is postmistress and
        I believe assistant book-keeper. One son attends to the
        planting interest, and another daughter attends to one
        of the stores. The business of this firm of Montgomery &
        Sons has amounted, I understand, to between three and
        four hundred thousand dollars in a year. I stayed on the
        place several days and was hospitably entertained and
        kindly treated. When I come, if nothing prevents, I will
        tell you more about them. Now for the next strange
        truth. Enclosed I send you a notice from one of the
        leading and representative papers of rebeldom. The
        editor has been, or is considered, one of the
        representative men of the South. I have given a lecture
        since this notice, which brought out some of the most
        noted rebels, among whom was Admiral Semmes. In my
        speech I referred to the Alabama sweeping away our
        commerce, and his son sat near him and seemed to receive
        it with much good humor. I don't know what the papers
        will say to-day; perhaps they will think that I dwelt
        upon the past too much. Oh, if you had seen the rebs I
        had out last night, perhaps you would have felt a little
        nervous for me. However, I lived through it, and gave
        them more gospel truth than perhaps some of them have
        heard for some time.





A LECTURE.



    We received a polite invitation from the trustees of the
    State-street African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church to attend a
    lecture in that edifice on Thursday evening. Being told that the
    discourse would be delivered by a female colored lecturer from
    Maryland, curiosity, as well as an interest to see how the
    colored citizens were managing their own institutions, led us at
    once to accept the invitation. We found a very spacious church,
    gas-light, and the balustrades of the galleries copiously hung
    with wreaths and festoons of flowers, and a large audience of
    both sexes, which, both in appearance and behaviour, was
    respectable and decorously observant of the proprieties of the
    place. The services were opened, as usual, with prayer and a
    hymn, the latter inspired by powerful lungs, and in which the
    musical ear at once caught the negro talent for melody. The
    lecturer was then introduced as Mrs. F.E.W. Harper, from
    Maryland. Without a moment's hesitation she started off in the
    flow of her discourse, which rolled smoothly and uninterruptedly
    on for nearly two hours. It was very apparent that it was not a
    cut and dried speech, for she was as fluent and as felicitous in
    her allusions to circumstances immediately around her as she was
    when she rose to a more exalted pitch of laudation of the
    "Union," or of execration of the old slavery system. Her voice
    was remarkable--as sweet as any woman's voice we ever heard, and
    so clear and distinct as to pass every syllable to the most
    distant ear in the house.

    Without any effort at attentive listening we followed the
    speaker to the end, not discerning a single grammatical
    inaccuracy of speech, or the slightest violation of good taste
    in manner or matter. At times the current of thoughts flowed in
    eloquent and poetic expression, and often her quaint humor would
    expose the ivory in half a thousand mouths. We confess that we
    began to wonder, and we asked a fine-looking man before us,
    "What is her color? Is she dark or light?" He answered, "She is
    mulatto; what they call a red mulatto." The 'red' was new to us.
    Our neighbor asked, "How do you like her?" We replied, "She is
    giving your people the best kind and the very wisest of advice."
    He rejoined, "I wish I had her education." To which we added,
    "That's just what she tells you is your great duty and your
    need, and if you are too old to get it yourselves, you must give
    it to your children."

    The speaker left the impression on our mind that she was not
    only intelligent and educated, but--the great end of
    education--she was enlightened. She comprehends perfectly the
    situation of her people, to whose interests she seems ardently
    devoted. The main theme of her discourse, the one string to the
    harmony of which all the others were attuned, was the grand
    opportunity that emancipation had afforded to the black race to
    lift itself to the level of the duties and responsibilities
    enjoined by it. "You have muscle power and brain power," she
    said; "you must utilize them, or be content to remain forever
    the inferior race. Get land, every one that can, and as fast as
    you ean. A landless people must be dependent upon the landed
    people. A few acres to till for food and a roof, however bumble,
    over your head, are the castle of your independence, and when
    you have it you are fortified to act and vote independently
    whenever your interests are at stake." That part of her lecture
    (and there was much of it) that dwelt on the moral duties and
    domestic relations of the colored people was pitched on the
    highest key of sound morality. She urged the cultivation of the
    "home life," the sanctity of the marriage state (a happy
    contrast to her strong-minded, free-love, white sisters of the
    North), and the duties of mothers to their daughters. "Why,"
    said she in a voice of much surprise, "I have actually heard
    since I have been South that sometimes colored husbands
    positively beat their wives! I do not mean to insinuate for a
    moment that such things can possibly happen in Mobile. The very
    appearance of this congregation forbids it; but I did hear of
    one terrible husband defending himself for the unmanly practice
    with 'Well, I have got to whip her or leave her.'"

    There were parts of the lecturer's discourse that grated a
    little on a white Southern ear, but it was lost and forgiven in
    the genuine earnestness and profound good sense with which the
    woman spoke to her kind in words of sound advice.

    On the whole, we are very glad we accepted the Zion's
    invitation. It gave us much food for new thought. It reminded
    us, perhaps, of neglected duties to these people, and it
    impressed strongly on our minds that these people are getting
    along, getting onward, and progress was a star becoming familiar
    to their gaze and their desires. Whatever the negroes have done
    in the path of advancement, they have done largely without white
    aid. But politics and white pride have kept the white people
    aloof from offering that earnest and moral assistance which
    would be so useful to a people just starting from infancy into a
    life of self-dependence.


In writing from Columbiana and Demopolis, Alabama, about the first of
March, 1871, Mrs. Harper painted the state of affairs in her usually
graphic manner, and diligently was she endeavoring to inspire the people
with hope and encouragement.


    "Oh, what a field there is here in this region! Let me give you
    a short account of this week's work. Sunday I addressed a
    Sunday-school in Taladega; on Monday afternoon a day-school. On
    Monday I rode several miles to a meeting; addressed it, and came
    back the same night. Got back about or after twelve o'clock. The
    next day I had a meeting of women and addressed them, and then
    lectured in the evening in the Court-House to both colored and
    white. Last night I spoke again, about ten miles from where I am
    now stopping, and returned the same night, and to-morrow evening
    probably I shall speak again. I grow quite tired part of the
    time.  *  *  *  And now let me give you an anecdote or two of
    some of our new citizens. While in Taladega I was entertained
    and well entertained, at the house of one of our new citizens.
    He is living in the house of his former master. He is a
    brick-maker by trade, and I rather think mason also. He was
    worth to his owner, it was reckoned, fifteen hundred or about
    that a year. He worked with him seven years; and in that seven
    years he remembers receiving from him fifty cents. Now mark the
    contrast! That man is now free, owns the home of his former
    master, has I think more than sixty acres of land, and his
    master is in the poor-house. I heard of another such case not
    long since: A woman was cruelly treated once, or more than once.
    She escaped and ran naked into town. The villain in whose clutch
    she found herself was trying to drag her downward to his own low
    level of impurity, and at last she fell. She was poorly fed, so
    that she was tempted to sell her person. Even scraps thrown to
    the dog she was hunger-bitten enough to aim for. Poor thing, was
    there anything in the future for her? Had not hunger and cruelty
    and prostitution done their work, and left her an entire wreck
    for life? It seems not. Freedom came, and with it dawned a new
    era upon that poor, overshadowed, and sin-darkened life. Freedom
    brought opportunity for work and wages combined. She went to
    work, and got ten dollars a month. She has contrived to get some
    education, and has since been teaching school. While her former
    mistress has been to her for help.

    "Do not the mills of God grind exceedingly fine? And she has
    helped that mistress, and so has the colored man given money,
    from what I heard, to his former master. After all, friend, do
    we not belong to one of the best branches of the human race? And
    yet, how have our people been murdered in the South, and their
    bones scattered at the grave's mouth! Oh, when will we have a
    government strong enough to make human life safe? Only yesterday
    I heard of a murder committed on a man for an old grudge of
    several years' standing. I had visited the place, but had just
    got away. Last summer a Mr. Luke was hung, and several other men
    also, I heard."


While surrounded with this state of affairs, an appeal reached her
through the columns of the National Standard, setting forth a state of
very great suffering and want, especially on the part of the old, blind
and decrepit Freedmen of the District of Columbia. After expressing deep
pity for these unfortunates, she added: "Please send ten dollars to
Josephine Griffing for me for the suffering poor of the District of
Columbia. Just send it by mail, and charge to my account."

Many more letters written by Mrs. Harper are before us, containing
highly interesting information from Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida,
North Carolina, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Maryland, and
even poor little Delaware. Through all these States she has traveled and
labored extensively, as has been already stated; but our space in this
volume will admit of only one more letter:


    "I have been traveling the best part of the day.  *  *  *  Can
    you spare a little time from your book to just take a peep at
    some of our Alabama people? If you would see some instances of
    apparent poverty and ignorance that I have seen perhaps you
    would not wonder very much at the conservative voting in the
    State. A few days since I was about to pay a woman a dollar and
    a quarter for some washing in ten cent (currency) notes, when
    she informed me that she could not count it; she must trust to
    my honesty--she could count forty cents. Since I left Eufaula I
    have seen something of plantation life. The first plantation I
    visited was about five or six miles from Eufaula, and I should
    think that the improvement in some of the cabins was not very
    much in advance of what it was in Slavery. The cabins are made
    with doors, but not, to my recollection, a single window pane or
    speck of plastering; and yet even in some of those lowly homes I
    met with hospitality. A room to myself is a luxury that I do not
    always enjoy. Still I live through it, and find life rather
    interesting. The people have much to learn. The condition of the
    women is not very enviable in some cases. They have had some of
    them a terribly hard time in Slavery, and their subjection has
    not ceased in freedom.  *  *  *  One man said of some women,
    that a man must leave them or whip them.  *  *  *  Let me
    introduce you to another scene: here is a gathering; a large
    fire is burning out of doors, and here are one or two boys with
    hats on. Here is a little girl with her bonnet on, and there a
    little boy moves off and commences to climb a tree. Do you know
    what the gathering means? It is a school, and the teacher, I
    believe, is paid from the school fund. He says he is from New
    Hampshire. That may be. But to look at him and to hear him
    teach, you would perhaps think him not very lately from the
    North; at least I do not think he is a model teacher. They have
    a church; but somehow they have burnt a hole, I understand, in
    the top, and so I lectured inside, and they gathered around the
    fire outside. Here is another--what shall I call
    it?--meeting-place. It is a brush arbor. And what pray is that?
    Shall I call it an edifice or an improvised meeting-house? Well,
    it is called a brush arbor. It is a kind of brush house with
    seats, and a kind of covering made partly, I rather think, of
    branches of trees, and an humble place for pulpit. I lectured in
    a place where they seemed to have no other church; but I spoke
    at a house. In Glenville, a little out-of-the-way place, I spent
    part of a week. There they have two unfinished churches. One has
    not a single pane of glass, and the same aperture that admits
    the light also gives ingress to the air; and the other one, I
    rather think, is less finished than that. I spoke in one, and
    then the white people gave me a hall, and quite a number
    attended.... I am now at Union Springs, where I shall probably
    room with three women. But amid all this roughing it in the
    bush, I find a field of work where kindness and hospitality have
    thrown their sunshine around my way. And Oh what a field of work
    is here! How much one needs the Spirit of our dear Master to
    make one's life a living, loving force to help men to higher
    planes of thought and action. I am giving all my lectures with
    free admission; but still I get along, and the way has been
    opening for me almost ever since I have been South. Oh, if some
    more of our young women would only consecrate their lives to the
    work of upbuilding the race! Oh, if I could only see our young
    men and women aiming to build up a future for themselves which
    would grandly contrast with the past--with its pain, ignorance
    and low social condition."


It may be well to add that Mrs. Harper's letters from which we have
copied were simply private, never intended for publication; and while
they bear obvious marks of truthfulness, discrimination and
impartiality, it becomes us to say that a more strictly conscientious
woman we have never known.

Returning to Philadelphia after many months of hard labor in the South,
Mrs. Harper, instead of seeking needed rest and recreation, scarcely
allows a day to pass without seeking to aid in the reformation of the
outcast and degraded. The earnest advice which she gives on the subject
of temperance and moral reforms generally causes some to reflect, even
among adults, and induces a number of poor children to attend day and
Sabbath-schools. The condition of this class, she feels, appeals loudly
for a remedy to respectable and intelligent colored citizens; and whilst
not discouraged, she is often quite saddened at the supineness of the
better class. During the past summer when it was too warm to labor in
the South she spent several months in this field without a farthing's
reward. She assisted in organizing a Sabbath-school, and accepted the
office of Assistant Superintendent under the auspices of the Young Men's
Christian Association.

Mrs. Harper reads the best magazines and ablest weeklies, as well as
more elaborate works, not excepting such authors as De Tocqueville,
Mill, Ruskin, Buckle, Guizot, &c. In espousing the cause of the
oppressed as a poet and lecturer, had she neglected to fortify her mind
in the manner she did, she would have been weighed and found wanting
long since. Before friends and foes, the learned and the unlearned,
North and South, Mrs. Harper has pleaded the cause of her race in a
manner that has commanded the greatest respect; indeed, it is hardly too
much to say, that during seventeen years of public labor she has made
thousands of speeches without doing herself or people discredit in a
single instance, but has accomplished a great deal in the way of
removing prejudice. May we not hope that the rising generation at least
will take encouragement by her example and find an argument of rare
force in favor of mental and moral equality, and above all be awakened
to see how prejudices and difficulties may be surmounted by continual
struggles, intelligence and a virtuous character?

Fifty thousand copies at least of her four small books have been sold to
those who have listened to her eloquent lectures. One of those
productions entitled "Moses" has been used to entertain audiences with
evening readings in various parts of the country. With what effect may
be seen from the two brief notices as follows:


    "Mrs. F.E.W. Harper delivered a poem upon 'Moses' in Wilbraham
    to a large and delighted audience. She is a woman of high moral
    tone, with superior native powers highly cultivated, and a
    captivating eloquence that hold her audience in rapt attention
    from the beginning to the close. She will delight any
    intelligent audience, and those who wish first-class lecturers
    cannot do better than to secure her services."--_Zion's Herald,
    Boston._



    "Mrs. Frances E.W. Harper read her poem of 'Moses' last evening
    at Rev. Mr. Harrison's church to a good audience. It deals with
    the story of the Hebrew Moses from his finding in the wicker
    basket on the Nile to his death on Mount Nebo and his burial in
    an unknown grave; following closely the Scripture account. It
    contains about 700 lines, beginning with blank verse of the
    common measure, and changing to other measures, but always
    without rhyme; and is a pathetic and well-sustained piece. Mrs.
    Harper recited it with good effect, and it was well received.
    She is a lady of much talent, and always speaks well,
    particularly when her subject relates to the condition of her
    own people, in whose welfare, before and since the war, she has
    taken the deepest interest. As a lecturer Mrs. Harper is more
    effective than most of those who come before our lyceums; with a
    natural eloquence that is very moving."--_Galesburgh Register,
    Ill._


Grace Greenwood, in the Independent in noticing a Course of Lectures in
which Mrs. Harper spoke (in Philadelphia) pays this tribute to her:


    "Next on the course was Mrs Harper, a colored woman; about as
    colored as some of the Cuban belles I have met with at Saratoga.
    She has a noble head, this bronze muse; a strong face, with a
    shadowed glow upon it, indicative of thoughtful fervor, and of a
    nature most femininely sensitive, but not in the least morbid.
    Her form is delicate, her hands daintily small. She stands
    quietly beside her desk, and speaks without notes, with gestures
    few and fitting. Her manner is marked by dignity and composure.
    She is never assuming, never theatrical. In the first part of
    her lecture she was most impressive in her pleading for the race
    with whom her lot is cast. There was something touching in her
    attitude as their representative. The woe of two hundred years
    sighed through her tones. Every glance of her sad eyes was a
    mournful remonstrance against injustice and wrong. Feeling on
    her soul, as she must have felt it, the chilling weight of
    caste, she seemed to say:

      'I lift my heavy heart up solemnly,
      As once Eleotra her sepulchral urn.'


    ... As I listened to her, there swept over me, in a chill wave
    of horror, the realization that this noble woman had she not
    been rescued from her mother's condition, might have been sold
    on the auction-block, to the highest bidder--her intellect,
    fancy, eloquence, the flashing wit, that might make the delight
    of a Parisian saloon, and her pure, Christian character all
    thrown in--the recollection that women like her could be dragged
    out of public conveyances in our own city, or frowned out of
    fashionable churches by Anglo-Saxon saints."

WHAT HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT IT



       *       *       *       *       *


At the closing meeting of the PENNSYLVANIA ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY, held in
Philadelphia, May 5, 1870, the following was unanimously passed:

Whereas, The position of WILLIAM STILL in the Vigilance Committee
connected with the "UNDERGROUND RAILROAD," as its Corresponding
Secretary, and Chairman of its Active Sub-Committee, gave him peculiar
facilities for collecting interesting facts pertaining to this branch of
the anti-slavery service; therefore,

_Resolved_, That the PENNSYLVANIA ANTI-SLAVERY SOCIETY requests him to
compile and publish his personal reminiscences and experiences relating
to the "UNDERGROUND RAILROAD."


       *       *       *       *       *


HON. JOHN W. FORNEY, in a letter to the Washington _Sunday Chronicle_,
said:

"Slavery and its mysterious inner life has never yet been described.
When it is, Reality will surpass Fiction. Uncle Tom's Cabin will be
rebuilt and newly garnitured. A book, detailing the operations of the
'UNDERGROUND RAILROAD,' is soon to be published in Philadelphia, by WM.
STILL, Esq., an intelligent colored gentleman, which, composed entirely
of facts, will supply material for indefinite dramas and romances. It
will disclose a record of unparalleled courage and suffering for the
right."  *  *  *  *  *

And again, in a letter to the same paper, Mr. Forney says:

*  *  *  *  "A coincidence even more romantic is soon to be revealed in
the pages of the _remarkable book_ of Wm. Still, of Philadelphia,
entitled 'THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD,' referred to in my last. Mr. Still
kept a careful memorandum of the sufferings and trials of his race
during the existence of the 'Fugitive Slave Law,' in the belief that
they would be instructive to his posterity, rather than from any hope of
the overthrow of the revolting system of human servitude  *  *  *  he
resolved to spread before the world this _unprecedented_ experience.
When his book appears, it will accomplish more than one object.
Interesting to the literary world, it will undoubtedly facilitate the
reunion of other colored families long divided, long sought for, and
perhaps to this day strangers to each other.  *  *  *  *  The volume
containing this and other equally romantic yet truthful stories will
soon be out, and, _my word for it, no book of the times will be more
eagerly read or more profitably remembered._"


       *       *       *       *       *


The San Francisco _Elevator_ says:

*  *  *  *  "Mr. Still is one of the pioneers of 'THE UNDERGROUND
RAILROAD' in Philadelphia, where he still resides. He has aided more
slaves to escape than any other man, Bishop Lougan, of Syracuse,
_perhaps_ excepted.  *  *  *  *  We hope his book will have a wide
circulation, as it will be a valuable addition to the history of the
anti-slavery struggle _such as no other man can write._"


       *       *       *       *       *


Having been, during many years, associated with WILLIAM STILL, in
laboring for the abolition of American slavery, we heartily bear our
testimony to his abundant opportunities for acquiring information
relative to the subject of this book; and to his vigilance and fidelity
in all the departments of anti-slavery work in which he was engaged, and
especially in that department usually called "THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD."

We gladly avail ourselves of this opportunity to express our confidence
in his ability to present to the public an authentic and interesting
history of this enterprise.

Certainly no volume ever met with higher or more extensive endorsement.
From the time the author announced his intention to prepare a book from
his notes and records until it was given to the public, it was the
subject of favorable comment by leading minds of the country, without
reference to race. Since its publication it has received the endorsement
of the Press generally, and of Statesmen, Preachers, Lawyers, Doctors,
Students, in fact men of all ranks.



Brief Extracts from Letters to the Author by Prominent Men.


_FROM HON. HENRY WILSON, LATE VICE PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES_.

I have glanced over a few pages of your History of the Underground
Railroad, _and I most earnestly commend it_. You have done a good work.
This story of the heroic conduct of fugitives from oppression, and of
the devotion of their friends, will be read with deep interest,
especially by the old friends of the slave in the stern struggle through
which we have passed. I hope your labors will be rewarded by a grateful
public.


       *       *       *       *       *


_FROM HORACE GREELEY_.

_Dear Sir:_--For most of the years I have lived, the escape of fugitives
from slavery, and their efforts to baffle the human and other
bloodhounds who tracked them, formed the romance of American History.
That romance is now ended, and our grandchildren will hardly believe its
leading incidents except on _irresistible testimony_. I rejoice that you
are collecting and presenting _that testimony_, and heartily wish you a
great success.


       *       *       *       *       *


_FROM HON. CHARLES SUMMER, LATE U.S. SENATOR FROM MASS._

The Underground Railroad has performed its part, but must always be
remembered gratefully, as one of the peculiar institutions of our
country. I cannot think of it without a throbbing heart.

You do well to commemorate those associated with it by service or by
benefit--the saviors and the saved. The army of the late war has had its
"Roll of Honor." You will give us two other, rolls, worthy of equal
honor--the roll of fugitives from slavery, helped on their way to
freedom, and also the roll of their self-sacrificing benefactors. I
always hesitated which to honor most, the fugitive slave or the citizen
who helped him, in defiance of unjust laws. Your book will teach us to
honor both.


       *       *       *       *       *


_FROM JOHN G. WHITTIER_.

The story of the escaped fugitives--the perils, the terrors of pursuit
and re-capture--the shrewdness which baffled the human blood-hounds--the
untiring zeal and devotion of the friends of the slave in the free
States, are well described.

_The book is more interesting than any romance_. It will be of permanent
value to the historian of the country, during the anti-slavery struggle.

_I cheerfully commend it to the public favor_.


       *       *       *       *       *


_FROM J. WHEATON SMITH, D.D._

I am happy to find that material for this interesting work exists. I had
feared that much which will be here recorded, would perish with the
brave and worthy men who were personally interested. These verities of
history contain the interest of romance, and our children's children
will read them with wonder and admiration.

_FROM, HON. S.P. CHASE, LATE CHIEF JUSTICE U.S. SUPREME COURT_.

_Your book will certainly be an interesting one. No one probably has had
equal opportunities with yourself of listening to the narratives of
fugitive slaves. No one will repeat them more truthfully, and no stories
can be more fraught with interest than theirs_. Let us rejoice, that, in
our country, such narratives can never be heard again.

_FROM WM. LLOYD GARRISON_.

I congratulate you that, after much patient research, careful
preparation, and untiring labor, you have completed your voluminous work
on "THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD." I am sure your work will be found to be
_one of absorbing interest, worthy of the widest patronage, and
historically valuable as pertaining to the tremendous struggle for the
abolition of chattel slavery in our land. No phase of that struggle was
so crowded wifh thrilling incidents, heroic adventures, and
self-sacrificing efforts as the one you have undertaken to portray, and
with which you were so closely connected, to wit:_ "THE UNDERGROUND
RAILROAD." While it will be contemplated with shame, sadness, and
astonishment, by posterity, it will serve vividly to illustrate the
perils which everywhere confronted the fugitives from the Southern
"house of bondage," and to which those who dared to give them food and
shelter were also subjected.


       *       *       *       *       *


_FROM GEN. O.O. HOWARD_.

You could not prepare a work that would afford more instruction and
interest to me than a detailed history of the operations of the
so-called "UNDERGROUND RAILROAD." _I am delighted_ at the casual
examination I have been permitted to give it. Thousands will rise up to
call you blessed for your faithful record of our "legalized crime," and
its graphic terrible consequences set forth by you in _such true
pictures and plain words_.


       *       *       *       *       *


_HON. CARL SCHURZ, SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR_.

I have no doubt you can make the narrative a very interesting
contribution to the history of an important period of our national
development. It will be calculated to strengthen in the whole American
people a just sense of the beneficent results of the great social
revolution we have achieved, and to inspire the people of your own race
with a high appreciation of the blessings of liberty they now enjoy.


       *       *       *       *       *


_FROM HON. W.D. KELLEY, CONGRESSMAN FROM PA._

The stories you tell with admirable simplicity and directness of the
suffering heroically endured by such numbers of poor fugitives, will
instruct and inspire many who have regarded the American slave as a
member of an inferior race.

_Office_ "THE PRESS," _Philadelphia, Pa.__My Dear Sir:_--I have read
most of the proof sheets of your forthcoming book, entitled "THE
UNDERGROUND RAILROAD," and have just examined the letter-press
preparatory to its publication, and the accompanying engravings, and I
cannot refrain from stating, that I believe it to be a consummate work
of its kind. Its chief merit, of course, consists in its _extraordinary
revelations_ of the injustice and cruelty of the dead system of slavery,
but it is gratifying to notice that it will be printed and sent forth to
the world in so complete and admirable a style, _I commend it most
cheerfully as a book that every citizen should have in his library._
Very truly, yours,

JNO. W. FORNEY.

_FROM, J. MILLER MCKIM._

I have read your book with feelings of mingled pleasure and pride;
pleasure at the valuable contribution which it furnishes to anti-slavery
history and anti-slavery literature, and pride that you are the author
of it.

But the chief value of the book will be found in its main narratives,
which illustrate to the life the character of slavery, the spirit and
temper of the men engaged for its overthrow, and the difficulties which
had to be overcome by these men in the accomplishment of their purpose.

A book so unique in kind, so startling in interest, and so trustworthy
in its statements, cannot fail to command a large reading now, and in
generations yet to come. That you--my long tried friend and
associate--are the author of this book, is to me a matter of great pride
and delight.

You will please accept my thanks for the opportunity given me to examine
your record of the struggle for freedom by the slave and his friends. It
will doubtless be a work of great interest to many of our citizens.

_FROM THE NORTH AMERICAN AND  U.S. GAZETTE._

Here is an authority that cannot be questioned, competent and correct by
many endorsements, that shows without argument, after the true pattern
of Herodotus and the chroniclers, what slavery in America was in the
decade immediately preceding its overthrow.

_FROM THE "PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER."_

"Never before has the working of the Underground Railroad been so
thoroughly explained. Here we have in complete detail the various
methods adopted for circumventing the enemies of freedom, and told, as
it is, with great simplicity and natural feeling, the narrative is one
which cannot but make a deep impression. Thrilling incidents, heroic
adventures and noble deeds of self-sacrigce light up every page, and
will enlist the heartiest sympathies of all generous souls. It was
eminently just that such a record of one of the most remarkable phases
of the struggle against slavery should be prepared, that the memory of
the noble originators and supporters of the railroad might be kept
green, and posterity enabled to form a true conception of the necessity
that called it into existence, and of the difficulties under which its
work was performed. The labor of compiling could not have fallen into
more appropriate or better qualified hands."

_FROM THE "BALTIMORE AMERICAN."_

Mr. Still was one of the most courageous managers on the Underground
Ralroad, and is therefore well qualified to be its historian. He speaks
of his own services with modesty, and, in fact, there is no attempt at
exaggeration in any one of the most wonderful series of narratives which
he relates. Baltimore was one of the great depots from which the
trembling fugitives set out on their trip to Canada, and Mr. Still deals
freely with the names of person, yet living, who, no doubt, would be
very glad if this most extraordinary book had never been published. It
was their misfortune to have furnished a number of passengers for the
"Underground Railroad," and now they cannot escape being named in
connection with the slaves, who dared, everything for liberty.

_FROM THE SAN FRANCISCO BULLETIN._

We have often longed to know how the drab-coated philanthropists of
Philadelphia managed to furnish systematic assistance to the slave
fugitives, and the desire is now gratified. William Still, for many
years connected with the anti-slavery office in Philadelphia, and the
chairman of the Acting Vigilance Committee of the Philadelphia Branch of
the Underground Railroad, has written a ponderous volume, entitled "THE
UNDERGROUND RALROAD." ... He has performed his work well. The volume
before us, though containing nearly 800 pages, is not elaborated beyond
necessity, and fairly teems with interesting sketches.

_FROM BISHOP PAYNE OF THE A.M.E. CHURCH, PHILADELPHIA._

My official engagements and private duties have prevented me from
reading your work on THE UNDERGROUND RAILROAD, throughout. But such
portions as I have had time to read, convince me that as a stimulus to
noble effort it has much value. It is also a grand _monument_ of the
past struggles of the Angel Spirit of Liberty with the Demon of American
Slavery. It serves also as a Beacon Light for our future progress in the
upward movement. It deserves a wide circulation through the Republic.

_FROM LETTER OF HON. EBENEZER D. BASSETT, U.S. MINISTER TO HAITI._

The book must strike everyone who sees it as one of very commendable
appearance; and to everyone who reads it, it must commend itself as one
of remarkable interest. It is a work which cannot fail to reflect an
unusual credit upon the care, industry and sterling ability of its
author.

All hail to you, my dear fellow, for your success. When nearly four
years ago you spoke often to me about your project of writing this book,
I always told you I thought it would prove a success; but I tell you
now, candidly, that although I never for a moment doubted your peculiar
fitness to prepare such a work, yet I feared that when you came to see
the time, industry, care and patience, which it would require aside from
your pressing everyday business cares and perplexities, you might stop
at the foot of the mountain and abandon the tedious ascent. But you have
actually made the ascent and stand now on the top of the mountain.
Hurrah for my old friend Still! Hurrah! Hurrah!! Hurrah!!!

_FROM. PROF. W. HOWARD DAY, IN "OUR NATIONAL PROGRESS."_

In his singularly and creditably brief preface, Mr. Still sincerely
disclaims literary pretension; but creditable as is this to the author,
we may say that the work is in style excellent reading, and that if it
were not so, the narratives themselves are so thrilling, possess such a
heart-reaching interest, that if these were literary crudities, they
would be entirely placed in the background in the concentrated blaze of
light which the author pours upon the bloody pathway of these victims of
injustice, from 1851, when the terrors of the Fugitive Slave Law began,
to the hour when Slavery and Rebellion were washed out in blood,
together.

We have not space for a reprint of one of these interesting histories,
but we are personally acquainted with the "facts" as related by Mr.
Still, and the persons involved, and can attest the truth of the
statements made. Some of these parties we have met in their flight,
others in their temporary sojourn in the then so-called Free States;
others we knew (Harriet Tubman and Moses among them) in their latest and
safest refuge, (Canada,) under the protection of the Cross of St. George
and St. Andrew. It was due to such that this book should be written.
Their heroic deeds, in behalf of personal liberty of themselves and
others, deserve commemorating. Their deeds of daring, winning victory at
last, in the face of wily and unscrupulous men devoted to their capture,
and sustained by the voice, the law and the cannon of the Government,
ought to be written in unfading letters across the history of a people
struggling upward to enfranchisement. It will teach the coming
generations who were our fathers and our mothers; who there were in
these years of agony who braved death to secure liberty and who upheld
the noble banner of a dying race until their efforts, by God's blessing,
made the race rise and live. All thanks to Mr. Still for thus placing
this noble record of the free, and those struggling to be free, before
the world.

_FROM, THE BOSTON JOURNAL, BOSTON, MASS._

The present volume is a narrative, or rather a collection of narratives,
of the adventures of slaves on their way to freedom. The style is
perfectly simple and unaffected, and it is well that it is so. The facts
and incidents related are themselves so full of interest and dramatic
intenseness as to need no coloring. The narratives throughout have the
mark of truth upon them, and are based on authentic records. American
history would not be complete without some such book as this, written by
one within the circle of those devoted philanthropists who were so
fearless and unremitting in their efforts for human freedom.

_FROM THE PROVIDENCE PRESS, PROVIDENCE, R.I._

This large volume is full of facts. To read its pages is to bring the
past up with vividness. Many of those who fought with the worse than
Ephesus' beasts encountered by Paul, to wit, the man-hunters of the
South, we knew personally, and their narratives as given in this volume
we can vouch for, having received their accounts at the time, from their
own lips. Historically the book is valuable, because it is fact and not
fiction, although fifty years from to-day it will read like fiction to
the then living.

It is not a romance, but it is a storehouse of materials which will
hereafter be used in literature, and be studied, not only by historians,
dramatists and novelists, but also by those who will seek to comprehend
and realize the fact, that there has been, in this country, a condition
of society and law which made the Underground railroad possible.

AN AUTHENTIC RECORD OF THE WONDERFUL HARDSHIPS, HAIRBREADTH ESCAPES, AND
DEATH STRUGGLES WHICH MARK THE TRACK FROM SLAVERY TO FREEDOM IN THE
UNITED STATES.


       *       *       *       *       *


This is one of the most remarkable volumes of the century. Its
publication has only been made possible by a combination of
circumstances which seldom attend the birth of a book. Before
emancipation, and while the bane of slavery was on the country, the
thrilling facts of this volume could not have been made public. Peace
and the blessing of freedom permit their publication, free circulation
and unmolested reading.

Of all the thousands who favored freedom for the slaves, who gloried in
the odium attached to anti-slaveryism, who witnessed the frequent
efforts of the bondsmen to escape, who aided them in their quest for
liberty, few dared to take notes of what they witnessed, and fewer still
dared to preserve them, lest they should be turned into witnesses
against them.

But one man, and that the author of this book, is known to have
succeeded in preserving anything like a full account of the workings of
the UNDERGROUND RAILROAD, as it was called before emancipation. These
records grew on his hands during the years he acted as Chairman of the
Philadelphia Branch of that celebrated corporation, until they reached
the extent of the present volume. They are made up of letters received,
of interviews held, of narratives taken down at the time, of real
reminiscence and authentic biography. Nothing imaginative enters into
the composition of the volume. It is simply succinct history, always
startling, sometimes bloody. The annals of no time since the Inquisition
are so full of daring ventures for life and liberty or heroic endurance
under most trying circumstances.

As a history of the UNDERGROUND RAILROAD, the work is most curious and
valuable. It tells of an ingenuity and faithfulness on the part of the
officials of the road which seems well-nigh marvellous. As its pages
reveal the methods by which aid was given to the escaping slave, one is
compelled to wonder almost as if he were facing a revelation. The
secrets of Masonry are not more mysterious than were the ways of these
officials who clothed, fed and comforted the fugitive, while they
apparently never knew his name or whereabouts. Even those who never
believed in the existence of an UNDERGROUND RAILWAY, or who, believing,
cursed its existence, will read its history, at this time, with the
relish of astonishment and the zest of discoverers.

But the book has a higher meaning and use. It is curious and hitherto
unprinted history to the white race. To the black race, and especially
that part of it once slave, it is more than a history of a time of
peril. It is for them what Exodus was to the fugitives from Egypt, a
history and an inspiration as well. They may learn from it of their
heroes and how deeply the love of liberty was implanted in their bosoms.
The Swiss never tire of the story of their Tell, nor the Welsh of that
of their Glendower. Every nation has its exemplar, whose bravery and
virtues are a perpetual lesson and source of admiration. The colored
race may now read of its real heroes, its Joshuas, Spartacuses, Tells
and Glendowers, among the list of those who silently broke their chains
and dared everything in order to breathe the sweet air of liberty. They
are not blazoned heroes, full of loud deeds and great names, but quiet
examples of what fortitude can achieve where freedom is the goal.

It is time now that the colored race should know something of the steps
which led from Egypt to Canaan, something of their own contributions to
the grand march of the tribes across and beyond the Red Sea. There are
no slaves beneath the starry flag. All may read who will, and what they
will. For the colored man no history can be more instructive and
inspiring than this, of his own making, and written by one of his own
race. The generations are growing in light. Not to know of those who
were stronger than shackles, who were pioneers in the grand advance
toward freedom; not to know of what characters the race could produce
when straightened by circumstances, nor of those small beginnings which
ended in triumphant emancipation, will, in a short time, be a reproach.

This History of the hardships and struggles of those of their own race
is more for them than for mankind at large. It furnishes the world proof
that, though slaves, they were nevertheless men. It furnishes them proof
that the heroic abounds in their race as in others, and that achievement
follows persistent effort, as well with them as with others. The volume
will be not only their admiration but constant encouragement. In its
pages one is not invited to hard, dry reading. It is narrative in style,
simple in language, and possesses the thrill and pathos of a novel. In
all its parts it is an evidence of the saying that "Truth is stranger
than fiction."

The author scarcely needs an introduction to the public. He is a
scholarly, successful business man of Philadelphia, who has long been
identified with churches, charities and every project for ameliorating
the condition of his race. His word in all things is as good as his
bond. An ardent member of the Anti-Slavery Society, and an active
officer of the Underground Railroad Company, he made his book as a
business man makes his ledger, viz.: by noting daily the transactions of
the day. How he preserved them does not matter much now, but if a
certain loft in the chapel of an old cemetery could speak, it might a
tale unfold.

The volume is quite large and commanding in appearance. It consists of
about 800 pages, clearly printed on beautiful white paper, making the
largest book ever written by a colored person in this country.

An attractive feature of the book, one which has added largely to its
cost, and one which greatly enhances its value to the reader, is its
illustrations. These are over seventy in number, and they are made to
illustrate the most striking portions of the work. They represent night
escapes and day encounters, on land and river, receptions on the soil of
freedom, characters of note among the fugitives, and many of those among
the anti-slavery people whose names have become historic. It is seldom a
volume is seen which so abounds in apt and striking illustration.

The field for the sale of this volume is immense. It will prove
desirable as a curious contribution to the literature of the times, and
will be bought in every home North and South, East and West, where
reading is cherished. It is pre-eminently the book for the colored race.
There is not a colored man or woman in the whole land who will not want
to possess it. Even if he cannot read, he will want it for his children.
It will be their history and their story for generations.

We have fixed the price at a very low figure, so as to completely answer
all pleas of poverty or hard times.

The whole book of _800 SUPER-ROYAL OCTAVO PAGES_ is filled with the
thrilling History of the Secret work of the U.G.R.R., giving an
authentic account of the wonderful Escapes and Daring Deeds, the
Endurance and Sacrifice of men and women in their efforts for freedom.
It is BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATED and substantially bound, and furnished at

_FROM THE "NATION," N.Y._

It is, nevertheless, a chapter in our history which connot be skipped or
obliterated, inasmuch as it marks one stage of the disease of which the
crisis was passed at Gettysburg. It is one, too, for which we ought not
to be dependent on tradition; and, all things considered, no one was so
well qualified as Mr. Still to reproduce that phase of it with which he
was so intimately concerned, as chairman of the Acting Committee of the
Vigilance Committee of Philadelphia.

Of all the Border States, Pennsylvania was the most accessible to
fugitives from slavery; and as the organization just named was probably
the most perfect and efficient of its kind, and served as a distributor
to the branches in other States, its record doubtless covers the larger
part of the field of operations of the Underground Railroad; or, in
other words, of the systematic but secret efforts to promote the escape
of slaves.

_FROM THE CHRISTIAN UNION, N.Y._

"The narratives themselves, told with the simplicity and directness of
obvious truth, are full of terror, of pathos, the shame of human
baseness and the glory of human virtue; and though the time is not yet
sufficiently distant from the date of their occurrence to give to this
record the universal acceptance it deserves, there are few, we think,
even now, who can read it without amazement that such things could be in
our very day, and be regarded with such general apathy. When the
question, still so momentous and exciting, of the relations of the two
races in this country, shall have passed from the vortex of political
strife and social prejudice, and taken its place among the ethical
axioms of a Christian civilization, then this faithful account of some
of the darkest and some of the brightest incidents in our history--this
cyclopædia of all the virtues and all the vices of humanity--will be
accepted as a most valuable contribution to the annals of one of the
important eras of the world."

_FROM THE "LUTHERAN OBSERVER," PHILADELPHIA._

"It is a remarkable book in many respects. Like the 'Key to Uncle Tom's
Cabin,' by Mrs. Stowe, it reveals many of the most thrilling personal
dramas and tragedies in the entire history of slavery. That 'truth is
stranger than fiction' has hundreds of striking illustrations in this
volume, which is a narrative of facts, the records of which were kept by
Mr. Still, and are the only records in existence of the famous
organization known as the Underground Railroad. It was established for
the purpose of aiding slaves to escape from their masters in the South,
but its operations were so mysterious and secret that, although
everybody knew and spoke vaguely of its existence during the time of
slavery, yet none but the initiated knew the secrets of its management
and operations. These are now revealed for the first time in this work,
and are as strange and wonderful as the most absorbing pictures of
romance."

_FROM, THE CHRISTIAN RECORDER, PHILA._

There has been no such work produced by any colored man in the country.
"My Bondage and my Freedom," by Douglass, was a remarkable book, and was
justly appreciated by the liberty-loving people of the North and of
England, but it was the story of a single hero. Comparatively, the same
may be said of the lives of Jermain Logan and others. But all these were
but the exploits of individuals. The work of Mr. Still, however, takes a
broader scope. It is the story of scores of heroes--heroes that equalled
Douglass in nerve, and Logan in tact, and excelled either in thrilling
adventure.

_FROM "ZION'S HERALD," BOSTON._

"It is a big book in manner, matter, and spirit; the biggest book
America has yet written. It is our 'Book of Martyrs,' and William Still
is our Fox the Chronicler. It is the 'thousand witnesses' of Theodore
Weld, enlarged and intensified. It is more than Uncle Tom, Wilson's
'History of the Anti-slavery War,' or the hundred histories of the war
itself....

"The book is well illustrated with portraits of the railroad managers,
and with scenes taken from life, and is far the most entertaining and
instructive story ever issued from the American press. Everybody should
buy, read, and transmit to his children these annals of our heroic age."

_FROM THE "MORNING STAR," DOVER, NEW HAMPSHIRE._

"The work is intensely interesting. Many of the narratives thrill the
reader through and through. Some of them awaken an indignation, a
horror, or a sense of humiliation and shame that makes the blood curdle
or the cheek flush, or the breathing difficult. The best and the worst
sides of human nature are successfully exhibited. Here heroism and
patience stand out transfigured; there selfishness and brutality hold
carnival till it seems as though justice had been exiled and God had
forgotten his own. The number of cases reported is very large, and the
method in which the author has done his work is commendable. There is no
rhetorical ambition. The narratives are embodied in plain language. The
facts are left to make their own impression, without an attempt to
embellish them by the aid of imagination. And the work is timely."

_FROM THE "FRIENDS' REVIEW," PHILADELPHIA._

"We are glad to see this book. We anticipate for it a large circulation,
and a permanent rank in a peculiar and painful department of history.
The writer is one among very many who are entitled to the hearty support
of philanthropists for their services rendered, often at considerable
sacrifices and imminent peril, for the rescue and aid of those who were
wickedly held in bondage.... The _Underground Railroad_ should have a
place in every comprehensive library, private or public.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
