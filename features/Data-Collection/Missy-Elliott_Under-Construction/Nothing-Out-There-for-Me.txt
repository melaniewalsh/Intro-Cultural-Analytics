Ain't nothin' out there for me (Come on)

Ain't nothin' out there for me, this is where I wanna be
I done already been in the streets
And ain't came across nothin' so sweet
He's the only man that I love, and I don't need more than one
So don't worry when I'm hangin' out
He's the only one that I'm thinkin' about

I know he's insecure, everytime I leave out the door
(You lettin' him spoil yo' night? Live ya life, you ain't even his wife)
He ain't gotta worry bout' me cuz' I got somethin' more sweet
(Oh, you must got a diamond ring)
And I know I'm so lucky ain't nothin'
