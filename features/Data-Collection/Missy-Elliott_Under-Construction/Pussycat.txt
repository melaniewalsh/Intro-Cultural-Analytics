Uh, this is another Missy Elliott exclusive, uh, come on

It's all for the love
But there is more things that keep a man satisfied
And I know the remedy just to cure him
From cheating even if he tried, hey

Pussy don't fail me now
I gotta turn this nigga out
So he don't want nobody else
But me and only me
Pussy don't fail me now
I gotta turn this nigga out
So he don't want nobody else
But me and only me

I know he's a man and men have intentions
To sleep with someone else
But that's why when I make love to him
I'm ruling
Try to give him my best, hey

Pussy don't fail me now (fail me now)
I gotta turn this nigga out
So he don't want nobody else (nobody)
But me and only me (ohh)
Pussy don't fail me now (fail me now)

As long as the pussy good it's alright
Ain't gotta worry bout my man
Cos he know mine's is one of a kind
And that's why he keeps staying
The pussy good, it's alright
Ain't gotta worry bout my man
Cos he know mine's is one of a kind
And that's why he keeps staying

Look ma
Yeah, you got that bomb and work
That prissy stuff, glad it ain't that gushy stuff (that gushy stuff?)
I don't like the mushy butts
I wish we was like Puffy over Jennifer
Him and her too much like I and we (And what that mean?)
We just love the booty
All we see, in 3D, is um
Booty, booty, booty, booty

Oh really? Do me, do me, do me, do me
Run through me like flood go through an I-V
That's good I'm a make sure you never will leave
Can I put my booty, booty up in your spaghetti daddy
Are you ready for some cavi from me
Pussy, gushy, mushy, what more you want from me
Cuz my feelings hit the ceiling what you want me to be?
Oh please pussy don't mess it up for me, come on

Pussy don't fail me now (fail me, now)

So he don't want nobody else (nobody else)
But me and only me

What's the deal y'all?
I don't mean to come thru and break y'all vibe
But, I just gotta slow it down for just a second, so bear with me
You know, first before I do that I just wanna talk about how people Always say: 'Yo that's too nasty' and 'Why yo mouth so vulgar?'
'Why you gotta-why you gotta sing all these nasty records?'
And all that, but I be representin' for the ladies and
We got somethin' to say, we've been quiet too long
Lady-like, very patient
We ain't get mad when Prince had his ass out
We thought he was gonna turn around to the front
And have the front out too! But you know, that didn't happen
We always had to deal with-with the guys
You know, talkin' about how they gon' wear us out on records
And-and you know so I had to do records that was strictly--
Representin' for my ladies and how to keep yo man
Keep his eyes from wandering, looking around
And, sex is not a topic that we should always sweep under the rug
I'm not sayin' go out and do it, but if you do
Strap it up, before you smack it up
Flip it, slow it down, oh no!
Jimmy, drop it
