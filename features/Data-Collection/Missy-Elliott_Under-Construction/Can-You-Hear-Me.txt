I been checkin' on your moms and dad (uh)
And your brother since the day you left (left)
Passed on and went away with God (uh)
But for your momma its been so damn hard
I hate to even hear her cry (cry)
Aaliyah she asked me why (why)
Would her baby girl go this way (oh)
Can you give me better words to say

Come one day she'll see you again
With the same ol' beatiful smile
Long hair and the voice of a hummin' bird
You'll be singing them same ol' songs
Aaliyah can you hear me
I hope that you're proud of me
Me and Tim we been doin' our thing
But its never been the same since you had to go
I ain't never met a friend more incredible
Ohhh...

With God but damn I miss you
Aaliyah if you see Left Eye

Cuz no one's gonna fill her space (uh uh)

With the same ol' beautiful smile
Crazy but sexy cool

TLC has come a long way
But its never been the same since you had to go
Cuz the healin' process will be long and slow

Aaliyah I know you're in a safer place
You're face to face with the creator and our maker
And if you and Left Eye happen to chat
Tell her me and Tionne we know she's much safer
If you see Biggie smalls up in the clouds
Tell him he's still the illest emcee we had around
2Pac there is only one, Big Pun R.I.P
