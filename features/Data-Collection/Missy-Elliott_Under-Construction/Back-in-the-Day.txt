"Brothers and sisters!
Brothers and sisters, I don't know what this world is coming to!"

Whassup, Missy? Timbo!

Exclusive (Yes, uh)

One for the butters, I came from the gutter
No I came from my mother but y'all know what I mean
Hov' is here to stay like permanent crease in your jeans
Me and Missy be the new Tag Team

We like, Rae & Ghost, A.G. and Showbiz
We "Public Enemy #1," our "Uzi Weighs a Ton"
This is our house, Run! hahaha

What happened to those good old days? (Huh?)
When hip-hop, was so much fun
Ohh, house parties in the summer y'all (C'mon)
And no one, came through with a gun (A guh-un)
It was all about good music y'all
It helped to relieve some stress (Huh?)
Ohh, we was under one groove y'all (Y'all)
So much love between North and West

Go back in the day
British Knights and gold chains
Do the prep and cabbage patch
And wear your laces all fat
Back in the dayyyyyyyy, hey hey
Hip-Hop has chaaaanged

Remember when we used to battle? (Uh huh)
On the block before the lights came on (Yeah)
Ohh! Mama said we would be straight A kids (Come on)
If we did our homework, like we knew those songs

From day KRS-One all the way up to Nineteen Naughty Three
To M.O.P., we Cold as Ice
Nigga, we rock it from the "Dre Day" to the Suge Knight
So fuck Chuck Phillips and Bill O'Reilly
If they try to stop hip-hop, we all gon' rally, nigga
Post Biggie and 'Pac I gotta hold down the city
Make a nigga wanna holla like Missy, but fuck it
Just let a nigga MC
The best rapper alive, unquestionably
If you riff on your EP, you gonna need an MD
So you gots to chill cause I kill at will
Like solid water dude; y'all niggas don't get it
"Kill at Will," solid water? Ice Cube
Ha ha, that's how hip-hop has evolved
Jay-Z's for President, I'm namin Ra as the National God

Me and Jigga, Jigga J-J-Jay-Hova
I rocks the mic right whether I'm pissin' drunk or sober
Misdemeanor fo'-finger ringer I'm stupid FRESH

Yes yes, the yes yes, the yes y'alln
C'mon... AW YEA, AW YEA
Okay, me, that nigga Jigga, fresh dressed in the mornin'
C'mon... AW YEA, AW YEA

Go back in the day
British Knights and gold chains
Do the prep and cabbage patch
And wear your laces all fat
Back in the dayyyyyyyy, hey hey
Hip-Hop has chaaaanged
{*ad libs and whistling*}

I wanna, go back in, time (let's go)
Feels like I, I wanna, go back in, time
Feels like I (Y'all remember "Self Destruction"?)
I wanna, go back in, time
(Where all the rap artists got on a record together?)
Feels like I, I wanna, go back in, time
(I used to love them days, no tension, let's go!!)

Go back in the day
British Knights and gold chains
Do the prep and cabbage patch
And wear your laces all fat
Back in the dayyyyyyyy, hey hey
Hip-Hop has chaaaanged
